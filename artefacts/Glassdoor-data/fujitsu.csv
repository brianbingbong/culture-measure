No projects , Management is worst not giving hike and still asking to stay.
If he/ she is getting good hike outside they will just give half amount and will ask to retain how can they expect this. In short Management is worst ,not respecting there employees , HR behaviour is worst as if they are giving salary to us. Superior behaves very bad with associates , mental pressure is there.
Work life balance is not there if he/ she is in project need to work late nights but not hike no appraisal no motivation nothing.
","WFM team is worst threatening the employees to take any projects not as per the skill . WFM ( Resource Management) .
Managers are not replying the mail's or messages for any concern not HR nor any superior need to wait for 4-5 days for their reply . Just horrible experience as fresher.

","In the short time i have worked at Fujitsu, i have found that most but not all staff are not too friendly, most don't even acknowledge or look at you when you greet them. I was not given any training or even an introduction into the process involved to doing my job then they question my numbers are not up to standard, after only 4 weeks? Mind you, they give me the jobs no one else wants to do and then compared my numbers to staff that are doing completely different equipment and who have also been there for a minimum of 3 yrs. I managed to get a ""Good work"" from a boss higher up, but then get questioned by some ""know it all"" in a different state (QLD), he asks if I am doing all necessary tests? You don't question someones work methods after they have been told they are doing a good job, you question them when they are doing poorly then you seek to help them! Not to mention my Team leaders sat there silent and didn't even come to my defence.
They also tried to put the blame on me for a part number being entered into the system incorrectly and wanted me to fix it? Hold on, if you go to the base of the problem, there is a less likely chance for it to happen again. I don't mind correcting it but don't point the finger at me and make me fix it every time it happens!

This may be the most toxic environment i have ever worked at.

2021-08-29, Service Manager,,"Current Employee, less than 1 year",Don't expect a pay rise,"Large company with lots of opportunities for development.
","NO PAY RISES - NOT EVEN TO KEEP UP WITH INFLATION. All I keep hearing from colleagues and managers is ""I haven't had a pay rise for years."" One colleague had no pay rise for 8 years, my manager no pay rise for 5 years. Was told by manager we only get pay rises if we get promoted and has been like this for years. Suggested only way company will listen is when people vote with their feet (leave). Don't think I'll be staying too long if the company think this is an acceptable way to treat colleagues who work very hard to make the company millions in profit and pay senior leaders large bonuses.
Advice to Management
Value and respect your staff by awarding an annual pay rise that will at least keep up with inflation - otherwise you are effectively cutting peoples pay and eroding their morale and motivation.

","Too many to list. Extremely toxic work environment, senior management is sub par, at best, plenty of sharks in the water who are nice to your face and can't wait to stab you in the back the first chance they get. Lots of egos and sexism is alive and well. There is zero work/life balance; a typical work day is anywhere between 12-16 hours. The company culture and innovation is so behind the times. Nothing current in their tech stack to effectively get your job done. Unrealistic timelines for deliverables with little or no time to get things done properly or correctly. The tech needs to come into this century if they are to continue.
Advice to Management
I tried several times to give feedback or advice and each time it fell on deaf ears. They do not want to change the culture... people stick around because they haven't worked other places and think they can keep on floating along. They need new and fresh executive leadership and management to bring need ideas into a dying industry.

micro-managing 

the exuse being given for the lack of responsibility from management include

throwing employee into different roles or job responsibilities yet not compensating the amount of work/ input that is being demanded 

any constructive critisism (backed up with facts & solutions) is being met with 'this is just how it is'
Advice to Management
Management should be down to earth when it comes to the process & be very focused on their own tasks (protecting the team from BS coming from the other side of the contract) 

First things first - meaning that managemnt role is not to micro-manage and give constant feedbacks about whats been done or not been done but to focus on hearing the agent out and optimizing the process based on that info (the only valid one in the chaotic enviroment) 

Focus on specifying the tasks and job responsibilities rather than put one person responsible for everything & nothing

2021-06-17, Service Delivery Manager,"Łódź, Lódz, Lódz","Former Employee, more than 5 years",A place where racism and discrimination has a name written in bold,"The only good thing in Fujitsu is senior management in Japan,
","during my career working in many companies I never been humiliated but Fujitsu did. Having a company like fujitsu firibg those people who are giving the best to customers is absolutely insane. Many customers left fujitsu Poland and went to HCL, Infosys and other companies where maturity is better. In Fujitsu Poland this is how it works:

1- You get promoted if you have contacts with managers.
2- You work hard you stuck in your position until they promotd their friends then they give you rubbish position.
3- Due to corruption in giving position, this impacts on quality of work, imagine 5 people were promoted unlawfully and 1 bcz of his her performance, all thr workload goes to the one who is hard working, this employee will cover on their mistakes.
4- Those hard working people are being transferred too often to critical customers to clean the mess of the bad people. Once everything is stable, the credit goes to others and never recognise the work.

5- Dismissal of employees being done in illegal way, they never give reasons why they are ending contracts, if angone asks why their answer ""go to the court""
6- HR falsifying reports, every timr someone leaves the company HR asks him her about reasons, employees are leaving due to management and bad work environment later in the report they ask the employee to sign where it is written different reasons.
7- Many foreigners need the work permit to work, they refuse to give work permit. They fired many foreigners for no reasons.

8- Data leak, it happened so many times that secrets of customers were stolen and sold elsewhere, if customer is victim why no punishment was taken for those people?

9- Many security breaches in their devices, people used to watch footbal match in the office. MANY WEBSITES are not blocked, you can watch, access any website you want, including DarkWeb websites.
10- There is no placd for foreigners to work, every foreigner works with fears to get dismissed at any time.
11- Diversity and Inclusion has only a title but in reality is absent.

2021-05-08, Lead CAE Analyst,Tokyo,Current Employee,Struggling to keep up with the industry,"It is a former group company of one of the leading Japanese manufacturer, Fujitsu., Ltd. The company manufactures and sales a variety of components, allowing to appeal to a wide range of end-equipments and parts. As a company starting off with relay components, it has a strong connection and background to electricity and telecommunication companies in Japan as well as other electronic component companies. Owning their own factory, and designing their products by themselves, the company has a strong control over the products they manufacture, realizing provision of high quality.
","Entering their 20th anniversary, the company culture is starting to become outdated. While the company strives to make flexible moves and tries to change its strategic actions to adapt to the changing market of Japanese electronic component manufacturing, it is struggling to see its effects at the time being. The philosophy of all-the-way-to-the-end by designing in-house, manufacturing internally, and selling by themselves are resulting in high price which further burden them in competition in the market.

2021-04-28, Applications Developer,"Bracknell, England, England","Former Employee, more than 3 years","Old, white, male and stale - their words not mine!","Laidback.
Slow paced.
Lots of red tape and paperwork.
Little need to know what you're doing.
Lots of hype.
","Hypocritical stance on minority groups.
Low retention of minorities, because if they complain about the discrimination - the company gets rid of them.
If you mention the poor diversity it's a ""not our problem"" approach.
You can evidence harassment, bullying, discrimination or poor practice/standards and the company will straight up deny it then come after your job - then replace you with someone more expensive.
Overly-protective of the old-hats in the company, regardless of their competence or wrongdoing.
Patronising/Infantilizing culture.
Terrible graduate scheme.
Too much hype.
Advice to Management
Don't fire people that challenge your bad behaviour.
Don't try to pretend everything is the fault of one person so you can try to scapegoat your way out - it doesn't work.
Spend more on your employees and less on your legal team.
Stop replacing competent staff with consultants because they highlighted the glaring flaws and you didn't like it.
Don't treat people's job like you can hold it over them to get what you want.
Stop behaving like children on a playground and show some responsibility.

After spending 9+ years with Fujitsu, I find that Management has lost the spine to grow the business, they lack vision and competency. As on 2021, Fujitsu is more like a congregation of factional feudal groups headed by daimyos who report into the Shogun (aka Takahito Tokita). It is rife with internal politics which is detrimental to the careers of individual employees. If an individual does not have viable options in these tough times he/she may choose to join this organization just to stay afloat, but it not a viable option for the long term.
Advice to Management
Management claims to be customer centric.. You first need to be employee centric. You promote and retain individuals who have integrity issues and play the organizational politics.

","You work with out dated hardware, software and processes. It's a timewarp into the early 90s. It's just a big balleeks really. Everyone around you are thick. All your colleagues are alcoholics because they drink to numb the pain of throwing their lives away at Fujitsu. If you go into fujitsu with skills, you will come out deskilled. It's like you walk into a cave form the light... your eyes become desenstised to the darkness and your eyes adjust and all you see around you is faeces, then when you leave, you are practically blinded by the sun, squinting and fumbling around trying to find your feet again. Fujitsu is the pits, never go there - and if you are employed there - get out NOW!

Fujitsu is still highly regarded in Japan. Still a great place if you are into certain hardware development aspects.
","Japanese managers have a faint idea about how to do business outside of Japan. They also exhibit exceedingly hierarchical and political thinking. Usually marginal English skills don't help with staff communication - and there's very little of it in the first place. The regional subsidiaries all struggle with the move to the cloud and the shift from old school data centers to hyperscalers - with basically no differentiators. If you are into software development - do yourself a favour and keep your distance.

Great company with good benefits such health security. Fujitsu really cares about their employees, during the pandemic situation they focused to keep the employees working from home and nobody was put in lay off as several companies have done. They give you freedom to work and bring solutions and if you are focused in your career, you have great opportunies to learn new things and develop yourself.
Cons
None. I worked in other multinational compnaies and Fujitsu is the best of them!

2021-03-02,Anonymous,,Former Employee,Management are dinosaurs.,"One or two genuine people.
","The management are extremely set in their ways and will not allow for any changes or suggestions to the status quo. Most staff are too afraid to challenge this and those that do end up with a target on their backs. Favouritism is rife towards long standing staff and back-stabbing to get above colleagues is actively encouraged. Pay rises are virtually nonexistent and well below that of leading competitors in the same field.
Advice to Management
Listen to new ideas and learn to accept criticism presented to you. You will never change without accepting there are serious issues within this dated organisation model as it currently stands. Shake up the management and allow fresh ideas to grow instead of choosing to ignore staff who had ideas of how to help change the defeatist idealogy that most of your current employees have.

","* lead delivery times

* pushing for great margins but somehow always failing when it comes to the competition.
* Aprox 25% expensive than any competitors
* no real run rate business because no consumer products but mostly high end-at least outside the Japan
* most of the pretty products are not available outside the Japan.
* Agile phylosophy?...unfortunately everything is slow until it comes to kicking people out, yeah that one is very fast.
* Instead of all cons, Fujitsu is a great company to work and I ""still"" believe in Fujitsu. On the other hand you have no idea what may happen next week... month... year...things are not stable.
* who is ruling/managing the faith of Fujitsu? There are several faces...inside Japan & outside Japan...anything uotside the Japan is like a big puppet show which you will not enjoy to watch...
* Fujitsu Client Computing Limited (""FCCL"") ..perhaps that is the worst thing in the picture.

2021-02-19, IT Support,"Bracknell, England, England","Current Employee, more than 3 years",Awful,"A way of getting your foot in the door to work for a proper IT desk. We'll, it's suppose to be good for that
","Awful marking system that doesn't make moral or practical sense. You cannot use the toilet more than 30 minutes per month. Everyone can see your agent score, how often you've been using the toilet and you're constantly pressured to meet at least 95 percent on a scoring system that doesn't reflect at all on how professional you are or how we'll you are serving your customer. It's all based on how fast you can get the call finished and how many insidents you manage to close. (closing certainly does not mean solve) usually means you've managed to fob the user off. Progression isn't necessarily given to someone that will be a positive impact to the company. You'll notice that the ones progressing tend to go to the pub with each other and management tend to pick who they think will be a laugh to join their team. Once you aren't an agent you're in the position where you can pass pass responsibility on others and just smoke cigarettes and fart and pretend to look at emails from time to time. Agents are told to buddy up with other agents who are usually very stressed out and do t really need anyone listening to what they're doing and asking questions because they're stressed enough trying to do the job themselves with poor training. The building and everything in it doesn't get cleaned well and looks like it's never been cleaned at all. Agents have brought this to management so many times and usually get a sarcastic response and everyone is told to clean their desk themselves. Management are allowed to isolate every other week and come into office the other but if you're an agent you have to come in every day. The environment in the building I'm working at isnt prepared and made safe for workers during a pandemic. Equipment is broken or of very poor quality and is usually very disgusting. Most of the time there's someone that isn't even able to sit at a seat because the companys hired too many people and doesn't have enough seats or equipment for them. Agents suffer a lot of abuse from customers each day due to people higher up the chain not caring and forgetting to give crucial information and have awful guidance on how to manage situations. You're expected to refer to a knowledge base for any questions the customer might have or to help solve their issue. The information is quite often wrong though or ot updated and when the customer asks why you are left stressed and cannot tell the truth otherwise you could lose your job.

This is my honest experience of the floor I work on and the rest of the building seems a lot nicer and workers are respected more as human being should be.

More money needs to be spend and corners need to stop being cut. There needs to be an over all positive and can do attitude and not just reacting to things going wrong at the last second. The energy in the building is very draining and negative and there needs to be more effort in showing the benefit of working as a team and showing respect to each other. 

The pay is really bad considering what the job intels.
Advice to Management
Management need proper training and shouldn't be picked due to the fact they're more of a laugh than the guy that's worked hard and fits the criteria for the role but isn't picked because he isn't seen as ""cool"" or funny

2021-01-15, Project Manager,,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",Terrible Graduate Scheme,"The people who work there are mostly very friendly - I got on with the majority of my colleagues. There was also some work from home potential
","The graduate scheme is highly competitive and is constantly talked up in the company - however I had an awful time as did many in my cohort, many of whom left as soon as they could. I was given almost nothing to do, was regularly pitted against my peers, was patronised and treated like a child by many of the older men in SLT. The grad scheme element consisted mostly of 8, fairly useless learning modules that we attended over 2 years. Outside of that there was no support from the grad scheme team who were more interested in recruitment than retainment. Nobody checked in from the wider organisation to see how grads were fairing. Many of the grads who I knew suffered massively with mental health due to the poor support and opportunities provided. We were told by Business Unit leadership that we just needed to be more resilient. 
I personally was given very little work to do or responsibility - despite seeking it out regularly. Then was penalised for such in performance reviews.
Advice to Management
Actually listen to your graduates, check in on them. Focus some of the attention on actually supporting the cohort, rather than just recruiting.

2021-01-10, Domain Architect,"Basingstoke, England, England","Current Employee, less than 1 year","Seems like a great company to work for so far, great atmosphere and great opportunities","Having worked here for only 6 or 7 months, I've been working remotely (Covid) and have not actually met my colleagues in person yet. However I have still been accepted into the team and feel part of them. My opinions are valued and my voice is heard within my Project team. This also seems to be the case outside of the team though I haven't had much experience with this as of yet. My manager is very good at recommending training and opportunities. He is very good at breaking down the information disseminated from the higher ups which is good considering that it is a very large company. They are very flexible in working hours however it seems as though they will not be continuing significant WFH arrangements after covid. They on the whole do seem to value their workforce and want to look after it which is more than can be said for most SIs. There is a lot of talk around diversity and inclusion in the company which is great.
","While my manager is good at recommending training, I rarely seem to get any time to do it! The job is fast paced and there is little room for rest, let alone doing some training in the day. Their IT infrastructure is not the most up to date, many seem to be being given older laptops when the join, though I think I was a lucky one and got a new laptop. They could implement better in-company communication systems as Skype really does suck at the moment. (Why skype can't just keep a conversation string going day-to-day is beyond me!)
Advice to Management
Allow (especially at the moment with the pandemic) and encourage employees to take some time during the working week to do training. I understand that this can be done outside of work hours and many are happy doing that. I already end up working longer hours than I should for the project I am on and as such I end up having to do any training outside of those hours which means I rarely get a lot of meaningful training done!

The vast majority of people at Fujitsu are absolutely lovely and this is one of the main reasons I like working for them. You can achieve a good work life balance, and the pay is usually fair. The culture is excellent and Fujitsu truly believe in making the tech industry more sustainable and more accessible for less advantaged groups.
","General approach is a little less forward-thinking or ""edgy"" than other competitors in the tech space such as Apple, HP etc. But this is balanced out by their solid and reliable nature. There is a tendency for it to feel like the majority of employees to be old white men, but this is definitely changing.

","The worst experience I ever had in my career, foreigners are not welcomed to get higher even though their performance is the best. This is not the fault of the company by the management who seem not willing to deliver good service for their customers, reading in forums and listening webinars everyone speaking about diversity and inclusion, customer centric but in reality there is total discrimination and never keep customer fully satisfied which is silly strategy. 

I am a foreigner and I got fired without any notice even though I have timeless contract, I received the termination letter via email and I was simply shocked they claimed that I have performance issue while in my 4 years in FJ I was the top performer , when I mentioned this is unfair and there is a mistake somewhere, they asked me to go to court as I dont have the right to complaint. The maturity of HR is questionable as terminating contract of employee in this way is unprofessional.

In addition to all this, the salary is lower over 35% comparing to other companies in the same city - Lodz/Poland-, the salary of Service Desk Agent (1st line) in other companies is almost equal to salary of Team Manager in Fujitsu.

Covid19 approach: 
All employees were able to keep their jobs - remote-working from home has been deployed.
","General impression:
Dysfunctional and disorganized, leading to impracticable expectations. 

Training:
Poor training program, which only addresses introductory material but does not teach how to perform daily operations. Most of the training consists in watching a colleague without understanding what is happening. 

Systems & Tools:
Constantly failing. Circumstances do not reflect projected image, nor desired service quality standards. 

Employee evaluation:
Employee performance statistics are affected by issues beyond their control (lack of proper training and malfunctioning tools).

Leadership and Structure:
Too many procedures in relation to daily operations are unknown, unclear or lacking. Internal communication between collaborating inter-dependent teams is slow and often difficult (counterproductive).
Very cordial and respectful Managers, contrasting with authoritarian and unreasonable Team Leaders.

Does not take knee jerk reactions quarterly like some Indian IT companies. Tries to generally not lay off people unless absolutely necessary. Decent HR polices for lower designations.
","Lack of career progression for senior leadership, bigot European Caucasian coterie UK dominated leadership will now allow Indian talent to progress. Lack of technology focus and no serious investments in digital technologies. Primitive fragmented global org structure treating India location as low end sub-contractors. Leadership having no clue on how to compete outside Japan. If looking for any kind of customer facing roles - STAY AWAY. You will be subservient to europeans even in delivery roles. For any pre-sales or solution , architecture roles no learning, no customer exposure.
Advice to Management
Clean up Global Delivery leadership, get the UK coterie out of leadership positions. Get diversity in management and invest in India as a strategic location like how competition is doing. Treat Global delivery talent on par with western talent and not as second class employees. HR needs to focus on core function rather than upward management focus.

2020-08-13,Anonymous,"London, England, England","Former Employee, more than 10 years",Words not action,"There are still some good people, but perhaps few in the management chain. Fujitsu outside uk still holds its values and is honourable.
","Executives change strategy at the drop of hat.
Promises and assurances are dropped when convinient. Get everything in paper or its worth nothing.
They talk good values but spend more time chasing the awards rather than living them.
Despite their success claims, they rarely hit target, so dont expect a fair bonus, infact it seems to be setup to ensure you do not get to target payment.
Downsizing is their only response to failure. Do not get comfortable, you may end up on the annual list.
Execs seem immune to redundancy or in fact to removal through failure to hit targets. They just move the deckchairs as the ship sinks.
Advice to Management
If you hold your values, you would realise the problem sits with you. Move over for new management.

2020-07-21, Senior Engineer,"London, England, England","Current Employee, more than 1 year",An Absolute Boys Club,"There's potential there, but it constantly falls flat.
","Work and promotions are given by favour, not by ability, skill, or past experiences. If you're loud, pushy, and steal others' work, you'll be noticed. If you're a white guy, you'll always be given a seat at the table (even if others ""outrank"" them). You'll be welcomed by superiors to join their ranks regardless of your actual output. If you're a woman or a person of color, you'll have to work twice as hard to get noticed half as much. There are managers there that will openly tell you they care about their personal reputation first, far past their own team. I have heard managers (that were being recorded) yell and scream to get their way when what they wanted was going to hurt their customers (and did!). If you try to put the customer first, they will silence you, dismiss you, and talk over you to get their way. 

They encourage this behavior by continually rewarding these blokes and giving them more responsibility. Sales is set up against each other so departments are fighting over the same work without the customer's best interest in mind. The work silos prevent new work from ever coming in and wastes so much effort. A lot of talent working there now is just waiting to be offered the right opportunity to leave but COVID messed everything up. Still looking.
Advice to Management
It's great to talk about diversity, but there's so many departments that have absolutely none. It should be natural, not a token seat at the table to pretend to be heard (but at this point, even a token seat would be a step up). We get asked for our thoughts and the mangement teams run away with them. They'll get the bonus while you get the crumbs and a stalled career. Go team.

Advice to Management
Weak management with no spine to stand up for employees and the NZ branch is technically been given over to Fujitsu Australia, Fuj NZ makes a profit, but Fuj Aus does not, but they siphon the funds from Fuj NZ and pay Fuj Aus staff handsomely but do not do any better, this company disregards those who are actually making money for them.

There are some good mid level staff members and it is interesting work that exposes you to different environments of the clients and alternate approaches to a single problem. But this is not due to some inherent virtue of the company.

The $61,000 compensation for a System Engineer is nonsense for a full time employee, only contractors who do half the work and have a quarter of the knowledge get that. There has been no pay rise for the past 2 years, though Fujitsu made a profit for the 2019 FY they still are not giving out any pay rises, so this is a on going issue.

There is also rampant cronyism and gate-keeping of knowledge by many of the staff as they seem to value their own jobs over any semblance of team work.

One of the worst places for getting a good paying job.

","Management of the project where i worked was very pathetic, Knowledge transfer was not documented, verbally done. Management didnt have an understanding on the effort required to deliver the work, proper work load distribution was not done ie One team member will work for longer periods while other team members spent all time leisurely , management didnt observe or care for this. Too much pressure to deliver work within very short period of time, blame game was done and team members never got due credit for any work you do. You would get hire for the skills you posses but you will end up working on excel sheets.

","I worked for Fujitsu for over 8 years. The wages are very poor. Pay rises even if you get one have were always well below inflation. Over time Fujitsu have taken away employee benefits. As two examples only a portion of the bank holidays are now available, the medical benefit now has to be paid for. Fujitsu only seem concerned that you comply with what they want and have no concern about their employees moral. They expect more and more from employees without any financial compensation. I always felt stressed that I had to watch my back constantly because of the back stabbing by management and other teams, this was awful. The senior management are just the worst and have no concern regarding the people that work below them. This includes their own managers below them. The last straw came when the mamagement began taking away overtime that I relied on because of the poor wages. I suspect however, that was due to the fact I stood up for myself. So word of warning, DO NOT stand up to the management. You will be punished for it.

Advice to Management
Resign.

When you take in driven, motivated people who are interested in doing good work and place them in an environment where they have to deal with colleagues and supervisors gossiping about their personal life and badmouthing them behind their backs, morale is sure to suffer. 

Add to that the fact that career progression seems to often be held back by office politics and that higher management would rather often hire someone from outside than give an active employee the opportunity to climb up and you have a recipe for disaster, especially considering that other companies offer considerably higher salaries for the same kind of work. People might be willing to work an entry level job for comparatively less as long as they feel there is the possibility of progression, but when they keep getting shut down by biased parties despite delivering consistently good performance, then they will be sure to start looking for other alternatives. 

It does not help that people are too often selected for promotion based not on competence but on who they are friends with, or simply on nationality. Career progression is nearly impossible for foreigners in many departments. More competent candidates are consistently harmed either by not being given the dates of the assessments with enough time in advance to prepare for them, or having those assessments scheduled right after strenuous work, with no time to rest beforehand.

Other than the fact that a considerable amount of supporting and management staff enjoy gossip and interfering other people's personal life, there are also inappropriate and downright criminal behaviors taking place at some departments, such as xenophobic attitudes (both from customers and from Fujitsu staff), inappropriate conversations being held in the workplace in front of everyone and sexual harassment, all of which have been reported to management and HR and are consistently ignored. 
Supervisors and managers in some departments are also known for ignoring and mistreating foreigners - from consistently trying to deny them opportunities for advancement to giving them the worst shifts or trying to force them to constantly change scheduling arrangements for the benefit of the local favorites, or even screaming loudly at them in the middle of the workplace and using demeaning language. 

Never before in my life have I seen people behaving this way in the workplace, especially at a multinational company. There are also cases where supervisors try to force first line agents to work seven days in a row or ignore the mandatory rest times between shifts as per Polish labor law. Other times, employees who refuse this inappropriate treatment are singled out for retaliation, mobbing, harassment and false disciplinary claims in an attempt to intimidate them. The Fujitsu Way is Omerta.

It is nearly impossible for bad employees to get fired, and they are often promoted as a way of getting rid of them. Competent and committed employees are frequently ignored. Several projects have people in positions of responsibility who want to do the bare minimum and treat people actually interested in working with disdain and hostility. As long as the service level agreements are met and the customers are happy, no action is taken.

Equipment is frequently shoddy, badly maintained and there is an absolute lack of interest by many supervisors in providing tools and access rights that are required for basic daily tasks. It can take months for simple repairs to be performed since the onsite technicians are chronically understaffed and don't care at all. Some internal resolver groups are known for ignoring high priority service disruptions for days on end.

In the same vein, the HR department is frankly dishonest and incompetent, often taking an eternity to update employee data, misplacing important documents or not filing them at all, especially when dealing with visas and recruitment initiatives where an existing employee is supposedly eligible for a bonus by introducing a new potential recruit.

Repor","Resign.

When you take in driven, motivated people who are interested in doing good work and place them in an environment where they have to deal with colleagues and supervisors gossiping about their personal life and badmouthing them behind their backs, morale is sure to suffer. 

Add to that the fact that career progression seems to often be held back by office politics and that higher management would rather often hire someone from outside than give an active employee the opportunity to climb up and you have a recipe for disaster, especially considering that other companies offer considerably higher salaries for the same kind of work. People might be willing to work an entry level job for comparatively less as long as they feel there is the possibility of progression, but when they keep getting shut down by biased parties despite delivering consistently good performance, then they will be sure to start looking for other alternatives. 

It does not help that people are too often selected for promotion based not on competence but on who they are friends with, or simply on nationality. Career progression is nearly impossible for foreigners in many departments. More competent candidates are consistently harmed either by not being given the dates of the assessments with enough time in advance to prepare for them, or having those assessments scheduled right after strenuous work, with no time to rest beforehand.

Other than the fact that a considerable amount of supporting and management staff enjoy gossip and interfering other people's personal life, there are also inappropriate and downright criminal behaviors taking place at some departments, such as xenophobic attitudes (both from customers and from Fujitsu staff), inappropriate conversations being held in the workplace in front of everyone and sexual harassment, all of which have been reported to management and HR and are consistently ignored. 
Supervisors and managers in some departments are also known for ignoring and mistreating foreigners - from consistently trying to deny them opportunities for advancement to giving them the worst shifts or trying to force them to constantly change scheduling arrangements for the benefit of the local favorites, or even screaming loudly at them in the middle of the workplace and using demeaning language. 

Never before in my life have I seen people behaving this way in the workplace, especially at a multinational company. There are also cases where supervisors try to force first line agents to work seven days in a row or ignore the mandatory rest times between shifts as per Polish labor law. Other times, employees who refuse this inappropriate treatment are singled out for retaliation, mobbing, harassment and false disciplinary claims in an attempt to intimidate them. The Fujitsu Way is Omerta.

It is nearly impossible for bad employees to get fired, and they are often promoted as a way of getting rid of them. Competent and committed employees are frequently ignored. Several projects have people in positions of responsibility who want to do the bare minimum and treat people actually interested in working with disdain and hostility. As long as the service level agreements are met and the customers are happy, no action is taken.

Equipment is frequently shoddy, badly maintained and there is an absolute lack of interest by many supervisors in providing tools and access rights that are required for basic daily tasks. It can take months for simple repairs to be performed since the onsite technicians are chronically understaffed and don't care at all. Some internal resolver groups are known for ignoring high priority service disruptions for days on end.

In the same vein, the HR department is frankly dishonest and incompetent, often taking an eternity to update employee data, misplacing important documents or not filing them at all, especially when dealing with visas and recruitment initiatives where an existing employee is supposedly eligible for a bonus by introducing a new potential recruit. Anyone reporting instances of inappropriate behavior to HR also only end up making themselves a target for further retaliation or being completely ignored.

All of these issues were previously reported and no action was taken. One other employee who was the victim of sexual harassment was not only ignored for months but also basically told something along the lines of ""we spoke to the person and it only happened once, so what's the problem?"" This is patently false as the perpetrator has done this to several people. Not only has this criminal kept their job but they were actually rewarded with a promotion.

2019-11-28, Second Line Analyst,,Current Employee,A slow death,"Because, to be fair, they do exist:

Buy up to 10 days additional leave at a set monthly cost.
Company will pay 10% pension beyond a certain point.
Flexi time and ability to work from home regularly depending on where you are and what department – not guaranteed however.
Job security – its pretty hard to get fired from this place, unless you're a complete idiot.
","Buckle up:

Pays below standard equivalent salary. 

Expects you to essentially do two (probably more) jobs for the price of one – while paying below equivalent salary.

Expects you to be “dedicated” (ie start early/finish late outside of your contracted hours) – will not openly criticise but the undercurrent is there –while paying below equivalent salary. Basically expecting you to treat it like a 40 grand job – here's a hint: it ain't.

Introduces annoying, inconvenient process changes that increase your workload so some guy upstairs can get a bonus – while you get a below equivalent salary. And probably no bonus either.

People who are someone’s third cousin’s daughter or nephew get fast-tracked into higher paying roles despite being technically oblivious – while you get paid below equivalent salary. (You can progress if you apply yourself but be prepared to fight for it unless your “face fits” or nepotism is on your side).

Rubbish internal IT and infrastructure – not helped by your below equivalent salary.

Silo’d work environment will make you feel constrained and like you’re not really learning anything (or even have a “career”, really) until you become institutionalised and stuck in a box – while being paid below equivalent salary – but by that point you’ll have had the drive to achieve and go elsewhere sucked out of you by soul-crushing make-work monotony – and be stuck with your below equivalent salary.

Promises to do something about the below equivalent salary – including employee surveys, “action plans” and pay reviews – which, over a year later, amount to nothing more than…you guessed it.

I still wonder, who hired this guy who is the most unprofessional person I met in corporate. First of all, he takes everything personally, always doubts people, makes random allegations. If a person by mistake comes on his radar, this manager makes that person leave the company by harassment, threatening and targetting. Lot of people have complained against this guy but hr team acts as per the directions of delivery team so no point in seeking their help. This manager is a perfect example of office politics, bias ness and mostly abuse of his power. He always promotes those who are goodie goodie with him. I have personally experienced his wrath just because he felt I was conspiring against him. I really felt bad while learning this company because the client was very supportive and motivated me. It always surprised me that how come this guy is allowed to ruin people's career who join this great company for chasing their dream. To add more, this guy is given more bigger role. What

Pros
Worked at Fujitsu for 13 years starting first at Fujitsu Siemens and then merged into Fujitsu. Was difficult at times to find training opportunities whilst in first role I had at Fujitsu. 

Most recent role at Fujitsu was able to get some good training opportunities, would like to have done more was probably just my laziness!
Cons
I was made redundant from my role at Fujitsu which I appreciate companies need to do sometimes but I was not happy with the way they handled it which was disappointing considering this is a large company who has done this a few times you'd think they'd learn.

We had a scoring process which was delayed but my exit date was not put back as a result of this sort I had quite short notice from being told I was selected to when I left. Also the company were saying that they were helping to find redeployment opportunities for you which they weren't really, they were simply advertising roles to us and providing other resources to help with this.

They did however, provide training for help with looking for work in the future such as CV workshops, Linkedin workshops and Interview workshops.

Also whilst in my previous role had been trying to get my job grade increased but always told by managers that they're pursuing HR to get it done and anything else which required HR involvement never got done. Seemed like HR ran the company instead of senior management.

- Working in Portugal is always a plus, a great country to live in
- Health insurance - although it is not so great, but it is among the better ones offered by companies in the local market

- HR system in Fujitsu Portugal is a big low point. They only focus on recruitment activities.
- Facilities in Braga site are, the nicest to say, too humble for the size of the company and the number of headcounts working there. Disgrace for a tech company!
That includes no parking lots, no enough dining areas, the number of bathrooms is just fit (if one goes into maintenance, it is a complete disaster), new hires always trigger the question to us: where are they going to have their seats, and the list goes on...

2019-07-09, Senior Systems Engineer,Melbourne,"Former Employee, more than 5 years","Where to begin, Insane management who don’t have a clue what is happening to there business","Usually paid at least one a month
","No work/life balance: not sure why other people say it has a good work life balance. My experience is that they expect you to do on-call once a month, do patching and application releases overnight or on weekends (often with only minimal notice) as well as be able to answer the phone when not on-call, just in case. All the while, expecting you to study for exams to get certifications which you will never use because they are so far behind.
Low pay: Most of the base pay is below industry standards, most pay rises were about 1% per year, the last 2 years there were no pay rises, and Management justified it because they lost too many contracts. So the workers end up suffering because the management can't keep the current clients.. 
Annual Leave: In the past few years, because they are losing money, they started to force people to take annual leave, First it was you have to take 20 days per financial year, then it was that you can't have a balance over 8 at the end of the financial year, the next year, it was down to a balance of 7.
This cause you to take annual leave mostly in the final month of the financial year (March cause it is a Japanese company) which is also quiet a busy time, which means staff are missing at important time.
Redundancies: Over the past 4 years, they have been making staff redundancy at regular intervals. Firstly it was one a year (usually around June/July) but since then, they have been making people redundancy in small lots (1-2 a week) this mean moral is rock bottom, and most staff don't know what is happening when they come to work on a Monday.

2019-07-08, Senior Systems Engineer,,"Former Employee, more than 5 years",Good company in general,"in general it is a well established company with creative and professional people in several areas which is very useful to build and develop your skills

you will have the opportunity to work in interesting projects and with large scale customers

benefits are vary depend on the country and the department

personal development depends on the customer need, but generally fujitsu has several partnerships with other vendors which can provide special trainings
","with such large scale company it's hard to deliver your voice or ideas to higher management

You don't feel of it as a one company when it comes to deal or cooperate with teams in another country, fujitsu in each country has it's own rules and system

depend on the country and the department, some may have unclear vision and lack of honesty with their employees

in some countries you will find teams separated by technology which will lock your career to a specific technology/area only and it's hard to get out of it

Pros
Pros:
They will keep you for 2 to 3 months bench. Since they don't have project, so you can enjoy.

Cons:
Project will not come. So finally they will remove the resource saying no Project.
The guys in Bench will be 8 to 10 years experience. He/she will have no option to overcome this situation and to join the other company as well. Worst Scenario for Experience guys to come inside this organisation. Don't believe with their Package. 

Don't trust FCI, they are very slow in getting Projects. Only resources they are filling with no projects to show the head counts for each locations. Many are absconding. Not sure how Labour Law they following. 

Again warning all the experience candidates, Don't take risk. Even College students are not attending interview.

Advice to Management:
Give the bench guys training on Technology you have project. 
Check 6 months to allocate them into project.
No one expect good appraisal, but need good project.
Cons
I will negative on this as well, Resource Manager at Fujitsu think they are the top heavy. No big task for them still they sit like a boss. Think as if they are more than CEO.

They wont treat bench people properly. No Proper response from them. No formal communication to employees. HR from Work force department is really worst experience. 

Even those jobs can be given to Bench Guys they will handle it very well than those HR's who are simply sitting and getting.
Advice to Management
Management should take candidate oly when project is there. Simply taking each and everyone then removing as such will tossed up. Employees forward such events legally. Get the penalty from the firm and get the Justice.

Employee should be handled with Dignity, work force team in india are rude. Higher management please do question them.

Employees who are in bench should be used in some or the other project rather than sitting idle.

Advice to Management
I think it's fairly obvious to everyone working there that you make a lot of ""promises"" (most of them implied, nothing in writing of course) to get talented people to come on board but once they are there, the company will always find a way to not own up to them. 

Some examples:

-Strong work from home policy emphasized when I got hired but it was very rarely approved unless there were extenuating circumstances. The only logic I ever got was that it might look bad if the client came on-site and people were working from home...then why mention it in the first place?

-Emphasized the bonus program when I first got hired...I can't remember the last time anyone actually got a bonus though. They would always address this by saying certain metrics weren't met in other regions and since all regions are tied together, our region wouldn't get the bonus. Very frustrating considering you as an individual or team could exceed your targets for the year and not get recognized for it...

Minimal supervision of work, trusted to get on with it.
","Psychotic bad tempered managers - this is no exaggeration. I was screamed at more than once for minor transgressions, such as being 5 mins late, while others in the team got away with much more. This is blatant victimisation.

Also experienced direct side-lining. Forced to do nothing for months while team I was supposed to be a part of were extremely busy.

Cronyism rife - frequently saw other less experienced colleagues promoted to more senior tech. positions/ management, because they were in favour. 

Over reliance on contractors, to the detriment of permanent staff. Contractors were frequently hired to do work that others, with little to do could do with ease/ minimal handover or training. This appeared to be cronyism again.

Lack of promotional/ developmental opportunities for those not part of the in-crowd. 


Wage rises small and infrequent. 

Staff performance appraisals seem to be paper ticking exercises. Management did not use these to seriously develop/ progress staff, in my experience. The get-out clause for them seems to be ""your development is your responsibility"". However if blocked from training or promotion to more interesting teams, while seeing colleagues routinely moved between teams to fill new positions, or promoted to new positions, which were never advertised, this feels extremely unfair.
Advice to Management

The company intentions are good but the company needs to urgently invest in its core staff and build lean high performance teams with less overhead. The focus should be on supporting front line staff not corporate compliance and cost control. Significant time is wasted grappling with systems ironcally intended to save money.

Get a grip and stop fiddling while Rome burns. 

EMEIA is in disarray and all you do is leave it those below you to select the latest 'whipping boys' (and girls) to take the fall f Cutting costs in back office functions is NOT going to save you.

You are chipping away at the iceberg you're standing on and are running out of room so STOP looking to those below you to take the fall and have the guts to take accountability for a weak, ineffective strategy. 

If our clients really knew what is going on internally then I truly believe we would win even less business.

Listen to your disruptors or risk becoming the next Nokia.

When an organization isn’t set up to create effective communications within departments or doesn’t foster creative strategic management, you can miss opportunities, allow problems to continue and reduce employee morale. When employees aren’t happy, they might not volunteer new ideas or might leave for a better job. Poor organizational structure can lead to a reduction in productivity, decreasing your growth potential.

","Lots of cons. 
1. Less pay and in everything,company is doing cost cutting. Shift allowance is very less.if you want that employee should work good you should focus on employee perspective.
2. Manager is very unprofessional and rude. Only they wants to put their own thoughts and do not want to listen and understand the things. Its very difficult to work with manager.
3. For New joiner there are not good gesture and no one will talk to you, you have to talk and understand. I think there must be some policies for new joiners.
4. Work is good but lots of process is involved. We can understand about the data confidentiality. But lots of process effect technical growth.
5. Management is not good. No appreciation will receive only escalations are coming ..
6. Transport facility is worst. As office location. Is very far from city. Transport facility for shifts should be home pickup . And transport facility should be free for shift.

Rear guard action from older staff who were unwilling to share or learn technology or contribute further to the business and we're just waiting for retirement in some cases. Company unwilling or unable to make them redundant.
The business is not a meritocracy and pay rises are scale-limited even after promotion, younger and keener engineers who started from apprenticeships or service desk are forced out of the business due to the stagnation and lack of payrises (or their contracts make it easier to get rid of the them), as well as the rapid staff cuts during outsourcing to try and remain competitive with other more-agile companies.

Some colleagues are very nice
","Massive bureaucracy, management changes quickly and new management typically thinks too highly of their skills. Awfully bad HR, can't even deliver simple employment certificate to right address and don't reply sent emails on time and sometimes just don't reply at all.
Others:
- shortage of employees
- people are constantly leaving
- you literally have to fight for your rights to keep holiday 
- the management don't understand your job
- the management tries to suck everything out you and your energy
- the management don't take actions to fix the issues
- many the dos and don'ts
- hard work pace
- appreciation is dishonest, after ""praising"" always asks to do more and points to real level what they're targeting
- they can ask you to change your work hours dramatically
- low respect sacrifices what employees do
- little training compared to that what they will ask you to do, may times it's impossible to do what they asks without instructions
- Process Controllers interrupts you with their demands all the time and sometimes acts like mean girls

2018-12-12, Graduate Software Developer,,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",It is what you make of it,"The graduate programme features excellent training for soft skills, and the graduate community as a whole is well looked after with opportunities to get involved in numerous activities outside of your role.
","Although there are opportunities to get involved outside of your role, often it's the day job that is the shortcoming of this scheme. Some graduates have been underwhelmed with the roles they were assigned, and although there is the flexibility to rotate (although this is very much down to the individual to initiate), often this doesn't make up for the lack of fulfilling work. I also get the feeling this company doesn't operate as a meritocracy, but instead favours the employees who can shout the loudest.
Advice to Management
Be prepared to have roles ready for graduates upon their arrival. Often graduates are left with little to do early on, in some cases for a serious amount of time. This can be off-putting very early on.

2018-08-28, Manager,"London, England, England","Current Employee, more than 10 years",I'm a woman so.....,"Working from home option.
Salary sacrifice options so beneficial taxwise.
Large enough to move around and try new roles.
","Where to start...
Pay is diabolical, especially so being a woman as I'm paid less than my male peers, but nobody wants to acknowledge that, obviously.
Been through the redundancy cull multiple times in my career with Fujitsu, so it's a common occurrence leaving staff wondering where the axe will fall next. Re-orgs are mainly to blame for said culls, and Fujitsu does love a re-org. Also the redundancy process is an absolute farce and badly managed every time.
No transparency (or logic) re salaries for each grade so if applying for a new internal position you have no idea what the pay range is, and finding out is a challenge to say the least.
Female ratio low (20% at last count I believe).
Old boys network is rife in terms of redundancies (they avoid it) and progression (they make it).
Very old fashioned outlook ie lacks agility. Any new ideas are slow to be realised and by the time they are it's too late as we're over the curve.
Pay rises virtually non-existent and best way to get one is to leave and come back.
Japan is now wanting to regionalise again, yet globalisation is key to success. But hey, it must be time for yet ANOTHER re-org so why not!?!
Advice to Management
Treat your females more fairly as, believe it or not, we're just as talented as the men so deserve equal pay. 
As we go through yet another cull, push aside old boy network loyalties and keep the RIGHT people instead of the senior team's mates.
Take innovation and run with it....don't stifle the good ideas from your people and bury it in bureaucracy....instead get the Labs working on it, getting ideas to market ASAP.
Now is the time to look forward, not backward, if you want Fujitsu to survive.

2018-07-31, Business Development Representative,"Dallas, TX","Current Employee, more than 1 year",Fujitsu - FCPA,"Fujitsu FCPA was overall a great company to work for. They have a set number of dollars they can give you for a base salary but have other things to offer like car allowance. They want to make sure you feel well compensated for your role. They also provide a stipend for gym/club memberships which adds to your overall well being and helps decrease stress. I worked remote which is always a nice setup. I traveled extensively for my role, which came at no surprise since they were very transparent during the interview process.
","Being a remote employee I felt it was difficult to show my worth when I was not on a team that directly generated revenue or had a way to track ROI of our efforts. It was difficult to build internal relationship as we were very siloed. There also was no upward mobility due to the small size of the BU I worked in. Although if you may be interested in a career change they do encourage lateral changes so starting out in one role may lead you to a whole different role. Working at Fujitsu was a great opportunity to sharpen my people and account management skills as well as indirectly work in many different industries. If I could do it all again I would have taken more initiative to get on a call with my different colleagues, including my boss, one on one at least once a week to see how we can work together to advance internal initiatives. I would have also put more effort into changing their overall strategy for our team as It very clearly was not working.
Advice to Management
The strategy of convincing potential partners to commit most of, if not all of, the resources to complete a project initiated by Fujitsu is going to slow the growth of the partner network rendering the partner network strategy ineffective. Owning the cost and resources for a project would allow you to onramp more partners. Then you can work with the partner marketing team to go to market transfering residual marketing costs to the new partner.

2018-07-24,Anonymous,"Manchester, England, England","Former Employee, more than 8 years",Toxic,"Genuinely don't think any exist any more. I had to give the Company 1 star overall rating because it wouldn't let me submit it otherwise
","I felt there was strong evidence of repeated breaches of Fujitsu's Bullying Harrassment & Victimisation guidelines, specifically setting impossible objectives, deliberate wrong apportionment of blame, blocking training without business justification & insistence their way was the right way. This culminated when I had to send a 6am text to my manager from the hospital after a close family member was rushed in during the night for life-saving brain surgery and I returned to work to be placed on a Performance Improvement Plan, despite not taking any time off sick during the 8 years I worked there.

I queried with Manager 1 why you would use a family member's brain surgery for this and was told that wasn't what happened because ""the PIP doesn't say anything brain surgery. It says family emergency and it was a family emergency"".
I entered it in the feedback form for Manager 2's appraisal with Manager 3, but got no response from either of them
I queried it with Manager 4 who told me he couldn't give an answer because he was 52
I entered the comments in the Employee Opinion Survey but got no response from anybody
I queried with Manager 5 (who wasn't a manager at the time of the incident) and was told ""That was before I was the manager. I don't know what happened and I don't want to know. I don't care""
Finally after I had a leaving date I contacted Manager 3 again asking for a 1-2-1 to try and get an explanation for what happened which she initially agreed to but, upon learning what I wanted to discuss, she cancelled the meeting stating no good would come of it
Advice to Management
I would have thought you would want to keep your best members of staff and prior to any of this happening I had exceeded all of my objectives for 4 consecutive years so I don't understand why you think this behaviour is beneficial to the business.
If things have reached a point where an employee feels the need to report bullying, they should at least be entitled to have a manager ask to see the evidence and then later an explanation of ""Yes, that's what happened. Here's why..."" or ""No, that's not what happened. Here's what happened..."" For all I know, my experiences may not be classed as bullying, but for 6 different managers to refuse to even investigate it is unacceptable.

","Some truly terrible employees work here.
Management is dire in some instances.
Back biting, politics etc are rife and create a very bad working enviroment.

Redundancies.

- was given onsite opportunity
- was given fair appraisal
","- dictatorship at lead level and project management level , inefficient management practices
- no recognition and rewards to supportive technical consultant thereby they are reluctant to continue
- management want hardworking and high performing employees to quit from organization as they are afraid of there growth and client interaction after sometime
- random people are put on top of functional consultant for requirement gathering in order to irritate and make functional consultant inferior
Advice to Management
- Hire good sap managers who were themselves consultant in there career
- managers should be held accountable if employees leave the team or project
- avoid using gangster practice at project lead level , this only brings morale down and discourages you to continue for long time

The ground reality is that they are running a big Show with NO EXPERIENCE in that stream. They are doing a very big project but they are not expertise in it.
","Management is monotonous.
They do not listen for employees.
Solution they are selling to customer is questionable as they are not Capability Matured in it like Wipro, TCS or any other integration company.
Management is based in UK and they are highly racist. 
They have dummy HR processes like PIR or etc, which they use to fire a candidate with a very no cause. 
Be very much cautious in communication with management as they even read read word by word and they fire even on SPELLINGS and GRAMMATICAL MISTAKES. 

No Industry experience in running Big projects.
Not a Public listed reputed company.
They don't bother their reputation as they are not a public entity.
Simply a WASTE of TIME and CAREER.

2018-07-03, Technical Support Engineer,Bangalore,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",Avoid Fujitsu India: Not a place for someone with career aspirations and decent educational background,"The company has a strong brand presence and market recognition in Japan.
","MANAGEMENT/LEADERSHIP: Clearly the most political and unprofessional people on job who have made a mockery of corporate culture. They have Select favorites and have been made larger than the organization and are promoted at all costs, their professional competency notwithstanding. 
CULTURE: Un-collaborative, un-meritocratic culture. The moment you question your bosses, which is easy given the level of their professional competency, expect to be ostracized on all fronts. It is really a shame and such a culture is being promoted. These facts are unknown to Japan Management.
Purely Marathi Local Company Culture and worst than a startup.
Uneducated and unqualified Managers will lead the show.
People with good academic background and certifications will get huge surprises and shocks because of unethical and uneducated leadership team and managers.
WORK: Very ill managed, even if there is not much work you can end up spending hours in office for LAMS. This is more a systemic flaw - the management encourages the unprofessional-ism /incompetency of certain important people only. Purely partiality based appraisal system.
Advice to Management
India leadership - Very Sad to experience your rudeness, arrogance and basic lack of respect for individuals apart from local Maharashtraian guys or people who can speak Marathi which is official language of this company.
Japan Leadership - They doesn't know what is happening in India and to encourage offshoring, they are providing funds and here India team is recruiting people and keeping them on bench for years together and charging Japan Fujitsu without any output.

2018-06-20,Anonymous,"Richardson, TX","Current Employee, more than 5 years",Wonderful people but poor culture....to unstable,"Fujitsu has lots of pros in regards to technology and future possibilities! I’ve worked full-time for 5 years. Wonderful co-workers and mid level management. Great work life balance. The first 3 years many of us developed fantastic careers and thrived. The culture was about developing and sustaining good talent. Managers mentored and engaged their employees.
","The past 2 years significant changes and people passing the buck on failures has created major issues within the company. Loss of business being the main issue. Employees who once thrived either lost their jobs or terrified they are next. Cutting staff and good people for management failures is not good culture. Zero communication. And the feeling you are no longer valued after years of dedication. This isn’t dead weight. These are people working multiple jobs to help keep the train on the tracks. Now too many people are stretched way too thin.
Advice to Management
Stop making knee jerk reactions. Plan more. Engage with the people who help build a positive work environment, who are dedicated and want to see Fujitsu succeed. Hold Sales Teams accountable. Follow through on current initiatives! DO NOT KEEP CUTTING BUDGETS TO NOTHING. And STOP laying off employees that do the necessary work to enable success. Get rid of under performers. I 100% believe that if they can get past this rebuilding phase and stay focus on their initiatives, Fujitsu will go on a huge upswing. But they must stay focused and remember the little guys and show appreciation! The everyday employees are super dedicated and are willing to tackle any challenge. Truly the employees make this company a great place to work! Now Upper Management needs to understand this!

","Constant churn of reorg after reorg after reorg. 
Too much time spent navel-gazing and not enough time spent taking care of customers. 
Unrealistic budget goals and ruthlessly cutting of teams to achieve them. Short-sighted management of current resources.
Healthcare plan is the worst I have ever seen - all are forced into HRA or HSA; HRA amounts provided are fine for young, healthy people who never see a doctor but ridiculous for anyone else AND they make you jump through hoops even to get all of the amount they agree to provide. Up-front amount decreases and deductible increases every year.
No raises, no bonuses - no sense at all that upper management sees resources as anything other than expendable, disposable, and interchangeable.

Thanks again for sharing","Why don’t you do some market research and try to be more competitive? You guys will lose great talents just because of your below average services to your employees. You expect us to perform but you don’t know how to take care of us. I should’ve heed to my friends’ advice to stay away from this company.

2018-06-04,Anonymous,"Bracknell, England, England","Current Employee, more than 10 years",Seems to be on a slow decline,"Some really great, hard working people who go way beyond the call of duty. Flexible working. Some good benefits. Varied and interesting work. Frequent opportunities to gain experience and take on more responsibility.
","Poor pay, sub inflation pay rises every year and pay reviews delayed frequently. Always behind the curve. Not agile enough. Rare opportunities for progression. Taking on more responsibiity is rarely rewarded with addtional pay. Annual review system is a futile exercise for the majority. Re-orgs are too frequent. Pitiful training budget.
Advice to Management
You need to get a grip of reward to continue to motivate people. Stop following competitors and start to offer something different. Understand the real costs of near/offshoring. Stop re-organising so frequently.

2018-05-20, Service Desk Agent,Lisbon,"Former Employee, less than 1 year",Customer Support In Corporate Mediocrity,"Very few decent, talented and enjoyable colleagues. A pleasure to work with them.

No other pros.
","Working with outdated systems and tools in an IT/Tech company.... And on top of that, lackluster training and information provided by supervisors.
When things go wrong and stressful situations appear, employees who have no ressources or permission to solve issues are often blamed (lack of manager leadership? I sure think so). Many obstacles from the very start to perform your responsibilities correctly.

Tasks are repetitive and menial 95% of the time. You will be bored after 2 weeks unless you enjoy tedious unmotivating work. 

Salary is a joke. Absolutely not proportional to Lisbon life-cost. Benefits more of the same.

Career development is bleak. As in many places, it mostly depends on relation with managers and having ""friends"" in higher positions.
So your talent is not relevant and your work will not be useful for future opportunities elsewhere. A dead end unless you linger in mediocrity within the corporation.

HR are among the most incompetent people I had displeasure to deal with. Do not answer emails, do not update info, extremely slow, etc.... Your typical HR, no surprise but always a massive con.

No real incentive to stay.
Advice to Management
Recruit people according to the job's requirements. Do not recruit qualified and/or talented people to do tedious irrelevant tasks. Explain new recruits the full scope of their banal job so they understand from the start what to expect.

Get managers who understand the concept of managing a team.

2018-05-18, Technical Architect,Brisbane,"Former Employee, more than 10 years",Good to get experience then get out,"Potential for good salary; good chance for easy promotion if you love playing corporate politics; relatively easy to get promoted into position without relevant skills or experience. Good marketing and strong graduate hiring program. Management have good understanding of current technology trends.
","Micro managing Australian CEO with a history of poor results but still allowed to run company into the ground after many years; Japanese senior management allow the rot to continue. Huge influx of inexperienced graduates lack any decent mentorship within the company, it is like “blind leading the blind”; experienced people leaving in droves, increases pressure on those left behind. Management keen to respond to glass door online reviews but missing in action when providing feedback internally. Offshoring more and more roles, but most are very low quality offshore teams, continually creating issues that need locals to fix up. Low morale. Depressing work place. Actual delivery capabilities don’t match all the marketing hype. Unable to transform understanding of technology trends into real world applications and successful implementations that go beyond POCs. Does not practice what it preaches - internal IT environment not remotely close to solutions recommended for customers.

2018-05-03, Engineer,Singapore,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",Fujitsu Asia (Singapore) Review,"- Fun and loving colleagues who are there to support and encourage you.
- Knowledgeable seniors who mentor and guide.
- High Tolerant company.
","-It is disappointing to learn that despite being an IT company, there is not much automation nor is there a willingness to upgrade or change the process. Most of the internal processes that existed 10 years ago are still being applied today. Papers are being printed repeatedly for every single orders. Therefore, leading to a huge wastage of papers and resources to handle a dinosaur age company. 

-The Finance department staff are poorly trained and the process is a mess. Employees who are not in the finance department ARE handling Finance issues. 

- Managers care more about satisfying customer's demands than the staff's well-being. And that most of the managers are old employees that have abandoned the technical portion and focused only on the managing portion.
Advice to Management
- Processes need to change or infuse with newer technology. 

- Managers should upgrade themselves to become Technical Managers instead of just managers that sits in the office and show more care to the engineers who are working off-site.

2018-05-03,Anonymous,,Current Employee,A very racist company.,"Fujitsu India is MNC (Marathi National Company) in true sense. One of the most reputed company in Japan but in India its completely deteriorated due to Marathi Management.
","If you are a Non-Marathi join at your own risk. Headquartered in Pune and entire operation is being remote controlled from their. If you are a non-marathi its very difficult to survive , forget about the growth. You can validate by seeing the hierarchy. You can not find a single non-marathi in middle or top management. Even if someone was there, either sent to remote location or replaced or forced to leave. HR will convince you with sugar coated dialogues during interview or joining process as they have to achieve the target and after that you will be left to suffer by mean people. In fact complete HR department work here as mere facilitator and dont have any control over operation. They are mere puppet you can say. If you are a non -marathi they will abuse you, mentally torture you till you rum away. 95% faces I am not able to see now since I joined. Just imagine how you would cope up when you see a less experienced less skilled colleague of your getting more laurels, more growth just because he/she is a Marathi.
Advice to Management
My advice for management- Please make the environment process oriented than person oriented. Although its difficult for Indian management but try to eradicate this Marathi dominance and harassment from the organization. Try to respect the people from all race and region and implement the fair atmosphere as Fujitsu is a very reputed compeny in Japan and all over world.

Lower level management are relaxed and good to work for.

Office building could do with a re-vamp.
Good people being let leave and paying replacements higher salaries. If they would give proper salary increases to current staff, the current attrition may not be an issue.

2018-04-10,Anonymous,,Former Employee,Sales,"Flexible 
Work and life balance
","People I worked with were all great people and supportive and helpful and some are very skillful and knowledgeable.
The problem is the managements. 
Some of their KPI is to think how to reduce commissions sales people get. They set many rules that sales people have to follow so it consumes so much time and sales people cannot focus on hunting for new opportunities.
No flexibility on the process. New small rules can be created without officially announced and its not helping but only give sales people more work to do. Yet managements push sales people to sell more and hit target. 
Process just to book in the order is so tedious and sales cannot focus on hunting new opportunities. Need to spend so much time for paperwork and ask around all department for approval. 

Honestly I didn’t feel any sense of appreciation from management when I leave even they can see my contribution.
I will not recommend to join the company.

","Technical staff are not properly recognised for the work that they do and definitely not paid accordingly or anywhere near market rates. Seems to be a culture of top management take all and everyone else gets nothing. Very policy driven company, which can make things very difficult and portrays an obstructive image to customers and other external stakeholders.

Advice to Management
No real commitment to retrain or retain engineers. Short term $ thinking is sinking this company. You are retrenching talented hardworking engineers that are the people you need the most. Start valuing your employees more and don't just look at their cost. Then you may begin to have employee engagement and a more motivated and productive workforce. Employ managers who own issues and lead -- not run away at the first sign of problem.

2018-03-14,,,Former Employee,Very poor customer service skills and managers are not trained well to lead teams.,"Cannot think of any. Need honest mgmt team leads on projects. Too many of them make stuff up without knowing the technicalities of the project.
","It all depends on who you get as project team lead. Some are real horrible. Make up stuff to mislead client and if you tell them otherwise, they try to cut you off project. Prob that’s why they usually get low end clients who also don’t have much brains in mgmt. to work with.
Advice to Management
Be more ethical. You will grow your business more if you actually provide authenticity and honesty to your clients and listened to the honest team members instead of always only cut throat profits while throwing consultants under the bus. Unfortunately today, it’s very hard to find good honest ethical people on top. Everything is about profits to them at any cost.

Some good people on the desk

Certain managers are good to work for/with

 Opportunities to progress do come up

Those willing to learn/ take initiative can progress within the company, I did

Has improved in some aspects in the time I spent there (1.5 years)

Decent basic grounding in technical support, flawed but substantial knowledge base
","Nepotism (or is it just human nature)

Some management clearly brown-nosed their way up with little in the way of technical knowledge

For every good change, there will be a bad/stupid one

Micromanagement of agents, absurd constraints such as how much time per month you can use the toilet/your free time on shift (now a grand total of two hours/ month), insufficient break and lunch times.

Self-defeating constraints and red tape for red tape's sake

Relevant to above, high attrition rate of staff. Many good, competent people give up/move onto greener pastures/ get fired for stupid reasons like being one minute late too many times.

Any rube can walk through the door

Below standard pay compared to equivalent positions, even when promoted

You can just tell many people are depressed and fed up

Expected to work long hours and then get up and be back in the office early the next day, while at the same time trying to study and do up skilling tasks at home

If expensive training is undertaken then some manager charge you back for the training if you leave within 2 years

Last years transformation of Engineering services was badly botched and caused huge reputational damage with customers and massive loss of morale for the workforce.

Many technically competent colleagues
A few people recognise the need to change
There are some interesting projects
","The organisation is too disjointed, and unstructured - it has no coherent vision and cannot galvanise staff. Its performance distinctly average and this leads to patchy success, outweighed by frequent failures. 

There is a reliance on a few “good” people, and too much focus on the initial sale. 

Career and pay progression are poorly managed (if at all) and based on “local” decisions in the hands of a few, not merit.
Advice to Management
Focus more on medium term goals 3 year where more people share the success. Be more transparent about career development and pay. Focus on all aspects of performance not just sales.

2018-02-07, Senior Director,"London, England, England","Current Employee, less than 1 year",The worst move I ever made,"Apparently UK&I has a reputation as a good place to wind down your career.
It is technically undemanding (if you like that) you will not need update skills or knowledge
","I moved to UK&I from a senior management role in a leading IT company. It is not what I was promised.

One of the big challenges in Fujitsu is the quality of management and leadership. A lot of managers have been over promoted and lack the necessary business skills and qualifications to be effective. It is extremely difficult to find an MBA in UK&I. When new talent is brought in it is often side lined by VP’s who ether don’t know how to use it or feel threatened by it. 

Staff productivity and motivation is low and a lot of staff have been in the same role in Fujitsu for 20-30 years and have out of date skills and market understanding. This also blocks new talent coming in to the business and development and promotion of talent in the business.

The culture is very process heavy to compensate for the low skill base and ineffective management. Internal business services are just not fit for purpose. 

IT and IT management terrible. Internal IT forgets who the customer is and fails to understand the needs of the business effectively.

I have found HR to lack integrity and be untrustworthy. Get everything writing and signed by HR. Keep your own copy or it will be missing form your file when needed (no emails).
Advice to Management
To survive Fujitsu UK&I needs to become a lot faster and more agile. You needs to desperately bring in new talent that can change the way you work. When you do bring talent you need to make them senior enough to actually do some goo. Show more integrity and treat staff with respect (not like fools).

2018-01-25,Anonymous,,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",No progression,"Multicultural environment is well established.
","People who are promoted on a new role they dont actually got promoted in the HR system for a significant amount of time. Therefore, they are not paid fairly for the role they perform but actually paid with monthly allowance for extra responsibilities instead of a proper yearly salary. The most popular excuse on this is that the role is in developing or acting phase etc. Developing roles cannot last forever so company can pay allowances to staff and not the appropriate salary. 

Either the company is happy with employees' progress in the first 3 months or so, there is no ''probation'' period that lasts a year. 

Poor Salaries comparing to other IT companies for similar roles 
Poor management- no motivation - progress 
Low level of literacy and generally low level of qualifications
Advice to Management
Change some of the key existing polices. 

Promote progress, fairness and development at all levels within the company , not only the senior roles. 

No matter the amount of cuts, companies who do not invest on their workforce, see no long term benefits, growth and profits.

However, they have lost old and new customers to the point where their customer base is not large enough to support growth in this highly competitive industry.

2018-01-18,,,"Former Employee, less than 1 year",No leadership or direction,"Though there were few positives working at FCPA, there are wonderful employees there, with good intentions. FCPA has a gracious holiday schedule, along with a shutdown during Christmas. It is a solid place to learn a few skills, and apply them elsewhere, since there is no structure for growth.
","There were two large negatives at FCPA. Japan often pushed down initiatives with little regard or basic understanding of what that means for the workforce. There is a complete and total disconnect of what is happening not only within the office, but within the market. The other is the complete lack of management. The CEO is involved in all decisions because there is no trust of management and staff. Managers and other executives are only expected to follow orders regardless of the impact on the workforce or company. It is a culture of suspicion, and gossip.

","Clueless management completely out of touch with reality of customer, leadership team is more like an old boys club, bangs on about diversity to tick the right boxes but totally out of touch. Inappropriate jokes etc already cost one senior their job. Painfully slow to react to opportunities and incredibly high turn over of sales staff and client execs. Still living of the major service contracts of yester year and the associated churn, no sight of real innovation or winning technology.
Advice to Management
Stop saying your going to fix the problems and fix them , constantly told of improvements planned but no actual progress just lots of back slapping and mythical stories of the next major win which never materializes. Only surviving as a leadership team because the rest of the business is in an even worse state, so the all seeing eye of Sauron has not yet landed fully on them.

2018-01-13, Member of Research Staff Researcher,"Sunnyvale, CA","Former Employee, more than 5 years",Fujitsu Laboratories of America FLA Research Researchers,"- There are some great people in the lab
","- The current CEO laid off ~25% of the researchers in the lab in November 2017. Several people were in the middle of visa processing and their stay in the United States was put in jeopardy. Several people had been with the company for less than a year. There was no budget reason for the lay off, and an explanation/justification was not provided (to those laid off or to the remaining employees). If you are looking for stable employment, this is not the place for you. 

- New CEO and SVP are sent from Japan every 3-4 years. Some of them are great, and some of them are not. There is no continuity of leadership or research strategy. How this affects researchers, for example, is that when a new CEO comes in, he may decide that what a particular researcher has been doing over the *past* several years is not valuable and therefore the researcher should not be promoted (even though the researcher may have had no say in what they were working on). 

- There are also some very bad managers within the labs . Despite reports to HR and executive management, and many people leaving these managers' groups (and even interrupting their green card application processing to do so), they are not only tolerated but promoted. Managers really do have all the power here.

- Researchers want to come to the labs to do research but only some groups do research, while others heavily focus on standards, and still others focus almost exclusively on implementing prototypes. Make sure you know what you are getting into.

- A lot of interesting work cannot be conducted in the labs in the US but is instead reserved for the labs in Japan. Unlike researchers in Japan, local researchers here have to constantly apply for funding and justify and re-justify their approach and their work. This makes us feel like second-class citizens.

- Gender diversity within the labs is dismal. There is currently only 1 woman researcher in Sunnyvale. There are no attempts to recruit, retain or mentor women. In fact, 4 (out of 5) were laid off in November! There are no women in management on the research side and there have not been any over the past 10 years at least, maybe more.
Advice to Management
- Fujitsu needs to stop treating local researchers as second-class citizens, show them that their contributions are valued and give them better opportunities to transfer their work to products in Japan. 
- Bad managers should be weeded out. They destroy employee morale and drive out some of the most talented employees.
- The labs need local executive leadership that is in tune with US and Silicon Valley corporate practices and is invested in the long-term success of the lab.

2018-01-03, Senior Data Analyst,"Richardson, TX","Former Employee, more than 3 years",Good Stepping Stone / Bad Staying Place,"I was fortunate to have a good manager out of Richardson who was mindful of my workload and the scope of my projects, which made it easy to balance my work and home time.
","Not all managers care about work/life balance. Communication between divisions and department levels is minimal and causes many issues when trying to implement new processes or improvements. Transferring within the company is almost never done, this is due to preconceived notions about people from certain divisions and poor management communication.
Advice to Management
Communication is key, there is too much bureaucracy/red-tape that is holding Fujitsu America back. There are a lot of ideas with little follow through, as most people are using Fujitsu as a stepping stone to a better place - another company on the resume - rather than looking to stay with Fujitsu because of the lack of growth and poor communication. Your current management in place seems like they are more ""followers"" rather than ""Leaders"", and Fujitsu needs more leadership to ensure they get a seat at the table.

2017-12-26,Anonymous,Bangalore,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",Avoid the company as much as possible,"1. I don't think this company has any positives apart from your salary reaches on time.
2. Good company looks like if you are not working at client side
","1. Irresponsible management....That responds to a mail sent in January in July (many more cases) or sometimes don't even respond
2. Promotion policy....If you are working at client side no promotion ever
3. Low increments for employees working at client side
4. Appraisal cycle frequently changing and every year which makes it almost 15 month appraisal cycle
5. Poor salary structure...If you miss a day to fill the time sheet..They will hold 1/4th of the salary for one month and deduct ₹500 in salary
6. When they develop tools they don't consider on-site guys
7. No good policy for on-site employees
8. Management don't care....Once they deploy you at client side nobody contacts you ever.....They are just bothered about their billing nothing else
9. If you highlight any issues or concerns nobody takes the owner ship to resolve the issue...They start playing passing the ball game
10. They expect you to do things on time but do not provide required infrastructure for the same.
11. No transparency in appraisal process....Forget about transparency....You don't even get to know when it happened and only thing you get is the final change in salary....No discussion.....No communication on ratings of KRAs....Only the final result.. 
12. HR team never responds until you send 3-4 reminders
...And whatever the response you get....Is also half the information...
13. Change in policy is communicated over emails that redirects you to a page that never opens....If you contact HR about it....They won't respond
14. In appraisal process it is asked that which certification you want to achieve but looks like that is also a formality only....They don't even think of it....If you are working at client location...

As a summary in my experience, For FUJITSU if you are working at client location you DON'T EXIST for the company
Advice to Management
No advise only a request....Please try to resolve the issues mentioned above

2017-12-10, Finance Director,,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",Worst Company i have ever worked with,"I worked with Fujitsu as a Cluster Finance director started last year and left the company in less than a year, there is no Pros Fujitsu has as a business which makes it remarkable or extinctive work place and comparable to the sum of horrible things I have seen
","i will write honestly from what i saw as i had to leave the company last summer after working for almost a year with them as Finance Director.
as they say Finance is the mirror of every Business.
 
Fujitsu EMEIA has weak management and suffers from so many internal and systems issues, you cant find words to describe the turbulence, infighting, changes in decisions, so many systems and power positions with different views, management has no clear vision and no experience at all, they care about how to get their salaries end of the month and fight at year end for their bonuses after firing their teams members, each country acts differently and independently.

I was shocked when I attended the first region controlling meeting at UK office Baker St.22 with how much Fujitsu lags behind new business models and modern systems and knowledge, the problem is that in merger between Fujitsu Technology Solutions-Germany and Fujitsu Services -UK in one company the leadership assigned internally in UK has no knowledge of Products business which is totally different , ( there is famous organizational rule says ""beneath surface changes old power structure remains and the old structure is added to the old one like a house with additions, things get confusing and no one knows what to do"". 
company management has no clue of how to run a multiregional activities and showed no interest in remote regions in general , in Middle east Turkey and India management is in deep corruption and misconduct , overall you feel managers at Fujitsu either run business and manage teams fire and hire as if its their own company ? 
legal problems I have seen everywhere and issues of misconduct is huge at Fujitsu, really in deep trouble, paying bribes to third party through their resources vendors to win deals and they never get these projects delivered and late dues and legal issues start cumulating. 
So many people are on the bench, EMEIA puts hidden headcounts in remote regions to exclude them from transformation plan in Europe, eventually who loses his job in Fujitsu are those real professional and hard working people I met within the company.
So many ERP systems in Fujitsu they spent 3+ years to decide which ERP they want to go with eventually they will fail to implement any in current chaos.

Internal audit In Germany is weak, they even visited my Cluster before I joined the company and put so many trivial points without noticing that some companies in the cluster has no ERP and issuing sales invoices manually ??.
they didn't notice that some companies are joint ventures to facilitate local businesses in illegal way ?

When I tried to implement new system the management objected and constrained the whole project.
they refused to assign new procurement managers because they are paying high resources costs to third party vendors while Fujitsu resources are enjoying their time at home ? saying we don't have budget despite they hired enormous headcounts in HR and service delivery without having projects ?

in terms of work life balance its the most horrible place i have ever seen, they don't respect their employees time and days off, due to pattern of chaos everything is Urgent, the recent survey done internally showed revealed shocking outcome of employees engagement and enablement, some senior managers had been hit by chairs.
 
I always wondered why good productive and valuable people left this company in the past until I discovered all these issues after 6 months from joining .
 ""i don't recommend Fujitsu as my personal advice before anyone gets himself embroiled with this bad handicapped business, please think of another opportunity - don't ever believe this is an international business, its laterally a Grocery run by Bunch ......... ""not everything shines is Gold""

My Advice goes to Fujitsu JAPAN who are still sleeping and Oblivion.... if you want to make a good company transformation to bring Fujitsu Global to competitive position like old ICL and old Fujitsu-Siemens , fire EMEIA top management Fire all your management everywhere, bring new blood, new professional leaders, real entrepreneurs , so many are their in other ICT global players.

- Lots of experience and expertise in the company.
- Good entry level salary at graduate level.
- In a lot of roles, there is the opportunity to work remotely.
- Very supportive of people with families, good maternity/paternity leave though no personal experience of this.
- Really liked the focus on CSR and supporting charity partners - the company is genuinely committed to this.
","- Processes can be extremely slow, frustrating for us and client.
- Old boys club mentality is prevalent and off putting.
- Being told to do things ""because we have to"" even if it doesn't deliver value to us or the client, too much red tape.
- Graduate programme experience varies massively depending on where you are placed - it is disingenuous for the company to imply it is a level playing field.
- Can feel like a dinosaur - seems to be behind on major tech developments.

The training I needed for the next role up was denied to me, even though I had some of the highest stats on the service desk? 

The person being put toward the role was friends with the manager outside of the office. Brown nose

I met some genuinely talented and gifted people but because they didn’t scratch management’s back, they were denied progression.

I met people who were sour and bitter, ready to push people under the bus, who were then rewarded because they were pals outside of the office.

Comp and benefits are good but you need to negotiate well when you join as pay rises have been poor for the last few years.
","Targets seem to be a moveable feast from year to year with little link to individual opportunity/sector. You only get paid if above 50% of threshold which creates a bizarre effect in the second half of the year when people either realize they won't get there and either sandbag deals for the following year, pass them over to someone else who will hit threshold and hope they can agree a brown paper bag deal or accept that they won't get paid a bonus and start looking for a new job either internally or externally. Huge sales turnover at the moment so suffering from corporate memory failure. Last 2 years 'Transformation' has been hugely disruptive and many senior leadership roles are vacant (UK MD) or have interim post holders not empowered to take the tough decisions. All exacerbated by very cautious/conservative Japanese Parent company.
Advice to Management
Make your mind up about how you want to organise your sales teams. Set some realistic targets and other KPI's at the beginning of the year not 1/3rd of the way through.
Get some serious Sales Directors who understand their industry sectors, are credible in front of customers, inspire their teams and turn up for work more than 3 days a week. Stop hiring people with IT infrastructure backgrounds - you have enough of them already. The new world is about solving business issues. Reinvigorate the Sales culture, there is no buzz or passion at the moment, it all feels pretty stale.

2017-11-02, Mid Senior Management,"London, England, England","Current Employee, more than 3 years",Satisfying and frustrating in equal measure,"I love this company because of its people. In a 39 year career, my 4 years at Fujitsu have been some of my most rewarding. Not for the salary and benefits, frankly I could (and have) earned much more elsewhere. I love it because I feels that they genuinely value their employees and want you to succeed. Opportunities are there to make an active contribution if you wish and ‘disruptors’ are welcomed
","In an increasingly digitised marketplace Fujitsu are struggling to hold their place in the market and are having a bit of a mid life crisis. We must evolve or risk going the way of Nokia etc.... we still have outdated practices and processes that conflict with the new paradigm and that causes disconnects and discomfort especially where there are multiple change initiatives going on across the EMEIA region. Finding clear guidance on the overcomplex go to market offerings is bewilderingly mind bogglingly frustratingly painfully difficult

Simplify the go to market services. Do not impose bureaucratic processes on your employees that stifle creativity and crush good will. Trust us and you (and the shareholders) will be rewarded 10 fold

2017-11-02, IT Technician,Sydney,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","Worst company, bad employer!","Some co-workers became like a family.
","Don't ever work with these guys. The pay is very low. If you are working at NIC-Fujitsu in Lidcombe for Experis, the work environment there is very bad, lots of politics. They employ people as IT Technicians, but make them work in labour jobs doing picking/packing, stock take. Then you have to lift heavy printers, UPS etc all by yourself because Fujitsu doesn't want to spend money and is all the time looking for cost cutting opportunities. Some of the senior staff are very rude and misbehave and have made it quite difficult working in an already degraded atmosphere. It is like a prison environment, people playing politics and some employees roaming around doing nothing, they don't care much about the work. Experis will put you into this hell of an environment and keep getting promotions after promotions. They don't listen and don't care about anybody. In the end you will be the one who would be suffering because you have a family and mouths to feed. 2-3 years down the line your joints will develop cramps and your body will find it impossible to adjust. That's the story of most of the Experis employees at NIC-Fujitsu.

I can think of none.
Cons
Fujitsu North American and specifically the BAS unit is a leader free business unit that is ruled by 1990's management and solutions. The company espouses their great insight into digital transformation solutions for the marketplace yet they stifle innovation and modernization throughout the internal workforce. A good old boys club of inept sr. management that rewards the wrong behaviors and people for being mediocre and for following orders. Great place to work if you seek domineering leaders, limited advancement and growth opportunities and an atmosphere of servitude amongst the rank and file. Leaders need not apply nor seek hire as the first new thought or great idea will forever brand as nonconformist with an exit strategy in the future. A terrible place to work, especially with the current digital age transformations generating so much excitement. Don't join fujitsu if you want progress but if you like stagnation, sign up now, they need more ""yes"" people to blindly follow orders.
Advice to Management
Retire now. You are setting back all of IT by decades by your continued work. And please, don't take your sorry approach to other companies and infect them with the same diseases you've proliferated at Fujitsu.

2017-08-22,Anonymous,,Former Employee,Can't recommend working at Fujitsu America,"There are some really talented and dedicated people, especially on the technical teams. High quality computer servers, laptops and related products.
","Management by fear is rampant in the current environment with shrinking year-over-year sales in North America looming large over the staff. People (especially top managers) seem to be in positions they are not qualified for. Interesting cultural mix with an influx of European and Japanese managers making it more difficult to communicate. In my experience commitments made to employees are not respected and easily broken.

Business Outlook
Pros
An excellent company to work for and I love the location, since the office is attached to a shopping centre and close to a park. They offered me to stay at a hotel for a week until I moved into a Fujitsu owned house (rent costs are above local average however). The company also offers a type of debit card that can be used in grocery shops and restaurants (as a form of lunch allowance) and they offer medical insurance.

The job itself is typically as you'd expect. You get calls from clients and you have to help them to fix their issues. There's a laid back, yet professional atmostphere around the office and most managers are very nice.
Cons
The biggest downside is that the job is not very challenging even though it is a challenge to get your work done in time, since the FJ ticketing system lags very often.
Advice to Management
Since the salary is quite low, people keep looking for other jobs and this really hurts your employees motivation to do a good job. I'd say, motivate them to stay by giving them a higher salary. That way, you also save costs on having to hire and train new people all the time. Other than that, I loved my time in Portugal and at Fujitsu.

Cons

Work life balance promoted but not adhered to
Bullying to join projects where the required skills were beyond my experience and comfort zone and threatened with disciplinary if I said no
Blame culture when things go wrong
Appraisal process was a complete joke and always marked down my management
Little or no bonuses
Jobs for the boys culture
Poor programme management

Advice to Management
Sort your company out and start treating your people with respect and reward them accordingly. They are your best asset but they are too often taken for granted and abused. Get rid of the dinosaurs and inject some new blood into company.

Advice to Management
Replace culture with something more fitting with new zealand. It's not so much the individuals but the companies overall culture that is very dysfunctional. Always put people over processes.

2017-07-03, Analyst,,"Former Employee, more than 5 years",Complete disregard for security and communication to its employees,"There are many great individuals that work at Fujitsu, however its simply a numbers game and they are not allowed to innovate properly.
","There is a total lack of understanding at the executive level of what the security function plays within the organization. There hasn't been a proper security structure in the organization for years and there is no clear strategy in that space for moving forward. If I was a customer I would be very nervous about the security of my systems in the hands of Fujitsu. Management always say one thing to the employees and then in the back ground do another, very poor communication at the executive level and waffle on their commitments.
Advice to Management
Get serious about security before word gets out that customers are left unprotected at the best of times. Fujitsu needs secure by design versus a strategy of retro fitting security into their systems after the fact when auditors or customers come asking questions. In the long run it will cost you more money rather than if you had simply thought about it at the start of a project.

Business Outlook
Pros
If you're lucky, you'll get assigned to a client project that is exciting.
Hours are not crazy.
Cons
Like in any global business, it's who you know.
They don't value employees - know what the Christmas party was like? In a (free) open park. $1 sausages from Coles. Horrific cheap white bread rolls. Sauteed onions. THAT'S IT. No veg options. No non-alcoholic drinks other than tap water from the free water gurgler.
The exec team are all mates who have known each other well.
The CFO is also the COO - conflict of interest much?
Pay is lower than market.
Big disparity - there's a lot of non-performers who just coast and Type A high achievers who get results. No reward for outcomes. 
The business moves too slow. Competitors are winning market share left right and centre. Many have abandoned ship.
Toxic back-stabbing unsupportive culture - in several capital cities.
Advice to Management
Don't LIE - was told to my face would get a raise. Next week an email goes out saying no one is getting a raise due to economic conditions. Say what?!

2017-05-03,Anonymous,"London, England, England","Current Employee, more than 1 year",Concerned about the long term viability of the business,"There are many good, smart and collaborative people. You don't always have to spend time on Machiavellian plans to get people to help you.

Great apprentice programme, some of the 18/19 years olds are given the opportunity to make an impact and get valuable experience. 

There are some good products/solutions, if only the GTM was better executed. The whole K5 cloud proposition could be promising given open source roots but has limited traction outside Japan to date. There is a question over whether FJ can/will invest enough to truly compete with Google/Microsoft/Amazon who have been growing in this space very strongly. Many other large SI's have capitulated already.

The annual Fujitsu Forum in Munich is a very well organised event and a great showcase for the breadth of solutions on offer.

Good company benefits and expenses policy (decent car scheme - an L grade can get you a £45k Mercedes, 10% pension contribution (if you pay 10%) and a pot of flexible benefits that can be bought/sold if required), will pay for a good quality hotel if you need to stay away. 

The London office is in a vibrant location (close to tube, cafe's, restaurants etc) but seating can be at a premium if you're not early and usual issues around getting meeting rooms.

There is respect for personal time and flexible working isn't a problem, at my level anyway.

Internal cafes are at subsidised prices. Less than £1 for a coffee and quality is ok. Vending machines serve free drinks (if you can put up with the quality/plastic cups).

There is limited BYOD (no laptops) but you can connect your phone/tablet to corporate Exchange so you don't have to use the awful Windows Phone you get given. It works a lot better on iOS (native) than Android (you have to download and use a clunky 3rd party productivity app).

You can request a corporate credit card to cover expenses. The expenses and travel booking system has been replaced & improved recently. Any personal expenses get paid pretty quickly and if you take a company car you get a fuel card (but have to re-imburse private mileage).

Japanese colleagues are wonderful hosts, if you are lucky enough to travel to Japan. 

There is investment available to build new solutions but it has a short term ROI expectation. FJ is in need of better technical visionary leadership to build the right things, not just ""anything and hope"".

Genuinely promotes diversity and community responsibility. Most of my colleagues are kind and considerate.
","It has realised a little too late the emerging trends and is scrabbling around to be relevant in the market. 

Still overly reliant upon a number of large accounts and (in the UK) the defence business to prop up the rest of the business. EMEA integration still a ""work in progress"" with much confusion around the operating model. 

Not at all agile, too much governance and process, even for small deals. Cultural reluctance to take risk. 

There is a big disconnect between what (and how things) happen in Japan and elsewhere in the world. And with that, little connection between what EMEA is doing and what North America is doing, despite common leadership. The Japanese skill of incremental innovation isn't wearing well in the new disruptive world.

It may right itself but many good people have been let go whilst there is still a lot of dead wood, many checking on whether people are doing their jobs properly. It's not uncommon to get on weekly operational calls and have 20 senior leaders present, half of who don't contribute. This is (or used to be!) the Public Sector mentality of looking busy but not actually being productive. Perhaps a hang up from the ""old days"" that needs to be sorted out.

Not a lot of organised social events/clubs (but colleagues are up for post-work socialising).

Bonus has been almost none existent (unlike promise during interview). Depending on the scheme you have very little personal ability to affect what you get.
Advice to Management
All the talk/marketing around agile/digital/innovation needs to be put into practice. Not enough time has been given to help it mature. Many in the organisation have embraced Digital only to find themselves held back by outdated thinking and processes elsewhere, which stifle innovation & sales. 

Fresh blood is good (and necessary, given the long average FJ tenure) but getting it from similarly monolithic competitors won't help. 

Reduce the amount of monitoring/tracking/governance to enable agility and competition with other large SI's and smaller players. This will also improve the bottom line.

Look at breaking out some truly standalone businesses that don't have all the corporate legacy/governance but give them enough funding and time to deliver. It is well proven that large corporates cannot incubate disruptive technologies within their normal walls. Their legacy crushes it. Fujitsu is suffering from this.

Repor","All the talk/marketing around agile/digital/innovation needs to be put into practice. Not enough time has been given to help it mature. Many in the organisation have embraced Digital only to find themselves held back by outdated thinking and processes elsewhere, which stifle innovation & sales. 

Fresh blood is good (and necessary, given the long average FJ tenure) but getting it from similarly monolithic competitors won't help. 

Reduce the amount of monitoring/tracking/governance to enable agility and competition with other large SI's and smaller players. This will also improve the bottom line.

Look at breaking out some truly standalone businesses that don't have all the corporate legacy/governance but give them enough funding and time to deliver. It is well proven that large corporates cannot incubate disruptive technologies within their normal walls. Their legacy crushes it. Fujitsu is suffering from this.

2017-05-02, Engineer,"Richardson, TX","Current Employee, more than 8 years",Mass changes and layoffs coming down the pipe,"Decent paycheck
Gym and cafeteria are on site at FNC in Richardson
Nice HQ in easy to access location in metroplex
","Aging middle management has ruined this company
All the older management don't care or try to be inventive. 
This mindset runs off all the young talent because they are huge roadblocks. 
They are now combining companies across the US to try and do cost savings, retirement offers have gone out to people. 
FAI has been an utter failure for the last ten years yet they are keeping it alive. 
They are starting to think all of IT can now suddenly be sent to the cloud and be supported by India, they couldn't be more wrong. 
It's a cluster mess, unless you need at job stay away.
Advice to Management
Where to begin? Your slow Japanese thinking and processes along with refusing to take risks and clean up the bad seeds has just destroyed your American market share and profits. Unfortunately nothing I type here will reverse this course you set out on 8-10 years ago. Good luck to everyone who will be impacted by this.

2017-04-19, Senior Solution Architect,Sydney,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",Senior Solution Architect,"Although my role is client facing but I can work remotely. No need to face client everyday. Slow paced and easy work environment.
","At Fujitsu, we mostly work on traditional IT. Lack of vision and strategy are visible company wide. As a solution architect, it is very frustrating to see this company does not want to engage in high tech opportunities. This company only participate in low level IT contract and engagement i.e. help desk and desktop support. Sometimes it's frustrating to see why Fujitsu needs solution architect at workplace when they participate in low level contract. 

Although Fujitsu manufactured K-computer but Fujitsu does not have any commitment to innovation. In the last few years innovation mostly down to zero level. 

As far as architecture and project management concern, there is no real architecture team to architect any infrastructure. There is no project to manage or govern although there are senior management in project management. 
Senior management is reluctant to undertake any project activities. It is probably the worse senior management I ever work with.

2017-04-08, Service Manager,Noida,Former Employee,Good company but weak leadership,"Ease of work,increments, work culture
","Management in India is mostly Pune based hence if you are at any other location there will be no visibility. Also all management is from Tech mahindra so dont except anything innovative. You will find many old employees in management with no skills or real world worth but highly political. Guess thats how they survived for so long.
Advice to Management
There is more to world outside pune and as a matter of fact most of the high performing individuals in the organisation are non- marathis so please get this cultural biased removed. Also if you are not interrsted in people outside pune then close all offices.

2017-04-07, Systems Engineer,Sydney,"Former Employee, more than 3 years",Well paid company,"promoted from 7*24 engineer to Associated Engineer to System Engineer within 3 years.
Work balance with life.
very short working hours - i will say about 10 hours per week. other time were idle and relax.
paid OT/call out when i was in, not sure about today situation. some engineers of my team got 150k per year OT. more than my salary, I didn't dare to claim that much. if you postponed all your work to after hours and do nothing in work, you get much paid.
","no new tech. same tech over last 20 years or maybe next 20 years. good luck Fujitsu.

2017-04-06, Field Service Engineer,"Birmingham, England, England","Former Employee, more than 3 years",Shockingly bad,"None from an engineer's point of view.
","Shocking treatment of lower level engineers. No quality control over parts, hence the huge number of Faulty on Fit parts when on site. Management who were totally disinterested in major issues like the latter and only wanted to sit and tick boxes on spreadsheets to improve closure figures. Call allocation with no planning or coordination, call centre staff with no basic map skills, encouraged to ""get calls of the system"" rather than allocate calls to engineers with relevant skillset, security clearance or H&S training, or event in a relevant location.
Easily the worst company I have ever worked for, no surprise to find they are ditching their hardware support contracts and getting rid of their engineers.
Never been so happy to be leave a job, the most negative environment of my career.

2017-03-16, Incident Manager/Service Control Officer,"Wakefield, England, England","Current Employee, more than 3 years",Average but a good starting position,"Fujitsu are a good company for taking on people with limited experience or qualifications. If you're willing to start at the bottom and work your way up this is a good place to start.
","The pay is by par below the market average, the justification for the pay scale at the low roles is you do not need previous experience or qualifications, however as you move up the company you need to evidence everything you do, if you do have the experience and qualifications then you won't be considered for the role (just like most companies) however you would therefore expect as you process the pay would reflect the market average but it falls way short thought the company, putting the previous justification of low pay into question.
This is backed up by the high turnover of staff as people come in to the company and then leave for much more money once experience is gained.
Advice to Management
Realize peoples potential, look after the people that are committed and want to achieve with the company and always reward this accordingly.

-work with some great people
-in a good location for commuting with good public transport links and on site parking
-on site gym and canteen
","-very low salary
-yearly appraisals where you are required to perform like a clapping seal infront of a board of managers for a potential but very unlikely extra £10 a month
-no career progression, almost feels like you are encouraged to stagnate at the bottom
-many people on 1st line were very technically competent but any suggestions of a move to another team always fell on deaf ears
-culture is very cliquey, the few that do get promotions get them not because they deserve them but because they are friends with managers
-same inner circle of managers/supervisors tend to do absolutely no work whatsoever but are always on peoples backs while they watch youtube videos and gossip amongst themselves all day
-poor job security, in my time there people were made to train their Russian replacements before being made redundant

-pay your employees what they are worth and stop outsourcing to Russia

","Red tape all over the place. 
They want you to be honest, they value sincerity. When the time comes for you to say what you think, to provide feedback, you are judged based on your opinion. Be prepared to hear a lot of, ""talk to your manager"", ""you can approach HR"", etc. When you provide your feedback you will be put aside and viewed as a blocker/problem maker.
Thanks to this, people talk a lot among themselves about what they think but never reach out to their managers, or any hierarchy about what they think.

Internal progression based more on your ability to sell yourself, rather than performance, ability to execute, evidences. Problem is, people sell themselves and no questions asked.
Perception is king!

No bonus pay for any role above Agent.

Company grew a lot in the recent years, support structures failed to keep up with it.

Very hard to park in the area, unless you come in to work real early in the morning.
Advice to Management
LISTEN (plain simple listening to what is being said and not what you interpret of what is being said) and ACT upon it.

Great career progression for managers
The people who actually do the front line work.
","Process and admin tasks get in the way of doing your job.
Career development opportunities rare
Lack of investment in the right people
Top heavy with management
Too many barriers to productivity
Constant threat of redundancy
The manner in which they are conducting the most recent cull in staff is an utterly disgrace... uncertainty for those involved and never knowing for weeks at a time if you are going to be axed or not. All done by email or telecast... no personal intervention which is cowardly and unprofessional. Loyalty and dedication count for nothing... ifollow your face fits and you can trot out a few clichés and buzz words you'll go far.
Advice to Management
Glossy facades don't cover a fundamental lack of investment in the right people. Constant cost cutting in people instead of dealing with the real issues will only work so often.

Pros
Joined the company over 2 years ago, was a conscious decision to move back into full time employment with the stability that offered, by joining a large multinational company, incl good pension, company car and other benefits i.e health care cash plan. Potential for ongoing training and career improvement. Also a very good work / life balance.
Cons
Since then the company has undertaken a massive cost cutting exercise as part of it's 20/20 vision, this has led to a wide range of job cuts across the UK, incl. outsourcing to offshoring facilities in India. This has has led to a total drop in morale, at least for myself and colleagues / peers in the UK who are currently in a redundancy exercise and not sure if we will keep our jobs or not. But still expected to put in the extra effort to meet client commitments. Makes you question the company's ethics of the 'Fujitsu way' and responsible business. No trust or belief in the leadership team, they don't appear to understand the challenges faced by staff on the ground dealing with clients.
Advice to Management
Be more honest to employees, treat them with respect. Re-establish an employee forum / charter (Fujitsu Voice) - which the company served notice on last year which resulted in their termination in January '17.

Pros
Fujitsu hire really talented people.
Great projects, lots of good technology. Lots of opportunity to learn new tech.
As many people stay there of well over 10 years they are very good at supporting you on a personal level. (I raised a family whilst there).
Cons
Management promise career progression but unless you are in with the right people it won't happen.
Be prepared to sit in the same job/role for many, many years.
Lots of posters about career paths that look glossy but end up in the basement cafe behind the stairs.
Only way to get a promotion is to leave and come back.
Advice to Management
Stop promising that everyone can move up the ladder, they can't.

This advise for high management : need to invest in people. There are a lot of IT certification in the market but Fujitsu do not sponsor or just few people gets ITIL certification. Also I feel a little bit portuguese people get career oportunities more than other nationalities get. There is no company's culture. Managment need to be more genuine.

2016-12-23, Sales Executive,"London, England, England","Former Employee, more than 1 year",New Business Sales - Avoid unless you are taking on a house account.,"Good Work-Life balance, flexible working and a decent overall compensation package. Baker Street sales office is a good place to be based in London. Good if you are on a long-standing house account, especially in Public Sector.
","They have left it far too late to change to align to the new market requirements of cloud, mobility and digital transformation and as a consequence are now way behind the likes of Accenture, Capgemini and IBM who all transformed several years ago.
Not enough offshoring and automation of back-end delivery and are losing deal after deal on price against competitors who do. Too many senior managers from old-world backgrounds (BT, HP) and no-one in a U.K. Leadership role with any experience of transforming a business into one fit for the digital world.
Next 2 years are going to be unpleasant as they shed 1/3 of their UK workforce and political agendas, protectionism and navel-gazing dominate.
Advice to Management
Think about the opportunity to use the next 2 years of change to be bold and leapfrog the competition, rather than just play catchup where the competition will have moved on again by the time the program is completed. Sadly, I got the impression that this won't be the case - hence my leaving to join a growing business rather than stay at one clearly in decline.

2016-12-23,Anonymous,,Current Employee,"Risk of redundancy today, perhaps new opportunities in the pipeline","Large international company, wide spectrum of roles with some flexibility to move around if you network and drive it. Some good managers (I have had mixed experiences). Offices all over the UK and internationally. Some roles and mangers support flexible working, some don't. Fair company pension contribution, healthcare, 25 +/- 5 days leave, company car for most management roles, and other benefits. The majority of people I have worked with have been perfectly pleasant. Many employees stay with Fujitsu long term, and many return after leaving because it is generally 'comfortable', though less so today with redundancies.
","Significant restructuring and redundancies; leadership is very selective about what information is released. Some line managers are not good. Work-life balance in some roles can be poor if you want to do a good job. Long term employees will fall far behind market rate. No company share or investment benefits (Japanese company). Appraisal process is a formality, which fails to recognise or reward individual performances. Feeling less like the people company of 10 years ago and culture starting to align more closely with our American competitors.

12 months ago I would have recommended Fujitsu, today I would suggest waiting for the restructuring to complete.
Advice to Management
Share the more detailed information you are withholding about the restructuring. Share the target company structure, not just the cuts you want to make, as today we feel like numbers on a P&L. Provide more information on the skills required and how you intend to secure or develop them. Use the appraisal process to drive and reward good performance; it does neither.
