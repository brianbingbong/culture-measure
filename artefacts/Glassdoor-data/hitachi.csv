2019-09-15, Business Analyst,"Toronto, ON","Current Employee, more than 5 years",The worst place I’ve ever worked for!!!,"Exposure to industry standards with a global brand determined to expand. Good for those starting their careers, but not for experienced hands.
","If not for my line manager, and a few wonderful colleagues - who have also left, I will say this place is nothing short of racism with a very toxic and bad culture. I experienced discrimination from day one when placed in a team to work with on a client site. The politics stinks, if your not part of the people they like, you get second hand information, promotion won’t come your way, they will dangle carrots in a very dishonest way. Preference are given to those who were part of the old company that Hitachi bought over, new recruits after the take over are clearly treated differently. Junior colleagues with far less experience or knowledge get promoted above their senior colleagues with decades of experience. Very good skilled resources who look and sound different to the ‘locals’ with excellent ideas get shut down or cast aside simply because a ‘favourite’ doesn’t like it. Their way or the high way - period. Training - nothing like that, your thrown into the sea and left to figure out how to swim, and your expected to be a super star. Call it set-up to fail. Career - your potential and desire is irrelevant. Management seems to be concerned more about submitting billable hours to the clients, more than the potential their consultants have to grow. Colleagues who have a connection to the top, will easily bypass your line manager and bad mouth you. Appraisals, criticism or feedbacks are more subjective than objective People are abruptly laid off like chips falling of the table, no project from the client and your not part of the ‘favourites’ then your on the chopping block, and when asked why, it’s “Oh so sorry, we’re trying an new thing and it didn’t work out “ - people careers used as an experiment. Job security - Zero...a client will love your work, but if a ‘favourite’ colleague with connections to the top local management team member has an issue with you, your gone on the flimsy excuse possible.

Yelling, threatening emails, not answering our emails, basically treats everyone in the division, except the manager, like dirt. - Almost no communication between employees within divisions. For example, sales coordinators would not know anything about what a person in sales is talking about, and vice versa. The people working here are REALLY nice. If only they were nice to work with... Mostly it's a management problem. They tend to segregate their workers and promote a sink or swim culture whether you drown in work until you can't take it anymore, or learn to rise above it. JP is always trying to stand in the way of basically every decision being made, and will do their best not to work with you. Again, the people in JP are all really nice too, just not great to work with.

Generous amount of time off (for Japan). Highly regulated working hours, meaning you will get all proper overtime pay as necessary. Nothing shady in general.
","Very conservative, ""no frills"" environment (no real perks, featureless walls and hallways). Penny-pinching atmosphere in general. Promotions are limited by strict quotas on number of people per year as determined by upper management (i.e., people that don't know you) meaning your job could easily morph into something more akin to a higher position, but it could be a while before you are officially receiving the benefits thereof.

","Where do I begin? Honestly!!! Most companies value (at least to an extent) their employees. HCF (Hitachi Cable Florida) treats them as cow meat. Managers and VPs prefer to yell and scream at hourly associates on a REGULAR basis. I have seen this first hand as a salaried associate numerous times. Unfortunately, most of the other salaried associates ""buy"" into the treatment of hourly personnel because they are young and have no experience elsewhere. The work environment is EXTREMELY toxic. I have yet to work in one that this this convoluted. Mind you, I have worked for many manufacturers. If you are currently interviewing with this company at this location (likely with Talis Group (am i right?).... RUN!!!) I'll provide you with some food for thought... Ask the following questions: How many HCF managers have college degrees?... of any kind!!! How many HCF managers can use correct grammar? When you had an on-site interview did you get to meet any of the quality or engineering team? I doubt it! This is their tactic! This location of Hitachi supposedly performs poorly yet turns a profit year after year. The plant purports to operate on a shoestring budget. They can't afford anything. A simple expenditure in excess of $1000 requires an act of the Hitachi congress. This can take up to 9 months.... that's just in my experience. ( I was there a short while). I literally saw garbage bags used as air ducts to divert air flow for the air conditioning while they waited on approval for the repair. The garbage bags were in place for MONTHS!! Ask yourself... IS THIS THE COMPANY I WANT TO WORK FOR? IS THE BEACH REALLY WORTH IT?

It's purely sales driven organization, no place for technical resources. Please don't be fooled by Hitachi's name. It's no where near to Hitachi brand and they are ruining Hitachi's name and brand.

The IT department is unorganized and unregulated. There is no proper tracking of computers, laptops, or other office equipment or computer accessories. User account aren't set up the right way through group policies and nobody seems to really care. No proper storage space for computers and computer equipment. Loose and improperly installed cables on the server and throughout the office and warehouse. They have over 200 employees and they don't even use a ticketing system for the IT Help Desk or enter new employees into Active Directory user groups. When a good idea is suggested or implemented, higher-ups with no tech background ignore them or change them back to old ways that are inefficient. IT department not informed of new employees ahead of time causing the new employee to show up without a workstation set up. Vacant desk are left dirty and/or trashed with all the old stuff left over from previous employees. The new employee gets a mess or they just get a desk with ""nothing"" on it.
