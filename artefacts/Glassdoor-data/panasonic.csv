2021-06-06, Senior Buyer,"Sparks, NV","Current Employee, more than 3 years",Support Functions Are Taken for Granted,"The company offers very competitive pay and benefits. There are many opportunities for promotion. The nature of the product and industry is going to help curb GHG emissions and bring about innovation in the transportation industry, so there is a strong sense of pride and mission in your work. Working with Japanese ex-patriots and at a Japanese company is always a positive, unique experience. It is a fast-paced work environment so it’s never boring. The facility offers free snacks and coffee with many restaurants and food trucks for breakfast and lunch options.
","The work/life balance heavily leans towards the work side. The pay from promotions is not commensurate with the additional workload / responsibilities. The facility and manufacturing process is dirty, difficult, and dangerous, creating as much, if not more, pollution than the company tries to cut via batteries for EV’s. The building is only 5 years old but it looks run down, with cracks in the floors, holes in the walls from forklifts, and trash left in the stairwells from construction workers (yes, construction is still being done). 
The snacks are okay, but the coffee is awful. No matter which flavor, the taste is bitter because the coffee containers are always on, burning the brew. There are no windows and the building is painted white, so it looks like a giant hospital/psychiatric ward inside 

The company is siloed, causing confusion and inconsistency for project and production implementation. In practice, this together with the management’s perverted notion of accountability perpetuates a culture of blame. Support functions such as the Procurement, Quality, and Training departments are taken for granted and seen as a nuisance. Yet, when things are going well, and records being are broken, there’s little to no recognition for these functions. They remain overworked and under-resourced.
Advice to Management
Recognize that production is not possible without the support functions and try to have some empathy towards these departments with respect to their responsibilities and the small amount of resources they have to accomplish them.

2021-03-09, Digital Marketing Specialist,"Newark, NJ",Current Employee,So close to being great,"The company culture at Panasonic is fantastic and is probably the best part of working here. The organization does seem genuinely to care about to making the world a better place, not just through its products and solutions but also through its social impact initiatives and commitment to workplace diversity. (This is by far the most diverse tech company I have ever worked for, and I love that.) The benefits are fairly generous and include a week of paid time off specifically for volunteering (in addition to vacation days, sick time, personal days and 12 paid company holidays). The company has many smart people working here, which makes it a pleasure to collaborate with coworkers.
","Panasonic has many of the same issues as similar large organizations that have been around for over a century. The company struggles with agility and meeting the challenges of the digital age - and frankly, this is a serious issue for a technology company seeking to attract digitally savvy talent. Along these lines, leadership frequently has trouble accepting the need to pivot when it becomes clear that something is not working. It's not uncommon for management to double down on bad decisions rather than addressing them, and this creates frustration for the people on the front lines who must deal with these problems every day. The result is that employee retention suffers as people repeatedly run into obstacles that make it difficult (or even impossible) to do their jobs well. In the small department I work for (<50 employees), we have lost a dozen people over the last 18 months - five of which were among our senior leadership. Only two of those employees have since been replaced (and one of those replacements left after just seven months), so it's clear that something about the way we operate is driving people to greener pastures.
Advice to Management
Value the expertise of those that you hired to do the work. Hire replacements for the people who have left to reduce some of the strain on their colleagues. Listen to employees' pain points and be open to their solutions rather than being dismissive. Be willing to admit when you don't know something. And consider how you're treating your millennial employees - these are digital natives with fresh ideas and perspectives whose expertise is often undervalued. A strong benefits package can't make up for a lack of professional respect.

","Management is very inexperienced in their rolls. For instance, a chemist is managing a team of chemical engineers, mechanical engineers, controls engineers, and more, without understanding their rolls in the company. Because of this, there is no direction from management, and projects are complete chaos because decisions are being made by people who don’t understand the systems that they are making decisions on. There is also little to no room for career development, and most engineers spend the majority of their time working on tasks that are actually the responsibility of Production and Maintenance.

Company politics that you will never experience elsewhere

The worst management that i ever see. Low salary with long work hours. Management do not listen to employees, do not appreciate employees effort. They are live in their own world and refuse to acknowledge their mistake. Highly not recommend. If you want to experience the Japanese politics in Singapore, then here is the right place.
Advice to Management
Before you ask the employees to follow the Panasonic philosophy, first please take the lead. The philosophy is easy to understand, but I dont see the management follow the rules. Employees are the company greatest asset, not the cheap labour and puppet.

- Fun workplace environment, lots of fun team activities each quarter
- Great people - culture fit is emphasized in hiring process
- Autonomy to make decisions on technology and tools that best fit the team
- Good work/life balance
","- Some of the cons you would see with a typical startup are present (e.g. small user base, internal processes developing/changing), despite having all of the support a major corporation has to offer
- Minimal barriers to getting promoted or moving laterally, but getting that change reflected officially by HR (title/compensation changes) can be long-winded
- Working on government contracts can result in having to shift priorities to keep funding

Note on the only negative reviews for the Denver area: They were left by the same disgruntled employee who was let go from the company and took his anger out on Glassdoor. I do not feel they accurately reflect the Cirrus team or its values - other former and current software engineers would echo this sentiment.

","Everything else aside from above. The upward movement is restricted to who you know not what you know. Machine operators are overworked. Techs haven't had raises in over a year. Operators and material handlers continue to get raises. Production management doesn't care about employees. Preach HPC culture, don't practice it. Don't care about employee health, for covid 19, they don't even do the cleaning you would think. They clean a couple buttons and move on. Don't do the contract tracing they say they do. Desk job employees who never step foot on the actual floor have a better chance of promotion than anyone on the actual production for. Training minimal, if at all. Constant rat race. Unreal expectations. Do your job, and three other jobs and then get into trouble for trying to pick up the slack. No support. Parts needed to fix machines aren't even available.

- Easy work
- Easy to move up
- Good money starting
- lots of days off ( 4 days /3 days weeks *alternated.)
","(This was my shift however not sure about the other shifts)
-Understaffing makes it a very unpleasant and stressful environment 
- Younger co workers most of which always had little “highschool” drama
- No organization
- leadership is questionable “too many chiefs” made for a annoying and stressful day
Advice to Management
I understand that the understaffing isn’t necessarily something you as a company could control. However I do feel as though there were things as an employee that could have helped in the prevention of people leaving. One being that the leadership in particularly in the area and on the shift I worked. Everyday was an unclear plan on how to have a successful day. For example, when given our tasks for the day it was all based on favoritism, and i didnt care as long as i had something to do i was just there to work, however it was stressful and irritating when our lead would see we only had about 8 ppl for the day and she would take about 4 (her buddies of course) to do “projects” or train in daily counts thus leaving 4 people which would result in 2 people per area. These areas could easily run smoothly with 4+ Employees and can run “okayish” with about 3 employees, meaning with the 2 employees per area it was going to be really hard. Somedays, since this was so frequent, we would get behind in work to the point the machine operators had no material to continue working. Our lead then would come and try to help after since she had been talked to by her supervisor. Still this behavior never changed even when brought up to hirer mangers. Also during this pandemic time, multiple employees began to unfortunately get sick and some even contracted the virus. Coworkers that I worked with everyday, the had tested positive and didnt come in, yet our leadership did not inform any of the employees who had been working with these employees that they had tested positive. Therefore we had no idea we were in contact with covid and alot of us have elderly people who live at home with us. Some with health conditions already. For a company that preaches safety it just never felt safe.

Cons
Business side likes to hinder IT, resistent to change.
Every change implemented, detailed testing needs to be done and explained to business. Even something as minute as a 10e-7 numerical difference. This makes progress extremely slow, and hinders the pace of learning of in the development team to come up with extremely detailed tests in the form of nicely formatted excel for business side to go through, in several reviews
Advice to Management
Facilitate more on communication between business and IT. By leaving yourself out of the process and throwing the IT team to handle every single inquiry by business (even when unreasonable), pace becomes too slow. Innovation is about fast iterations, our competitors are already running rounds around us while we are scrambling to explain every single details of change to our business people

","Panasonic India leadership is not worth, I don't know when India Panasonic made profit all together in every business they do.

Still there are more to do in R&D, Research and localisation for softwares to catch the market.

What are we covering to gap in each segment with top competitors ?
Like TVs - Can you see the gap is increasing every day, months and year ?
AC/Refrigerators - same as above, the gap between top players and Panasonic is increasing , new players are doing better than us.
Mobile - what Panasonic did ? In India people are struggling to get non Chinese good mobile devices but there are no choices given by Panasonic ? aren't we loosing a great opportunity ? But what Panasonic did in Mobile H/W and S/W R&D - nothing.

I think its time to re-vamp , re-start from fresh. With new leadership , new ideas and new implementation.

We have a Brand Name, Good Products and Trust of Indian consumer.
Should work to leverage customer with high quality, feature rich product in very balanced price segment.

4. Good Group of Americans and Japanese to work with. Personnel are friendly all the way to the top.

5. Unique ideas heard by management.

6. A lot of American and Japanese employees working for 20 plus years. They take good care of the senior employees. Loyalty is definitely rewarded.
","1. Very regionalized with a lot of silos. Difficult to understand as they are considered a very big multi national company.

2. Once a decision has been made in Japan, they will stick to it even if they know it is wrong. Japanese expats do not really push back to mid or top management in Japan. American management does but they do not always have the backing of their local Japanese members sitting in Newark or Mountain View or Chicago or Detroit.

3. Very low starting salary for entry level graduates. However, salary increases very significantly after about five years and/or by experience.

Please continue to maintain the very good work culture we have. But we need to break out of our regional or BD level silos in order to behave like a true Global Organization.

","This is my experience, not someone else's. It is based on personal experience and opinion.
C.E.R.N. is like a big elephant and it is difficult to move it or change it. One can feel the bureaucracy permeating the place everywhere. Projects/technology feel sometimes way behind the industry. Managers/supervisors/leaders unfortunately do not qualify as such in many cases. I know people with great experiences in this place, so I would say it depends largely on the section/projects you are involved with.

","As previous remarks, is basically favoritism culture. Lots of senior old Tai QI masters, so If you love to work till your health breaks down, like my ex colleagues, pls proceed. My ex colleagues who worked so hard, got themselves into high blood pressure etc, but mgmt do not really care. To survive, just be a YES person, even when bottom of your heart, is stupid work.

Oh yes. Pay raise of less than $100 dollars is normal. Bonus, if they dun like you, you get zero. They did this to ex-GM and managers. Zero bonus??? Why join just a company who may do this to you eventually? 

Remember, when you just join, you will be a shining star, bright and shiny. If you know how to lick, you will survive. If not, you will be just another fallen star.

Conclusion, go join other company IT.
Advice to Management
Retire ASAP, esp the MD. So not call yourself CSO either, you basically ride on our expertise and making our lives difficult. You know nothing. Stop smiling also, because they contains lots of ""hidden daggers"". 

Hope Japan HQ will replace this MD in 2020, the year I left.

2020-02-21, Mechanical Engineer,"Sparks, NV","Former Employee, more than 3 years",Solid Work Environment; Needs Organizational Evaluation,"Working at Panasonic was a great experience that I will forever value. They gave my career a jump-start and the opportunities for development are endless. It's a high-paced environment and a lot of people which make it feel like it's own community. There's never a shortage of work. Management is improving with the adoption of strong leaders that challenge the way the company has been run for years.
","The decision-making skills of management are sub-par. HR is terrible and the security department exists to harass and police employees. HR and upper management align in too many ways in a way that makes every single employee feel powerless if you're on anyone's bad side. The company claims that they care about their people, but shuts you out and avoids you if you're even the slightest inconvenience. They're whole objective is to make money. They also give percentage-based raises and don't bother to understand the effects of it (i.e. they would hesitate to give someone with a $50K salary a 10% raise to keep up with cost of living or based on great performance, but are perfectly okay giving someone else with a $100K salary a 5% raise with mediocre performance, despite them being the same amount in quantity).

They stay competitive in the community for their pay and benefits. Retention of a Panasonic position is not a challenging endeavor for a skilled and effective individual.
","Panasonic Energy of North America is growing rapidly and has been struggling to train employees as fast as they hire people. Safety is suffering from the lack of proper training and the need to get proper personnel coverage to fast paced work areas that often times safety violations are over looked or even ignored until they are in the center of a workplace incident that involves a serious injury that, too many times, could have been prevented. Incidents such as described barely happen on a regular basis, but when they have happened, they happen for the simplest of safety oversights and seem to be a source of way too severe injuries.
Advice to Management
I know that the extremely high rate of growth is what seems to be a sure sign of success, but slow things down enough to make safety improvements and improve the quality of training for employees who do not have a lot of experience in industrialized environments that pose a threat to their lives, and constantly reinforcing the dangers of industrial injuries and other equipment related injuries to the experienced employees at the same time. I know that I constantly try to be aware of anything that is a threat to my safety and health, and still got injured due to someone's inability to get through work without their phone in their face.

2020-01-09, Digital,"Bracknell, England, England","Former Employee, more than 1 year",Ineffective Management Structure,"Company Benefits, Office & cafes on site, free parking
","Managerial Structure means nothing can get done unless signed off by 4 different levels, too slow at keeping up with the digital pace, Japan's head office not wanting to progress digitally or keep up with innovations. Staff who have been there for years are promoted into positions due to their service length but they are too great for them. No one seems to be very organised or has a clue, communication is terrible and never fed down to the teams who need it.
HR do not listen, the same complaints made time and time again but nothing is changed as a result. Internal bullying ongoing as a result.

Quite a depressing place to work especially for younger individuals.
Advice to Management
Listen, and be a lot more receptive to change. Just because something has 'always been done like that' doesn't mean it should remain that way.

Advice to Management
At this point I’m not sure management wants to hear any advice. We were told that we should embody leadership and set examples, which turned out to be a guise for putting in unpaid overtime and taking more responsibility than the job description, but when it came time to be rewarded for that extra effort either though raises or promotions, or even the ability to make decisions that directly affect our work, we were told to fall in line. It was all smiles and uplifting talk, until the projects ran into problems directly related to management’s inability to understand the industry. They offer no leadership or support, and as soon as anything goes wrong they will throw underlings under the bus despite never giving workers the tools or empowerment to make any significant changes in the first place. Damned if you do damned if you don’t. Do not join this company unless you are willing to be the scapegoat for management. On the plus side it’s hard to get fired, but that also means you’re hauling a lot of dead weight. We had 9 hours of meetings a week.

They promoted ill qualifed people that have never worked in manufacturing over people who are hard workers because they brown nose the right people. Their training program is a joke and they hire anyone with a pulse to do the job weither they are crack addicts or alcoholics. So many times have I seen people getting high in the parking lot and seen discarded needles on the ground. Pena prides themselves on hitting 6 billion cells.

It also offers good good training (depending on what department you are in, some department lack training opportunities). But generally, it gives you the opportunity to travel overseas for seminars and training. The people are welcoming and the Japanese people in the management are very fun to be with. The office environment is okay.
","Some departments in the organization lack training opportunities, such as mine with the Project Sales department. Although there are a few trainings and seminars available due to Japanese employees of Panasonic come to the Philippines to conduct them, but the company (PMPC) and the employees there have limited learning opportunities. In my case as a Design Engineer with Panasonic Manufacturing Philippines Corporation, when I first got there, they do not conduct basic seminars to give its employees basic knowledge on their products. I was also not taught well in in-depth air-conditioning system designing and proper unit selection. I had to study those by myself. Also, the management is not good as they do not have clear directions with their organizational structure, and some managers with give you different directions on what you should do.

The management should have better organizational structure. Management should also be clear when setting directions for the company and its employees. Also, they should encourage employee growth through proper education and training. They should invest more in giving an employee proper knowledge, because that would be an asset for the company in the future.

Constant restructuring. Lacking in vision. To say there’s no accountability is an understatement.

2019-07-10,,,Former Employee,Gigafactory PENA is a joke. I'd give this review a 0 if I could.,"Okayish benefits

Basically nothing else
","Awful (and racist) management. I'm a white man and even I noticed during my brief stay here that every single management position was filled by a Japanese man. There were no women. There were no people of color. There were no white people. 

The Japanese made all of the decisions and treated everyone who wasn't Japanese as second class workers. They then proceeded to underpay and overwork everyone as much as possible. I was literally called into a 1-1 meeting with my boss (3 months into my job) where he asked me why I was leaving around 5:30pm every day when (and I quote) ""as an engineer you are expected to to either take work home with you or stay late."" Nah, I've been on the job for 3 months and already stay 30 extra minutes each day. If management is running such a tight ship that a new junior engineer leaving at 5:30 is impacting engineering efforts you have bigger problems.

If that wasn't bad enough I didn't actually work as an engineer. I was hired and paid as one but management decided that because my background (software) didn't directly align with Panasonic's short or mid term goals (then why hire me?) that I should be with the technicians in the lab manually disassembling batteries all day every day. Literally the biggest waste of life ever. 

Also, whenever something on the floor went poorly basically everyone was forced to stay late unless they managed to slip out of the office without a manager seeing them. On more than one occasion I was forced to stay until past 8pm doing secretarial work like writing up reports for the Japanese management because I spoke English natively so I could spell better. It got so bad that I would leave my desk around 4pm and work from a different part of the building to prevent management from forcing me to stay late. 

TLDR:
Low pay (salary) 

Insane work hours

No mobility unless you are of Asian descent and willing to literally work multiple 12 hour days 

Terrible communication

","1) A lot of employees who have been at Panasonic for 30 - 40 years who have a lot of experience, however are very set in their ways and defensive when it comes to change.
2) The founders values are shared on business cards and plastered on walls however employees do not follow and people treat each other poorly.
3) Leadership wants employees to act as if it was one centralized organization and decision and alignment is easy but company is very decentralized and working cross-functionally is demoralizing.
4) HR has no backbone when it comes to working with challenging employees at the company. They allow for toxic work environments to fester. Employees who would have normally been out at any other company are allowed to stay and are a turn off for new employees coming in. 
5) For as big as a company Panasonic is in North America, career advancement within the organization is minimal. Entities do not work cross functionally to ensure there are opportunities for high performers and thus people end up leaving.
6) The company has the flexible work program however the culture expects you to never be off

IF he took an active leadership role in the American side of the business like he did in Japan many of he problems would not manifest themselves. Cronyism plays THE dominant role here. IF you are ""liked"" then you will be rewarded. Raises for the rank and file are minimal. The annual review is used as an excuse to weed out he long time employees who are being ""pushed"" out the door after years of dedicated service. The atmosphere is Orwellian in nature.

This has been going on for decades starting when we were in the Pan Am building. (Yes I remember exactly our ""start"".

They are usually late converting people thus making any upward movement take even longer. Just because a person is a temp doesn't mean they are producing substandard items. As temps there is more to prove to keep the job, no holiday pay, and until you are finally converted nothing you did matters. Expected to do more and make less. We all work for Panasonic to create asked for merchandise only to be treated differently or held back because ""technically"" we are just a new hire, even though most temps are in the building @4-6 months before being converted.

*You'll always have to work for 48 hours, but every other month you only get paid for 36 hours because of the odd schedule.

*small raises that feel insulting for the insanely strenuous work we do

*mandatory shutdowns for an entire week for 3 holidays that they will not pay you for. they'll pay you for holidays but thats all you get that week. so basically they cut your weekly pay in half for Christmas with no bonus
Advice to Management
Get rid of the mandatory shutdowns or start paying us for it. We cant be expected to use our PTO for something we don't even want and then only pay us for 1-2 holidays that week. We shouldn't have to suffer during holidays like that.

And fix your payment system so that we aren't putting in 48 hours of hard work and only getting paid for 36 hours every other month. It's so unfair and you are going to lose the last few of your longest standing employees if they don't start receiving better priviliges and fair payment from the company.

Less change management and more change leadership. Panasonic will never compete in the market if products are sitting ready and waiting for the legal team to make a decision. Lean on your full-time employees and quit outsourcing so many things. You are killing morale, creating a toxic culture, and losing valuable people by doing this. Top management appears to encourage change, but there seems to be little real follow through at lower tiers.

2018-07-12, Regional Sales Manager,"Mountain View, CA","Current Employee, less than 1 year","Great company, promising future","Innovative, inclusive culture. 
You’re apart of a global forward thinking company that’s been around for 100 years, with a legacy of leading the world in advanced technologies. 
","dering it’s size, Panasonic does a phenomenal job hiring quality people who are smart, and have a desire for achievement. There is a sense of pride working here. The company is very loyal to its employees— the average tenure is 10.5 years. It’s a very secure, family oriented, Japanese influenced culture. 

There are brilliant people working in this company. The products are top notch. There is excellent engineering and innovative design that goes Into products. 

The most recent restructing of the business units is a great thing, but there are and will be many pains in years to come as things coalesce and take shape.
Cons
It’s a large, global organization, with 250,000+ employees. There’s bound to be bureaucratic, slow moving inefficiencies. 

North American is a separate business from Japan and it’s factories. This can lead to a breakdown in communication and planning and resource exchange. 

As with most big companies, the further up the management chain you go, the less they have any idea how the business runs or should be run.

They have upper management that traverses roles between business units and divisions, often with little knowledge of the new businesses and their product, the market, or the most effective business models for organizing teams and achieving growth. 

As you get higher up the chain, your life becomes more numbers and less about value. It’s more about paperwork than people. 

Unfortunately strategy and goals are set by upper management, and the result is really ineffective strategies with mediocre results. Like shooting into the dark. 

I’m not sure there is a cure for this other than stronger leaders, with stronger visions, with more intimate knowledge of the business domain, and the power the make necessary changes. 

Lots of red tape.

The company is run by accountants, not sales people. Accountants don’t know value. They only understand price. 

This is very bad for a company in the long run. It can cut a companies most important value propositions, and edge over the competition. 

There is a gap between markets and products, and how to make them fit. Marketing is very poor. Products can and often are very very good. 

Sales management overall is poor. They hire great people, and expect them to run a personal business and manage themselves. 

This only works so well.

A company needs a cohesive vision and strategy, so sales, marketing, operations, planning, and product management and development are all aligned. 

Problem is that in a company this large, business resources are shared. This means business processes are forced upon a business unit that operates in a market or industry with vastly different requirements to compete. The result is processes that make no sense and really hinder he ability of the business to grow.

Everyone is great. Most upper management has their hands tied. Their focus should be on customers and sales growth and operational efficiency.... but what ends up happening is that their customers are upper management, and shareholders. So there is a real loss in effective focus and execution. 

The management closest to the guys on the ground have best interests in mind. It’s often a lack of vision and leadership and understanding that starts all the way at the top. 

Overall, great job tho and keep up the great work. 

I think things will work out in the long run!

When you get to know about its presence in Japan it is indeed a heart moving experience. The kind of trust people and its employees have on this company's Brand there in Japan is tremendous. Konusuke Matsushita's Seven Principle is a driving force is a real learning experience for any new comer. During my period lot of money was spent on training its employees at the best universities in the world. You can learn a lot when any company is on an exponential growth trajectory. Working with Japanese staff is a great learning experience and their passion for perfection and eye for details is indeed great.
","To survive in Panasonic India either you need to say only good things about the Indian top management of the company or find ways and means to steal money for them as a subordinate. Then only you can survive in this company. It is my observation that there exists a well netted web of people to syphon money from the organization. They also form more regional bias and sideline certain region employees in India. It is very sad that such a great company established by Matsushita is being swindled by few people here in India consistently.

They have the best corporate culture I have experienced in my 30 years in the workforce. There is no, at least not in my experience, bad mouthing people behind their backs and nasty office politics. People are pleasant, friendly and hard-working. 

Another great plus is, they really value work-life balance. Managers expect you to produce, of course, but not at the expense of your family. And not staying in the office crazy hours to the point where you have no life outside of work. 

Also, there is great flexibility in dealing with personal issues where you may need to leave early or come in a little late. They are very understanding with that sort of stuff and it helps a lot not being stressed if you have a Dr. appt or similar issue.

They are not watching the clock for every minute you come in and leave. Get your work done, meet your deadlines and do your job - and you will be treated like an adult, not a number.

Benefits packages are amazing.
","Once a month paydays and you have to pay for parking in Newark.
Advice to Management
Keep up the visionary work in bringing the company into its next 100 years and out of the consumer electronics era. Keep improving the company culture and making PNA a fun place to work. 

Change payroll schedule to bi-weekly or twice a month. Banks don't pay much interest these days anyway so you're not making money keeping it in the bank an extra two weeks.

Buy the big parking lot behind the building, it will be a good real estate investment. Then charge employees a greatly reduced monthly parking rate.

New management has turned around a floundering division of this high powered company and we have remained profitable for 2 years straight.
","Panasonic does not reimburse for travel expenses at Fair Market Value. A small taxed car allowance does not cover nearly the expenses to keep up a vehicle. The field employees are stuck paying 2/3rds of the expense to build revenue and profits. Current Policy does not allow customer entertainment beyond a standard lunch or dinner. For example customer events such as sports venues or other relationship building activities.
Advice to Management
Repair the issue with travel expenses we have become responsible for since company cars were retracted. The cost to maintain a vehicle in the field is $1,000 minimum on an averaging scale. Vehicle payment for a large enough vehicle to haul equipment, gasoline, oil, insurance, and standard maintenance items such as tires etc is a much higher expense than $400 after taxes car allowance Plus miles only eligible after the car allowance coverage which is subject to taxes.

2. Those who join tend to stay for a very long time and ultimately become close friends.

3. American Senior Management tends to listen.
","1. Salary: probably one of the lowest in the industry. Average Business Development Manager earns $96k base in the NY/NJ Area. Expect to be paid $15 to $20k lower than that.

2. Some are able to adapt to the Japanese culture; some are not. Japanese tend to take good care of those who are able to adapt.

3. Japanese expats who are supposed to be window for Japanese management in Osaka tend to do whatever they are told to do by Japan rather than forewarning them of any negative consequences. This however could be a cultural thing where Japanese do not push back to their superiors unlike Americans, Europeans and Indians.

4. While American Senior management tends to listen, the same is not necessarily true about Japanese Senior management in Osaka. HQ in Osaka has the final say on many things.

- Strong company values
- Benefits
-Stronger leadership in last few years has led to changes that are embracing technology to give employees the tools needed to do their jobs better
- Ability to work from home
- New introduced HR initiatives now allow for clearer designation of career paths (almost non-existent a few years ago)
- Volunteer hours
-tuition assistance
","- Not all divisions in Panasonic are the same, it all depends on your management team.
- Benefits are not quite as competitive as other companies

- No structure for training employees
- Lack of consistency in HR when it comes to evaluating employee performance/growth
Advice to Management
It's clear steps have been taken to usher Panasonic into the future with the new HR initiatives and additional events toward better collaboration. Continuing on this path by following programs that some of the top companies to work for will help push Panasonic further.

","Lower salary than similar places. Albeit my case was kind of special because I did get the job through a recruiter, not directly through their HR system. Of course I had applied for the position on the Panasonic website directly, but nothing happened, no one contacted me. After a while a similar position was advertised by a recruiter reading like this, ""We are looking for an Electronic Technician for our client who is a worldwide Electronic manufacturer ..."". It was a permanent full-time position that I had. Now you may ask why through a recruiter? I have no answer to that question. What was the big HR department doing that for a relatively simple job, they had no time to deal with the candidates directly! I am sure that part of my salary was going to the recruiter monthly, or perhaps the recruiter got a big lump sum when they hired me.

Sales and Engineering get along very well and interdepartmental communication is smooth. Benefits were okay. Fun Christmas party.
","Because I cannot post aggressive or discriminatory language. I'd like y'all to imagine it. This review, it should be noted, reflects only the Mechanical and Electrical Engineering departments. The culture is bad. Asian employees seemed, ironically, to be discriminated against. As it was explained to me, because they are there on work visas, they stand to lose a great deal if they quit or are terminated. Unfair amounts of work are required of them, and strongly suggested (with a threatening glare) of other employees. 
Working 9:00 to 9:00 was expected. I know it sounds like hyperbole, but in all seriousness, twelve-hour days were required except on very rare special occasions. Work is constantly being added. Supervisors are totally cowed by managers, and did very little to defend (me, at least) from managers' reprimands, even in front of customers. Reprimands for falling behind are usually given in the form of brutal, drawn-out meetings or, and I acknowledge the honesty policy when I say this, screaming rants in the middle of the cubicles, in front of everyone. Formal write-ups with a strike system were employed while I was there. People actually wept at their desks.
Advice to Management
You cannot let managers treat people as *literal* indentured servants. That this is not illegal is absolutely horrifying. Salaries are low, and the work is very nearly half again what is required elsewhere. You'll never retain anyone like this. Please be considerate of your entry-level employees, and let them go home. Please, please don't keep managers that are demonstrably inequitable and immature.
