2021-09-20, Software Engineer,Athlone,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",Looks for cheap labour Ericsson Ireland,"- Hires from outside Ireland
- Sponsors visa
- Good work-life balance
- Colleagues are helpful
- If you are lucky you would get to work on latest technologies
","This review is for Ericsson Ireland
- Hires from outside Ireland with low compensation. It's a win-win condition though if you are looking for work permit sponsorship only.
- They don't care about past experiences of the employees. If you are experienced with cutting edge cloud technology, you may get into old monolith application.
- Your career growth also doesn't depend on your past experiences. You may have to learn the legacy technologies again which you probably left 5 years back and have to prove yourself again.
- Promotion is a myth unless you can have good relationship with your manager. You may see other less competent people are getting promoted.
- Compensation is the last thing would like discuss with your friends who works in other companies. You may get half salary than that of your friends but manager will convince you that you are earning above Ericsson standard.
- Because of the above reasons lots of good employees are leaving the company.
- It's getting long, so I'm cutting it down here :)
Advice to Management
- Respect the experience and knowledge of your employees.
- Increase compensation.
- Get rid of the fatty layers in leadership and promote eligible ones.
- I believe you have the quality to retain good people.

2021-09-18, ASIC Developer,"Austin, TX","Former Employee, more than 1 year",Crappy place overall,"Good 401k, Medical and Vacation Benefits.
Lots of vacations to maintain a healthy balance.
","While the overall company has a good culture, Austin site doesn't have the culture what Sweden has. Even though projects have long durations teams struggle to get things done on time, and then politics starts with blame games.
Very bad tools and infrastructure. Every other day you will login and not be able to work as infra would be hung or super slow.
Its more of a bootlicking culture where people who are close to leads get all the career growth.
Teams are technically poor with no understanding of underlying technology, its just blind execution. There is neither depth nor breadth in the work, its about writing some tests, no real development work is there in Austin.
All the technical interesting work stays in Sweden.
Line management is pretty much useless with no technical skills and no drive to improve things. They just write some politically correct emails.
Anyone who is good leaves the place in 6months to about a 1-1.5 years time frame at max.
In short no learning and growth, if you want to kill your career sure come here.

2021-09-15, Senior Solution Integrator,Calcutta,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",Employee Friendly Company,"I have been working now 2 years in Ericsson. The best thing I like about Ericsson is the transparency from management. Be it Bad or Good. They share both. This enhance the confidence of the employees.
The next thing I can speak is about the caring nature of the Company. The top management really values all employees and their wellbeing. During this pandemic they thought about the general challenges faced by us employees for Working From Home. They tried their best to keep us well both physically and mentally. Starting from WiFi Bills to proper furniture for working. Ericsson gave us everything we need.
Work Life Balance is generally there. Though it depends on the customers and Project. But, on long term Yes it is there.
Number of Paid Holidays is one of the best in the industry. As per the Company’s policy you will be entitled to 12 days Casual Leave and 25 days of Privilege/ Earned Leaves. These will be pro-rated in case you join any time during the year. The Company also provides 12 festival / public holidays including national holidays.
If you have to work on any holiday then they pay you 2*Normal day payment. If you need to work on National Holiday then they pay you 3* Normal day Payment. This is a very good policy for cases where we are bound to work on Holidays due to any urgent work.
","Salary Revisions are less for higher Compare Ratio people. Suppose you join Ericsson with already a high package as per your designation then you will get less % appraisals till your next promotion. After promotion you would get good hikes though. But, till then you have to manage with single digit % hikes.
Advice to Management
It would be great if Salary Revisions are bit more for more eligible employees at least even if the Compare Ratio is above 100 %. This would prevent Brain Drain from Ericsson. Please give a serious thought about it.

Instead of laying people off, hire more personnel so deadlines can be met and assign tower crews to certain regions of the state so they can be relatively closer to home and not have to charge for hotels (this will save the company money and allow the tower crew to go home more often to be with family).

There is a job for you somewhere in the company and it's easy to change to totally new roles
","Extremely bureaucratic; can be hard to make an impact in your first few years at the company. Trust is earned, not given from the start.

Diversity is lacking, especially in senior and key tech positions
Advice to Management
Hire in / promote more diversity and, most importantly, when you get the people in, SUPPORT them: help them navigate the complex Swedish cultural rules, set clear expectations on what success looks like in the role, ask them what they need to be successful and realize it may mean breaking the long established organizational rules.

Advice to Management
They won't do for sure but I suggest most of them resign immediately, because most of them only care about how to satisfy their managers without bottom line then pass pressure to line members and seek for next point to please upper management. So these people will give promise to everything requested by upper managers, then fail those tasks (or with much lower quality/quantity results) but without any consequence (refer to cons), and get promoted later because of their goodness at ""execution"".

","1. Pays sub par salary to talented undergraduates which literally destroys their self-esteem. Also if one's exposure is to such a company as a fresher mostly people will go into depression. As many of my friends did. I left the company as soon as the bond period was over. 
2, Before one joins as a fresher they make us sign a bond of 1.5 years with a package of 2.7 Lakhs per annum which is nothing when compared to other companies, even it is below average if you want to make a livelihood as middle class man. 
3. Gruelling shifts of morning, evening and night which literally is inhumane. If you join ericsson just forget about work life balance and anything related to balance may it be physical or mental.
Advice to Management
I literally have no advice because anyways they don't follow advices and just focus on cost cutting. Well, what can we expect from a management which lacks innovation or skills. Instead of making better products they are only focused on cutting costs which increase their profitability. A typical example of Indian managers pleasing their Swedesh countrparts not by doing something constructive but by enslaving their Indian brethren.

","The only thing I did not like about Ericsson is the CTC break up. They deduct gratuity from the salary which is a part of CTC, but do not pay you the gratuity if you leave the company before 4years. Which mean the CTC you are shown in paper is not the actual your are getting.

Managers need to be skilled technically themselves in order to know which employees are good workers and which employees just talk. Too many managers are not skilled enough to understand who is just talking non-sense or repeating what others say.

2021-05-26, Senior Technical Writer,"Gurgaon, Haryana, Haryana","Former Employee, more than 3 years",An Okay Experience Overall,"- Work life balance (though it might vary based on your respective team)

- Product based, so there is relatively higher job safety compared to project-based companies

- Overall professional work environment (atleast superficially)

- Cab and shuttles available

- Annual Product Release parties
","- Vertical hierarchy. Not good chances to take a vertical leap, if you're planning to. Opportunities are less and people are too many. 

- Favoritism is a key role as with any other place. Do not go in with expectations of people being fair to you. Mostly, only people in good books of managers get all big opportunities like onsite trips and all. If you are used to doing only good work, expect yourself to be used as a placeholder more or less. 

- Voice review: There is a voice review where employees get to rate their managers. Although a potentially good tool, still it becomes a pain in all possible areas. Because some select few managers force their teams to rate them 5/5 on every question of the review. Some even take their teams in meeting rooms and force them to fill out the review in person to ensure that they are rated high. If the company wants to utilize the efficacy of this tool, they must ensure the integrity behind it, as well. Be strict and give your employees the leverage to reach out and complain against managers who are forcing them. Managers should be strictly warned, as well.

- Negativity: Though negativity exists everywhere, still it is a different ballgame here altogether. There are very negative people who will compel you to leave the company at earliest. They will poison your ears against job security and what not. Beware of them at all costs. Such people will force you to leave and they will still remain intact at their positions in the company even after 10+ years.

- Visibility can be a big issue if you want to get noticed for your work. Since it's a big company, you will have to do pretty novel things to get the limelight.

- Appraisals are not good. So, if you join, make sure you are joining after a good hike already. Do not expect your salary to increase through appraisals. It's just for the process sake. Hardly anything happens in terms of compensation. 

- Your manager is basically your company here. So, if you have a manager who prefers bootlickers to actual workers, backbiters to straight forward people, ego-massagers to go getters, then you will have a tough time growing. And trust me, when I say, the company is ridden to the core with such people. There are plethora of managers who just want their personal pawns in their teams. If you have such a manager, you will have to play your cards well in order to grow. Because there are many people to ego-massage the manager if you're not willing to. And they are the ones who get all the opportunities, especially the big ones.

- Third party contractors: Do not join on third party payroll unless you have no other option whatsoever. Since managers are given a lot of power in this company, your equation with your manager becomes the most important aspect here. In all honesty, I have observed third party contractors being disrespected and ill-treated several times not just by their own managers but by random people on the floor. Third party contractors are given trouble for very basic things, such as laptops, monitors, keyboards, and others.
Advice to Management
- Be strict against managers who are forcing their employees to rate them high on voice reviews. 

- Employees should be provided with a safe environment where they don't feel threatened or intimidated. Managers take the liberty to insult anyone they like, whenever they like. There are no repercussions, and hence, they continue doing it without inhibitions.

- Managers are given too much power. They should also be monitored accordingly and held accountable for their actions.

- No separation of responsibilities (everyone does everything)
Advice to Management
Take a look at how more successful IT companies do software development. For example how do these more successful companies define and separate responsibilities. In my experience having everyone do everything only results in chaos. It would take an archwizzard to single-handedly do all of the following: agile event orchestration, project administration, feature planning, requirement handling, architecture design, software development, quality assurance, CI/CD, documentation, customer support. Yet this is exactly what is expected from a simple developer at Ericsson.

Advice to Management
Encourage more speaking out and listen to it. Give more opportunity to people who don't fit your mould - break out ... you are diverse in terms of people from different countries and cultures but not in terms of truly encouraging diversity of opinion about strategy and execution. 
There is a lot of lip service to speaking out but in reality it is not appreciated and can hurt career opportunities. You need to 'unbutton'.

There are many:
1. They just talk about work-life balance, you will be next to sugarcane or even worse, they'll SUCK you completely!
2. If you like to work in Brotherhood, you will regret it here one day!
3. Stupid ppl are AMs here In L&D, they know nothing, they do nothing.. But They are just best at licking !! If you aren't a licker the place isn't for you.. 
4. No matter how much you work, if you aren't involved in any project.. You are a ZERO for them even if you doing mountains like BAU.. (the worst part).
5. They will SUCKKKK you completely but will pay pennies and Managers including Head will make you feel like a LOSER when the appraisal month comes closer.
6. Most Importantly Every single person who leaves the company leaves on a BAD NOTE.. it has become a trend now.. You become their enemy as you resign.

- After you've built strong integration skills, you have the opportunity to work on assignments almost anywhere in the world (at least pre-COVID)
- Competitive starting salary
- Weekly/daily Fika (Coffee meetup)
- Coursera/Pluralsight free memberships
","- Telecom in general is super complicated and not easy to understand, people who do understand are always busy and not really open for communication
- Tools are not always the latest
- Skills learnt here might not be transferable other than the telecom sector
- People who have spent a long time here are too comfortable (in general, not all) and are hard to communicate to but this trend is changing gradually as Ericsson is hiring a lot of young skilled people lately

2021-03-02, Problem Manager,,Current Employee,Too many senior managers,"Pay is good for the role, and for the location. Benefits and reward systems are also pretty good.
","Each unit seems to have 1000 senior managers and only two people who actually do the work. Too many senior managers all wanting to only attend meetings give their opinions and dish out tasks. 
The company is also extremely reluctant to hirer new people even where the need may be crystal clear. Easy to get overworked while someone else gets a pat in the back for successfully cutting down budget costs. Have seen the best and most hardworking employees chased out of the company because of this (they cannot get support) leaving behind only the lazy ones who have already given up on the company.
Advice to Management
Whoever is is charge of allocating budget for new hires should have a one-on-one chat with the engineers who actually do the job (not the team leaders who sometimes have no idea what is going on). Don't punish the handworkers for being hardworking until you eventually drive them all out of the company. I have seen the best employees leave because of this, you will be left with the lazy ones who have already given up on any efficiency in the company.

- Managers inspire to take on different certifications
- Very flexible work hours
- Not so much of mental pressure from management
","- Employees with lesser experience are sometimes hired for a senior post
- Pressure of taking on different certifications are sometimes too much to handle specially with the ongoing project goals
- Employeses are rarely awarded for their performance in projects due to lack of transparency between project managers and higher management.
- Salary revisions are often given on average basis, not performance-wise.
Advice to Management
- Employees contributing towards achieving company goals should be awarded.
- Scrutiny of employee performance should be implemented.
- To boost morale, promote some existing employees rather than hiring new employees with lesser experience for a senior post.

","Some managers have absolutely no skills related to people management. There is no transparency related to their decisions. There is no work volume quantification. The vacation days are approved only if you find another colleague willing to do your work also, while you are in vacation. At least this happens in Romania.
Advice to Management
Try to be opened to the problems raised by the team. It is absurd to work in a great Swedish company where line managers impose a North Korean atmosphere. If a manager receives a bad review in the Voice survey from multiple persons, try to have a one to one discussion instead of a all team meeting, because you will get more details and information in a private discussion.

.Job security is always a big concern as so called leaders are inept ,insecure losers.
.It's more of a family shop where - there is no accountability ,transparency or meritocracy .
.Terrible leadership like some gangster style group targeting people for being smart and open about their opinions.
.Have never heard or come across such weak set of people who are just cowards and insecure from intelligent people.
.Plus there is non quality work as almost all of the first batch of talented employees quit the team GAIA as I said they were bright ,intelligent and talented.
.To top it all there is a top guy in Blore (polished on exterior) who behaves like he is some sort of old king or slave owner and he actually has 3 slaves in reality in the firm and they just follow his whims and stupidities.

2020-12-26, Vice President,"Plano, TX","Former Employee, more than 5 years",Depends on where you work,"Strong benefits for US, very international culture, influential company. 5G will provide growth in the Networks division for some time.
","Significant pay, rank disparities across company. Very easy in the US if you are on a Visa or are a woman to make significantly less than your peers. And the upper management is predominantly white, male, and Swedish. They are working hard to fix the gender disparities, but there is resulting age discrimination. And there is great job mobility if you start in Europe, but higher US wages reduce your options if you start there. If you are not in the Networks side of the business, you are not in a healthy business and are at risk.
Advice to Management
There are 10M people in Sweden. Half of those are men. Let's say 80% of them are white and 20% of the rest have at least a bachelors degree. That is a global talent pool of 800K for leadership positions in a company with 110K employees. It is bananas that you have not fixed this by 2020. There is no way that the shareholders are being served well by this restricted talent pool.

2. Poor middle management. Product managers earn a lot of money not knowing what's actually going on in development, not all of them though like this but some of them seem to be unprofessional especially in the management. Probably they were a good developers but they are not good managers.
3. Everything is very slow, quite bad processes inside some parts of the company.

Worst time management and shifts I have ever seen. Egoistic Managers. I have seen in my 1.5 Years of working with Ericsson - more than 32 Resignations and reason can be self-explained if you are planning to join this office.
No promotions until you give your more than 5 years and that too is luck depends on how much you praise and gossip with your manager and lead about your colleagues.
Work Likf balance is null.
Advice to Management
Take action and check the skills and the educational abilities of your managers who know even less than their team they are running. try to communicate with your junior employee's monthly basis and see if they are facing any issues with their egoistic superiors or not.

Everywhere I went I found structured processes guiding the activities and projects, training plans, career paths and welcoming offices (people and premises). Ericsson gives a wide range of career development opportunities, it's much up to the employee to catch them!
","IN the recent years many employees had to leave their job in the Company and this gave a slightly bad light to the company, in general. The decisions taken on who to keep onboard have not always been taken wisely causing, sometimes, very negative impacts on ongoing activities. While in the past (until 2015) the Company was very attentive to people as individuals, afterwards it became considering people more as numbers for the sake of the head count reduction. This was a big disappointment especially for the ""old"" employees

Opportunities to learn
Opportunities to grow
Good company culture
Diverse work
You can most probably work there until you retire, no fear of firing/layoffs.
","Lower salary
Disorganized management/leadership
The higher you go, the more politics you encounter.
Your salary increase is based on your current salary, +10% per year is exceptional. If you go there as a student then eventually you will be underpaid if you don't lobby for a more significant salary increase.
Advice to Management
Hire more seniors.
Delegate project leadership on highly skilled or high potential developers/architects instead of overloading some people.
Specify less goals. Focus on the most important ones. Keep this up in the future.
Don't reorganize so much.

Terminate the matrix management. Line managers are not needed at all. Pushing scrum is not solves everything. Improve your technical knowledge, and you will be able to manage a project.

","If you are joining as a fresher then please run away because they will only offer you support work and no career growth , if you dare them to ask for some development work which I have done the. Your entire team will start conspiracy against you and then they will give bad reviews about your work and your hike and appraisal will be hampered , so after joining you have to search for God father. 

Second thing , some people in leadership team are behaving that they pay the employees from their pocket , they can put you on very miserable position and you will be left with no other option inspite of leaving the organisation.

I faced the same, every Line manager used to have a spy who will listen and take part in all kind of discussion and they update the same to Line manager on monthly basis. So beware , if your line manager or project manager is from other location but don't think that they are not getting informed.

Chai and cigarette, one who offer mudi , chai and cigarette will definitely get a high favour than anyone else.

If some girl is beautiful then believe me within 3 year she will be your manager or in a manager like position

Since March I have been using my personal vehicle to get to sites. The sites a 3 hrs out of market. I have climbed 2 towers a day and still made a 3 hr trip to return home. NO HOTEL was offered!! Down in TX they scream SAFETY but in reality, the management just wants faster completions. I have been hit with 2 “reasonable suspicion” drug tests, in which I passed both. Honestly Ericsson is good for the money.

In kolkata location , its like no work only gossip and time pass . So if you are in your 40s then you can enjoy here
","ahh!! 1) Politics (disastrous)
 2) leadership people think that they own everyone .
 3) work credit will only be given to manager or lead . 
 4) very low salary hike but they have the budget to party on 5 star hotels 
5) My entire batch resigned within 2 years (mostly boys) I survived 3+ years due to patience . I don't know but every new joinee specially boys are considered as threat to managers and lead they start bullying them.
6)All show no go : Big PPT slides , even bigger roadmap but in reality they don't know where to start
7) unprofessional attitude of seniors : one who offers cigrattes or biryani usually get an edge over any hardworking employee
8) They will make you believe you are worthless
9) For shift allowances and holiday payout : Employess are fighting among themselves like rats and dogs

In short , If you really want to learn and grow and build a strong carrier never join Ericsson's kolkata location . Even if you have already done the mistake , build up your domain , make a strong CV and leave!!!

2020-02-07, Data Scientist,Kista,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",Just bad,"Work-life balance, a lot of free time
","Terrible ways of working. Everything is so slow, people compete with each other and ignore each others work in the same time. They try to invent a wheel over and over again. You will find little respect and little recognition, especially if you are young or if you are a woman and I suspect many other if's. Lack of management, and management is overall not qualified for such positions, managers are selected internally and usually people apply for management positions for a slightly better salary after being a researcher or engineer and having no interest in managing people. 

Top-management and employees are in two different worlds, people don't speak up here and don't have a right to be heard. They work here because they have kids, loans, cars and no will to take control of their life. They do patents for every sneeze, they are professional in creating nothing out of nothing. 

No work and no interesting projects. There are people working here for 20 years and they are completely brain-washed. They can sit and smile when everything is falling apart around them saying ""Guys, we are doing great!"".

Confortable environment.
","Poor or no recognition for excellent work. 
Very low salaries, cost of living in Ireland is very high and the salaries doesn't keep up. 
All the products have very complex implementation, commonly over-engineered. Poor reuse of industry standard technologies, it has a tendency of creating things from scratch involving a lot o people with no experience.
Difficult to deal with many veteran staff, they have inflated egos and very frequently bad arguments, poor social skills, terrible leadership abilities. This includes senior engineers, master engineers and managers. 
Excess of bureaucracy for developing software. Agile is a facade that everyone pretends that is working fine.
Advice to Management
The turn over is extremely high because the company is terrible in recognizing people's work and potential. All the good employees that I know have left the company because of the low salary and the frustrated relationship with their line managers.

","Ericsson USA has lost its shine since mid 2011. They were under pressure to cut costs through offshoring. Engineers and solution architects were hired from India for fraction of the cost. As a result layoffs took place in the US especially when Ericsson’s profitability was questioned in 2017-2018. The Indian employees transferred to the US. Therefore, the company is now another Indian company with little to no Swedish influence. If you decide to join, do your homework of understanding what it is like to work in an Indian culture.

","Extremely bad pay, little to no job progression prospects, your experience there will greatly depend upon the manager(s) you have, when it's good, it's good but when it's bad, it's really bad
Advice to Management
Some of your managers have extremely high turnover, there's a reason for that. Listen to your employees when they report things. Investigate how employees with high reviews year in, year out suddenly get bad reviews and get put on personal performance plans which are basically a construed step to firing an employee that the manager doesn't like. Some manages are awesome but boy does 5 years going down the drain suck. Worked out for me and at least ten other employees in the same boat though, so I really should be grateful. Thanks!

2019-10-18, ICT Engineer,"Stockholm, Stockholm, Stockholm","Current Employee, more than 5 years",Engineering Cloud - the constant overcast,"There is a potential to work on really cool challenges - but be prepared to meet resistance.

Working in an R&D environment with 10.000's of users look really good on the CV
","The culture of indifference. ""We've always done it this way"", could be the motto for the GIC program. Unsurprisingly this has led to a mess of an environment.

I think that a lot of it can be tracked down to skilled people leaving the company, and I think I will join them soon. Left are the people that doesn't really care. That doesn't bother to read up on how to solve an issue properly. That doesn't want to learn configuration management best practices.

The out-sourcing of work to TCS definitely hasn't helped either. For anyone who has worked with them, or similar companies, it may not come as a surprise that you suddenly find yourself interacting mostly with ""Senior Engineers"" or ""Experts"" with a complete lack of understanding of what they are doing, trying their best to keep up a facade.
Advice to Management
I think that R&D IT needs a major culture change. Management needs to recognize that consistently ignoring industry best practices is going to have consequences. I believe that Ericsson at a company right now is in a position where it will have a hard time to retain skilled engineers.

There may be an opportunity to start transformations after the migrations are done. Make sure that smaller teams can deliver clearly defined services, and that service interfaces are clearly defined.

I kind of hate to say it, but start implementing ITIL - the chapter of the ITIL book describing the problems it's supposed to solve is like reading a textbook on Ericsson.

This office epitomizes the 90 -10 rule. 10% of the staff or less does any of the work while the rest are allowed to show up late or not at all and do little to no work. This office needs a total makeover from staff and management. TOXIC culture that does not allow growth or upward movement. Instead of addressing problems, they bring in old staff that just continue to repeat the same way of working that no longer works. This company does not allow any work life balance if you are one of the few that are expected to work. Also, when I left the company, they withheld my last paycheck and I had to wait 3 days until the regular pay period to be paid. I was also not allowed to have an exit interview with HR.
Advice to Management
Change of management and real change of culture is needed. Stop disrespecting staff and allow for movement to other business and customer units. Have a manager that is actually in the office for the site acquisition staff and have a manager that actually cares about people not just his few friends.

2019-08-31, Developer,"Stockholm, Stockholm, Stockholm","Former Employee, less than 1 year",Shambolic and inefficient. Poor technical capability at every level.,"The work ethic is non-existent. If you want to work as little as possible, take sick leave every week and take home a fairly small pay-cheque, then Ericsson is for you.

Expectations are low. If you're not academically strong or motivated, then this won't hold you back at Ericsson.
","The work ethic is non-existent. If you want to work hard, learn, improve and be recognized for your efforts, then don't even consider Ericsson.

Salary ""increases"" are pathetic. Despite 100% superb feedback from everyone I worked with, I received a salary increase below inflation (effectively a pay cut).

Technical competence is extremely low. The bar for entry is very low, so Ericsson is full of people with weak academic backgrounds and very low technical capability. If you value working with (and learning from) smart people, then you will be frustrated at Ericsson. This also brings the issue that if you have high technical competence, then you will not be recognized because no one really understands what you have done.

Ericsson brings big-company inefficiency to a whole new level. People are always too busy to do any work. Technical issues (that completely halt development for entire teams of developers) are a very regular occurrence. Every seemingly small task takes a ridiculous amount of time to pass through all the layers of bureaucracy. There is absolutely no collaboration between teams, so development effort is repeated over and over again. Technical documentation is always: unnecessarily long, out of date (or just incorrect), unclear, incomplete and lacking the few necessary details.
Advice to Management
Expect more from your employees. Fire the 80% that are contributing nothing (or less than nothing). Don't be so afraid to change processes that are completely failing. Have a plan. Target inefficiency. Work much harder to employ people with stronger technical competence. Use those people to increase competence among their colleagues. Throwing money at training courses doesn't work.

Business Outlook
Pros
Plenty of time off.
Cons
Always felt the overwhelming sense of doom. When I started my team was 20+ people. There were cuts after the first few months, and they kept coming regularly again and again. After a while, our learning clients gave up caring about learning because they were so worried for their job. 
The former CEO ran things into the ground by dreaming but never bringing it to realization. Thousands of people get laid off and he still gets a cushy top level job and doesn't suffer.

- Very friendly people, good team spirit
- There is always someone who's willing to help you solving your problem
- Super flexible work time, you don't have to be there exactly 8 hours (including lunch break) as long as you get your job done (and unfortunately, even if you don't)
- Lunch break is 20 minutes long officially, but almost everyone takes an 1 hour break
- We work in Agile and Scrum, our team has free hand making technical decisions
- They are also more than happy for feedback and improvements for our tools
- Lots of opportunities to learn (internal and external courses, conferences, etc.)
- Continuous feedback
- Possibility to travel to other countries for some weeks (depending on the project)
- Relatively good location (Infopark)
- Pretty strong company laptop that you can also take home
- Once in a year big team building (~50 ppl, one night in a (usually) wellness hotel)

Overall it's a very good place as a first company.
","This is literally the place where if you want to work you work, if not, you don't.
- No really, you can get away being in the office 7 hours per day (including a 1 hour lunch break and 2 * 1 hour coffee breaks)
- Some people with higher job grade do literally nothing all day, then getting promoted to scrum masters/POs/managers
- Hard to get a decent salary if you work already here
- They rather hire new people than giving actually decent salary for the talented people
- There is a 30% women target, and some are only hired or not yet fired because of this
- The canteen in the building has horrible quality and some of the staff are pretty rude
- You can only get your free 25dkg salad (or 2 fruits, and you better wash those fruits) in this canteen
- The laptop and the ""docker"" quality (HP) is pretty bad, for many people the USB and HDMI ports die after half year
- If you choose Windows 10 for your laptop, it's full of spywares and crappy ""antivirus"" software which make development slow and randomly mess up your git/python/npm environment
- The equipment in the meeting rooms don't work if you have Linux, but at least usually there is a HDMI cable

Other
The office building was obviously designed by some inexperienced Swedish person who has no idea about the summer heat (or basic physics):
- The ""automatic intelligent shutters"", which are between the two glass panels(!) were an epic failure:
-- They move ridiculously slowly
-- Literally half of them broke in 2 months and could be only ""fixed"" by replacing the entire panels
-- After this they decided to disable the automatic movement
-- They ended up adding a second line of ""curtains"" (because the original ones were useless)
- During super hot and humid days, water is dripping from the air conditioners from the ceiling to our desks, for what the ""solution"" is to turn them off
Advice to Management
Do not hire people who don't do their job, or at least fire them in the first 3 months (yes, they didn't work that even during the trial period and no one cared) or at least don't promote them FFS.
Give decent salary for talents, don't wait until they threat you with quitting.
Some more benefits would be nice like more money for small team buildings or free snacks/drinks in the office.
The laptops with Windows 10 are literally unsuitable for decent development in this shape.

2019-06-30,Anonymous,Athlone,"Former Employee, less than 1 year",Stay away,"Good breakfast at cafeteria. And free coffee.
","They don't tell u which department u will land up in. I was in A3. 

This was shared on the first day and highlighted again and again :

Office times : 9:00-17:30 - including 2 x 15min breaks (morning/afternoon) and 30mins for lunch.

If you are not in the office for any reason, you must notify your manager (XXXX XXXXX) by phone, as is company policy. Failure to do this is a disciplinary issue. Take down my number xxx xxxx xxx and save it in your phone.

See the tone - this is a disciplinary issue. I guess they forgot this is not a factory anymore.

Every engineer/colleague I spoke to said managers track what time they start day, how long they are away from desk and what time they leave. Some of them even join stand-ups. 

If u are 15min late, then u are taken into a room and told off. They even try to listen in on what u are talking to others.

Some of the engineers say they feel as if managers have camera planted or they ask other managers to keep an eye on u. Most of them said, they would quit soon because of the managers. No one will complain about this to HR or in exit interview because they feel senior management expects this from their managers. Some of the managers are notoriously famous and not in a good way.

Also, apparently it is very difficult to change teams and get into other department (unless managers wants u gone) or go against the wishes of ur manager. Unless u want to get in trouble. Managers are all powerful and have no clue about technology or people management.

Thanks goodness I was with Ericsson-Athlone only for 2 months. Even in those 2 months I was taken into a room every week. 

My advice – Stay away. If not, make sure not to join A3.

Introduce performance and behavior (follow company values) evaluation on all management level. Main indicators to be evaluated should be subordinate engagement and motivation + performance, effectiveness of the organization + the improvement of all of them.
All high level managers should take care and ensure that they have and select good subordinate leaders + develop them further. Otherwise this company is only one of the other mediocre companies with full on bad managers.

no opportunity to move up, training is very hard to get/find
Playing games during downsizing, forced resignations if you don't: move, if you don't stay to train your offshore replacements, take a position with a contractor, setting long or extended time windows final layoff date (hoping you will leave sooner without severance)
watching your friends and coworkers constantly being let go

","As an employee that worked in different Ericsson sites, I can say Ericsson Bellevue - WA works as a separate company, not following ericsson's values.
Work-life balance at this site is simply nonexistent. Managers treat you like you are doing something wrong if you are working from 8 to 5. And when we talk about managers, note that this place has a HUGE number of managers, almost one manager for each 2 employee and they still try to figure out why the company is facing a financial crisis.
Managers treat employees like garbage, it is normal to hear around the office managers swearing bad words with employees or even laughing at failures. It is a very toxic place. 
Note: I only experienced it at Ericsson Bellevue - WA. The company it self is great! If you can chose, run from Bellevue!

","Learning wise its heaven but if you talk about salary growth than in that case you have to feel bad because the salary rise is very poor, you will get around 9-10 % salary increment only if you are best in your work but if you are good/average at your work you have to satisfy with 3-4% only.

2019-01-17, Project Manager,,"Former Employee, more than 8 years",Large Company and all of the attendant issues,"Ericsson is an established global telecom leader. As such, it offers many benefits including myriad job functions, departments, and a presence in nearly every conceivable location. Opportunities to work with every nameplate technology company abound, as do options for career paths.
","The downside to a company of Ericsson's size and the nature of its desire to expand from its primary function (telecom equipment manufacturer) is that it ends up trying to be all things to all partners.

Unfortunately, Ericsson is a victim of its own success. It grew quite large on its reputation as a manufacturer of excellent telecommunications equipment, and has attempted to leverage that success by expanding into all areas of the ICT space. By nature, the company is good at just a few things, but is trying to participate in literally hundreds of things (managed services, cloud infrastructure, consulting, etc.) Inevitably, this leads to disappointed customers and frustrated Ericsson employees.
Advice to Management
Management should stop making all focus on the margin, and instead turn their attention to delivering quality products and services that set the standard in the marketplace. 

Consistently attempting to drive cost out of the business by offshoring critical frontline functions while increasing overhead in disposable centralized roles is a recipe for dysfunction.

Fair and inclusive culture. Plenty of opportunities for who is willing to explore and go the extra mile. Leading influencing company worldwide on certain sectors.
","Generalizing, middle-high leadership layers may not be inspiring for lack of either ability to look outside the already visible corporate-horizon or of their poor curriculum of successful accomplishments for the company, leaving the impression that the company is not that result oriented when it comes to that range of leadership levels. Culturally not used to handle with clarity difficult interpersonal situations can be a loss of leadership charisma for some. The company seems to fall behind the minimum of industry practices in certain management methods (project, line). Methods and tools used to manage topic widely used in the industry (agile, SW development phases, IT management, Project Management, reporting ...etc) seemed to need to be rediscovered every time a new player enter into the picture. While challenging the way it was always done can be good on occasions, questioning the processes and methods before giving them a try is definitely adding cost.
Advice to Management
Appoint leaders at every level communicating clearly their curriculum of accomplishments (success stories), in the same manner this is already done for top executives.

It allowed me to see the world and work in many different positions.
Its culture is very consistent in all those offices.
Ericsson is also the undisputed market leader in radio and that is what always funded the other company growth areas.
","Ericsson has been unsuccessful in making headway on the wireline side of the business and has year after year lost more territory to players like cisco. Also their attempts to grow into datacenters and IT has been a failure.
Ericsson is also burdened by a massive internal IT organisation adding a lot of overhead to the bottom line and slowing down innovation.

","Lots of middle management, So that adds to non-billable resources overhead. There are lot of Directors, Project Managers, Program Managers, Technical Managers, Solutions Architect I, II,III,IV (With very less technical competence, kiss goodbye to functional competence)... Unfortunately less engineer who perform the actual work. For the past 3-4 years, the trend is after any acquisition ,new group (with their own family and friends) comes over with hefty package and takes over looming uncertainty. Lot of departments are bleeding, with unreasonable wish list & promises to customer. (Reason refer above)
Advice to Management
Cut down the non billable resource, Get rid of thick middle management, Hire Engineers, Promote only engineers with sound, technical & functional knowledge as Solutions Architect or higher up.

2018-08-02, Financial Analyst,"Southampton, England, England","Former Employee, more than 1 year",Financial Analyst,"The people at Ericsson Television were fantastic, whether it was just a friendly chat or in a meeting, they were always willing to help and very friendly. These people were people you could go for a beer with anytime and have a great time. The working environment was very engaging and friendly, with a weekly football kick around happening weekly. For those who didn't like playing, there was always the fantasy which encouraged everyone to get together and talk about something they enjoy! The work I completed there was in depth and of great importance. The reports I produced went around the world and being given that responsibility was quite rewarding! There were opportunities to get into other parts of finance and learn more about processes which was great! The cooked breakfast was fantastic and reasonably priced.
","During my time there, one downside was that within finance, there wasn't as much to do. You'd do the monthly and weekly reports but apart from that, there wasn't much to do.

","A career waster, A financial waster, hopeless environment with bunch of poltician act as managers or at any higher position. No real time projects, company is re-structuring policy every quarter so as to stand in market somehow. But as a matter of fact is failing. Attrition is high. Managers are beutiful women centric mostly. Which horrible to digest but a reality. Management has no fixed policies on promotion or hike. It goes well favourable persons. I strongly suggest to avoid this horrible company to join. Now adays even they don't pay the full ctc. The bonus always skipped saying company is going through tough situation. However propaganda mail often comes company's self proclaimed success. Again i do not recommend this company.
Advice to Management
Don't waste peoples valuable finite career saying some repeated self proclaimed advertisement of world's 40% traffic is handled by ericsson, Bluetooth and all. Change yourself as to see good comments some day. Change your policies. Face the reality that it is known to a majority that ericsson global india is a total career waster. Change those lazy and proud people who come by audi or mercedes and in reality hasn't have even ability to bring few good quality projects.

Advice to Management
One understands the financial crisis but HR and management should take up layoffs based on performance. HR should also listen to employee than manager when layoffs are so frequent. Line Manger saves his favorite team member but other engineers who are travelling for work cannot be with line manager and therefore cant be their favorite. HR should listen to Project managers than line manager because line managers are simply non-technical people who have no idea how the team member is performing.

Cons
THe business itself is not going anywhere. As a two decade veteran of the High tech Industry with over 12 years in the video business, E/// does not have the DNA to be a video business. It is a set of telco geeks who are trying their hand at the video busienss in a completely incoherent fashion. E/// went on a shopping spree to buy their way into the video marketplace in 2014-1016 but they never integrated the pieces into one coherent product offering. The Video hierarchy is headed at the top 4 layers with telco people with precious little understanding of the video business and neither the contacts in the video business. So in my view the long term success of the Video business is very unlikely.

2. No vision for future of the company. It is right now in a state where it seems to not have much capital to invest in something new. All of the investment made in previous years, did not pay back the expected return. All bets are given to 5G with fingers crossed and eyes shut!
3. Decision are made, with no risk analysis of what could go wrong.
4. Decisions are made from Sweden, and Ottawa being a remote site does NOT have a 'say' to change those decisions.
5. Too much politics within the management and sometimes within employees.
6. Very few of the managers are complete awful! They should not be given that position at all . All they need is a ""Yes man!"" mindset of people.
7. Hiring mechanism is broken. As long as you can type, and are human, you are ""in"".
8. Within Canada, Ericsson has lost the reputation to get new grads and experienced engineers from reputable universities. It has become more of a ""training ground"" where you learn and leave as soon as possible. 
9. No stock options.
10. Free parking is given as a perk !
11. Company is doing too much of cost cutting, for that, they are loosing some of the basics in keeping this ship sane.
12. Raise are given based on ""visibility"" among the management.
13. Morale of employee is all time low.
14. Age difference between new grads and experienced is getting big. Time to say hello to your grandparents.
15. Whole company is slow. Not agile.
16. Telecom space is becoming a ""Dinosaur technology"", so for new grads it does not interest much. 
17. Company is not evolving as fast as the market around. 
18. Not a market leader in telecom space anymore.
17. There is a growing population of seniors who are near to retirement, that were hired at the time of Nortel, and the management is not doing anything to train to replace them.
18. A small number of the managers do not know the difficulties of developers. They would just say things, literally anything to sound 'technical', use you for their selfish agenda, not because it is helping the company but because each manager has to show something, that they are doing ""something"". A , classic out of the book, good-old narcissist.
Advice to Management
Listen to your employees! You have received feedback in many forms (either through company wide survey, individual feedback and/or through people leaving the company). Don't just pass on the problem like a hot potato, pay heed to the raised issues and not just mark them as fixed only for ""book-keeping"" purposes, and to show to the upper management ""how good you are in solving problems""!

Pros
When you are there they have decent benefits. (Or used to) Decent work life balance - at least in the groups I was in. Being South Asian is a big plus to working there. The new CEO seems to be turning things around, but E will never be the 800 lb gorilla again.
Cons
From the time I started in 2012 - it was a continual stream of downsizing in North America. Loss loss loss. Ericsson lost it's market leadership due to hubris and bad decisions. The morale was extremely low when I left. Stay a year or two then start looking for another job before they cut you. Don't get complacent.

Listen to any hints or allegations of nepotism among management. Employees that add real value and merit that suffer under these unqualified managers will find somewhere else to go should the occasion arise. Usually people don't leave good companies, but they will leave incompetent and unqualified managers. Hopefully Ericsson can thrive once again if 5G truly flourishes to 20-30 Billion connected devices but, in the meantime, there will be some rough patches through this decade and beyond. Therefore, I would be hard pressed to recommend this company to a friend.

Not much in carrier path. Very complex processes and procedures to achieve simple goals. Low value of employees as a company assets. Money is the first , people are second. For two- three managers working one engineer. Using cheap R&D outsource causing loose competition with rival companies.
Advice to Management

Working at the forefront of the evolution of communication industry.
An organization that can manage absolutely wonderful things on small and large scale.
","The following are issues that popped up the last 2-3 years. Before that Ericsson was definitely a place where you could happily work your entire working life with a constant flow of engaging challenges.

But lately many parts of the company went into ""panic mode"". The Change of CEO (to Borje Ekholm) lead to a completely new top layer of managers, which is understandable. But they then continued to swap out almost all manager below them etc, leaving the company with a large number of managers started to drive changes that were not in line with what the CEO was communicating. I witnessed/suffered with senior managers that kept changing directives on weekly basis for an entire year, and stopped listening to input. But that was only one part of Ericsson. Big reductions in staff were done in parts of the business that was extremely profitable (instead of concentrating reductions or selling off parts where the problems actually were).
Advice to Management
You need to look the people sitting between the CEO and the department managers. The great vision of the CEO is currently lost as it ends up in initiatives further down in the organization, and it is in my mind hurting the company a lot.

Pressurizing your employee will do you no good 
Try to bring in business
Try to work with new technologies, the technology used here is at least 10 years old
Reuse you already made solution rather than developing the solution from scratch.

2018-03-05,Anonymous,Bangalore,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",Worst Management,"Never start your career with this company. 
Freshers are being treated as slaves.
There are no pros to write about this company.
Absolutely nothing.
","Every single thing about the company. 
Very bad choice to start a career with this company. 
I’m writing this to know all the college pass outs out there to make a wise decision by not joining this company.
The work sucks. It is equivalent to a call centre job. 
Managers and the management sucks. You will be mentally harassed. And there are senior people who support such a misconduct.
There is no difference between the work assigned to you and the other team members( senior engineer , specialist). The only difference is GETs and the engineers will be paid less. 
Most important point to note, you will not be given any hike during the 1st appraisal and this applies to certain departments only and also there is no variable pay.
You will be paid below the industry standards.
All the above applies to the freshers. 
For Freshers, who are reading this review consider this as my personal suggestion - ""Never join this company in case you have been recruited on campus”.
No hygiene is maintained in the canteen.
Work will be done by the GETs and the engineers and all the credits are taken by the managers.
Managers are very inefficient and Egoistic. They get the work done by blackmailing the employees.
And will preach about workplace ethics.
Advice to Management
This company doesn’t deserve even 1 star rating but couldn’t rate it low.
Given an option I would rate it “0”.
What is the point in advising when no actions will be taken, just a waste of time and words.
For people who are working at Ericsson, Quest for easy is of no use. Things which are broken will remain broken at this place or it might worsen. I don’t find any positive vibe for improvements at this place.

2018-02-03, Engineer,"Ottawa, ON","Former Employee, more than 5 years","Lowest salaries, excessive unpaid work, sweatshop layout","Co-workers are nice, but most frustrated and looking to leave so the moral isn't good. Ericsson
","- lowest salary (also does not negotiate/budge on lowball offers. ie. take it or leave it attitude).
- No benefits. Other companies pay health (US), free drinks, free food, pension contributions, given RSUs/stock. Ericsson has none of that!
- Ericsson advertises ""free parking"" as a perk because they don't have any perks. (parking is free everywhere around Ericsson Ottawa so it's not a perk).
- Lots of unpaid work after hours & weekends. Don't expect appreciation or compensation. They just don't care.
- Agile meetings daily to micro-manage you.
- Terrible HR. Ericsson HR is your enemy and only there to force you to take their lowball offer and 
- Ericsson HR in Texas makes changes/decisions to Ericsson elsewhere (Ottawa for example) like turning Ottawa into a sweatshop layout and dynamic seating. Turns out HR doesn't have a clue how engineering work (go figure) and now people are constantly sick due to the sweatshop layout which seats 6 people 2 feet from each other with no divisions. Noise is a problem. People wear headphones and earplugs to drown out the noise. Dynamic seating was abandoned. HR still won't admit they screwed up big time.
- People leave. Company is bleeding.
- Huawei has surpassed Ericsson and Ericsson is on track for bankruptcy.
- Virtual teams means you are 50% in one team under one virtual manager and 70% under manager. 50%+70% adds up to more than 100%. Smart aren't they!!
- Some workers are getting away with doing nothing. A kid in my team came in a 11am and left a 2-3pm each day. Others commit a line of code once every couple of weeks, but they first submit garbage work and the reviewers have to tell them out to fix it so that it doesn't crash the products. So essentially they contribute nothing.
- Directors are pretty useless.
- Excessive meetings (Some people like this because they use meetings as excuses to never do any work).
- Ericsson as most companies in the Kanata Tech park only exist due to cheap obedient foreign labor. 
- Ericsson and other Kanata tech park companies produce more dual citizenships than actual product. (ie. Citizenship Manufacturing is the primary product).
- Canada needs to cut back on immigration.
- Canada needs to cut back on mass graduation. At this time there are not enough blue collar workers as witnessed by the rise of blue collar workers salaries well above normal and the stagnation of Engineering salaries (decline if inflation is factored in).
Advice to Management
- Fire hr and let Engineering Managers make decisions.
- Pay wages that will help retain talent instead of always trying to hire foreigners and beg to gov of Canada to flood the STEM marker to create an artificial employer's market and suppress wages. (in other words, let the market set wages instead of politicians, execs, hr trying to decide what they think they should pay you - the envy, jealousy that hr and politicians have toward STEM is very apparent and shows in the decision to artifically set market rates while giving over fields, like the pulbic sector workers, doctors, etc raises)
- If Ericsson is unable to pay, they can always look for less qualified workers such as high school grads, 2 year college grads. That all Ericsson seems to want to pay for (can afford).
- Management needs to gain an appreciation for good work/talent and try to attract it. Low-balling doesn't work. The difference between Silicone Valey and crap-ttawa is this understanding in the Valey that Engineers are your future and good Engineers are worth every penny you invest. Crap-ttawa only wants to slave-drive low paid Engineers into producing for a couple years at low rates until the Engineer realizes its not worth it. No wonder crap-ttawa never poduced anything, despite having floods of bright, ultra-talented Engineers that Silicone Valey is stealing away constantly.

Pros
Well stated corporate culture and values 
Great hard working employees at the execution level
Generally very collaborative
Cons
No defined strategy or integration / alignment between consulting and solutions, with limited understanding of the difference between Management consulting, consultative selling, and systems integration consulting.
Stated values are poorly executed by middle management, to the extent of being almost meaningless (state one thing, abandon in day to day actions) 
Lacks dynamism and innovation 
Continued issues with poor product functions and capabilities 
Services business is purely cost recovery utilization driven
Pays lip service to professional and career development
Managerial and leadership capabilities of employees are not identified or developed well 
Continued organization design changes, and turnover of middle managers contributes to poor execution, and lack of commitment
Advice to Management

Create an agile and adaptable end to end collaborative organization design, which is more attuned to the needs of customers, not vertical silos of dysfunctional technical go to market delivery units

Outdated tech stack.
Complete lack of interest in career planning & career development of employees - people are reshuffled between unrelated roles at will regardless of their current skillset, interests and wishes - you could be a manager one day, and a developer the next with little to no say in the matter.
Lack of transparency in career progression & pay.
Meaningless yearly performance review process - irrelevant copy/pasted goals; scores that don't line up with the actual written feedback; scores have minimal impact on compensation.
Lack of communication with management - some employees only get 1 or 2 chances for a face-to-face session with their direct manager a year.
Excessive amount of red tape - over-reliance on meetings without clear goals and purpose; everything is a word document or a powerpoint presentation (often both); every team is a Scrum team, regardless of how well it fits.
Low standard of internal developer documentation - work with internal tools and libraries is an exercise in frustration.
Siloing - teams, departments and offices are very isolated from each other.

2018-01-29, Solutions Architect,Madrid,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",Global Solution Architect,"Still an innovative company in a very few areas, particularly for 5G and if you're based in Sweden.
","Some great minds, but loads of under performing, arrogant colleagues. The company hired a lot of people with the aim of becoming relevant in the BSS/OSS transformation business and the rapid growth meant not only bad hires but also lack of real delivery methodology and a false sense of success for the original staff.
The internal politics is absolutely insane, leading to several ethical issues.
Advice to Management
The massive layoffs are letting a lot of good people go, while most of the rats are staying - and getting promoted. You need proper ways of evaluating who stays and who goes. The people staying are not the best ones to get the company out of this huge crisis.

Business Outlook
Pros
Low to no pressure. Excellent customer base. Truly global organisation. Some excellent people work here who know everything there is to know about their particular field/product.
Cons
Hugely political, almost comedically so. Far, far too many managers. huge amounts of overlap between roles and departments which leads to no responsibility and zero accountability. Weak culture with strategy taken as 'guidance' rather than gospel. Leadership seems incredibly arrogant, possibly due to the fat that most people have been here well over 10 years. Needs to shift FAST to an XaaS model, but no real signs of that happening.
Advice to Management
Make your strategy compulsory. Slimline your sales operations - 4 people doing the same thing is simply poor. Learn from your competitors/partners - their experience could teach you a LOT. And reinstate the share scheme - how can employees really be vested in the companies future if we can't share in it financially?

Pros
Benefits and salary are good. Some good people too.
Cons
Management is pretty clueless and they don't have the guts or power to fix the situation we are in right now. Despite having a lot of work right now, we can't hire additional staff. In fact, quite the opposite is happening. We are working long hours and losing people (because maybe the grass is greener on the other side of the fence, or because management refuses to keep good people). Fear of layoffs is pretty high.
Advice to Management
We have a lot of good people. Instead of just laying them off left and right, maybe look at areas of the business that are doing well (I know there isn't a lot in that category) and, instead of shoving people out the door, offer them the opportunity to move into an area they may be able to help in and perhaps even enjoy.

","E/// was (is?) incapable of adopting a software-development mindset. They are very hidebound, with many layers of bureaucracy in which helping one another to achieve larger goals isn't emphasized.

Advice to Management

If E/// wants to play in the software space that needs to be fixed, to connect the top with the implementors and empower teams to make Ericsson successful again.

","Questionable choices in acquisitions are haunting the company and management is still trying to recover. Necessary layoffs went way to far (by 50%). Well placed Managers of poor performing or dismantled groups reassigned and promoted to business areas they didn't understand or manage well. Managers are ineffective and fearful of current group head. Revolving door management, good ones leave or fired, bad one stay. Products they believe are the future are dragging the company down while the core money makers are left to languish without proper support. Over-complicated business and customer management systems.
Advice to Management
Not being a CEO or trained for that level of management it would be difficult to make a recommendation. I can say that the Former CEO really knew how to rally investors and customers, this one not so much. The CEO needs of this company require a strong balance sales and tech to promote the company and its products. 
Was the former CEO perfect...no but he was a man of the people and knew how to sell. As a numbers man you know the bottom line and that is important however more often than not the bottom line is easier to manage when you are actually selling products. 
Another example of how Management can take a great company with a positive future to something not that great.

Repor","Not being a CEO or trained for that level of management it would be difficult to make a recommendation. I can say that the Former CEO really knew how to rally investors and customers, this one not so much.

They treat their resources as something they can just use and dump. 
Once your project gets over, their is high probability that you'll be out of office maybe very next day, despite being fresher or whatsoever. They don't consider what are you going to do with 6 months or 1 year of Experience. 
Although they pay you for 3 months, but it's like treating somebody like a cattle and finally giving them few bucks in the name of Ericsson goodwill. 
They blindly just lay off employees, even if they're hired just couple of months back as freshers, who rejected the offers of IT giant like infy/cogni to join this ""not so promising"" organization EGIL. 
If you're a fresher, I highly recommend you to opt for anything but EGIL.

","Leadership is running on panic fumes. Strategy is unrealistic and we would keep getting ceo messages that we have to sell and push, while we were not given any guarantee of our jobs or a solid reason why we should still believe in Ericsson. Moreover, due to financial constraints they're firing people and dumping all remaining work onto exisiting staff with no compensation other than be happy you have a job attitude, so there is a lot of burn out and senior leadership does not give a damn about employee well being. Also they keep the consultants and contingency workers, while they lay off perm employees. Anyone who does not have a Swede backing them or pushing for them will lose ground fast.
Advice to Management
Cut consultants, keep perm employees and retrain where necessary and don't do that only in SWEDEN/HQ. Even if you lay off 25K perm employees by Dec 31th you still won't make the numbers enough to impress stock holders or the market, as the sales are still flat. So, best focus on the perm employees, give them a reason to want to stay. otherwise even those who stay will not be loyal or care about this organization. Worse yet, they'll go work for your competitors and they'll make it their mission to ensure that your competitors succeed and pass you more than they already have.

2017-11-18,Anonymous,,Current Employee,review,"W/L balance - but still lot depends on manager. If manager is good, nothing is a problem, but salary hike will be a problem anyways for some people.
","1. Everyone talks of innovation but actually there is no innovation seen. Big ideas are not entertained. GETs are expected to learn everything on their own and become experts by reading complex documentation.
2. HR is such a show-off. There are no learning taken from exit interviews.
 They are least concerned about your career growth. 
3. For promotion, you need to clear unimaginable certifications just to qualify for promotions. After that, if your manager wants , he will promote you, otherwise not.
4. Employees are forced to take Ericsson Technical Certification - which has no market value. It's usual for people to take shortcut to clear such exams when it is forced upon them. Then you play good cop by saying we have tightened certification policies.
Advice to Management
1. Groom GETs. They need direction. They join Ericsson as a dream company but leave because of poor direction. Then you say Ericsson needs fresh talent.
2. Recognize hard/smart workers. The one who works till 1AM doesn't get any substantial benefit that someone who doesn't work much even in office hours.
3. Give reasons to employees to clear tech. certifications. Not one person is happy to study for these certifications.

Business Outlook
Pros
* Great opportunity to meet with customers and service providers around the world
* It's Ericsson, a trusted partner for service providers
* Flexible Working environment, not a problem being a remote employee
* Great benefit package
Cons
* The restructuring is not going well, they are cutting key areas within the company
* They are pulling back from manufacturing
* Extreme pressure by the stockholders to turn the corner and become profitable again
* More deep employee reductions looming in the future
Advice to Management
Reach out to your employees. In times of restructuring, the employees are your most valuable assets and during times of uncertainty, those that can find other jobs, will so talk to them and be honest with them about their future and where they fit into the big picture.

2017-11-08, Implementation Manager,,"Former Employee, less than 1 year",One of the best places to work if you can manage to stay in it,"Very well structured and organized.
Ericsson is very professional when it comes to delivering fast track projects
They can simply do what others cannot
Very huge number of employees(almost 120,000), which gives you a great chance to meet and get introduced to different people from different cultures/countries.
","Many employees/managers are giving a bad image about it with their bad behavior.
Some nationalities make lobbies in some country offices, which makes it very hard for you to work with them as they prefer to get their own people.
Ericsson does layoffs every now and then, and that's a very serious issue when it comes to career stability.
Ericsson changes its organizational structure very frequently, and that's really bad as every year you end up with a new manager who knows nothing about you, and hence you have to start to prove yourself again and again.
Advice to Management
I hope that you could really make it with the new organization and new changes, coz Ericsson is a treasure to the telecom industry and it has to stay in the market. 
I am proud that I worked in Ericsson for 13 years, and I hope to work in it again 1 day.
Good luck and God be with you

Salary is good

Ehealth program is supported by many employees
Open concept office space and hydraulic standing desks for all
Some flexibility and work from home, depending on which team you are on Developers work all hours and are typically on site from 10am to 4pm
Free coffee and tea
","I was recruited and misled about a number of things. The recruiter told me benefits were free and refused to provide details of coverage. Found out during onboarding that was not the case. The role described during the interview to lure me away from my fulltime job was not the role I ended up doing. No explanation was ever provided. Paid meal breaks were not provided for an 8 hr work day. Product training was non-existent, my questions were never addressed. There seemed to be a general lack of knowledge on the manager's part. I was isolated from project and product management, making my tasks difficult.
Culture seems odd, people reported having personal items disappear from their desks, this was ignored by management. Management has a habit of gossiping about employees in a negative manner.
Too many other problems to list here, if you accept a role ensure the offer is reviewed by a lawyer as many clauses violate the ESA in Ontario. Was warned by my lawyer to turn the offer down but I had high hopes for a once greatly admired brand.

A revolving door of employees for a certain role indicates the problem is with the manager. If the entire team gives a manager poor reviews....why not listen?

The new CEO seems full of good ideas to turn things around with innovative ideas but will struggle if he keeps the current dead weight in management.
","Opportunities to further your career by promotions or moving into other fields (ie engineering into project management) are difficult to do and often takes years to occur. 
Pay rises are terrible, often less than 1.5% per annum. 
The hard to come by promotions means that often staff are far more experienced and contribute much more to projects than they should be for their level and pay-grade, resulting in an unconscionable win for a stingy business.
Too much management, I worked there 10yrs+ and all I saw management do was regurgitate what higher management told them and rarely add value to the business.

Cut management to the bone, promote and adequately pay staff commensurate with skills and experience.

","No career path for software engineers. The idea of being a generalist (knowing a bit of everything) is promoted but weirdly it is rewarding to be a specialist in one field.

Pros
It is a job that pays money. You can try to do different things in different roles and you can learn new things. People are polite and nice. Coworkers are excellent professionals.
Cons
- it used to have good work-life balance.
- health plan is good on paper not in practice.
- competition with Huawei paradoxically seems to drive permanent engineer's salaries down (?)
- developers need to hone their skills but there is no training in place and no projects.
- salary is not competitive and they won't try to match it, as you grow older you might be left out so watch out.
- meetings.
- food is not good.
- too much focus on ""gender"", that has alienated merit-driven people (women too).
- high pressure in projects with poor prospects.
- employees are generally demoralized and looking for alternatives.
- no career path on R&D, hard to switch within as there is no room upwards.
- few very good developers left, now the learning curve for the rest of us is much steeper.
Advice to Management
Developers have no career path and no salary increase unless they go to management.

","The company has failed to secure new contracts, so the culture is you never know from one day to the next if you will have a job! Management is very uncaring of their employees and will layoff fulltime employees to hire contractors to come in and take their jobs to save money. Ericsson also has a policy of 80/20 which means 80% of the work has to be done offshore and they move to push everything the can to India so this displaces American workers. They require employees to log hours they do not work and if you do not do this you are placed on a list to be laid off.
Advice to Management
Stop being so secretive and be honest to employees. When you tell the employees they are not going to be any workforce reductions you should keep to your word instead of trying to be secretive and letting people go a few at a time to hide what you are doing.

- Old guard will make your life very difficult
- They hire senior people and would not know what to do with them after that. 
- Playing with careers of leaders hired from market
- You need to be master of Playing politics to survive in this company

2017-07-28, Software Developer,"São Paulo, São Paulo, São Paulo","Current Employee, more than 3 years",Could be awesome,"+ There are very good professionals to work with and learn from

+ People are very respectful

+ Opportunity to code in C++, which is rarely seen today in Brazil

+ Extra hours and ""on-call"" are correctly paid, which means you can increase your income substantially when you work more
","+ Management in general have little knowledge of software development business

+ Lack of knowledge of software makes managers approach innovation and career development of subordinates in a KPI-driven manner, without actually being capable of understanding what is really going on with people and projects

+ Very competent people might never have a real raise in their salaries because managers are not capable of recognizing their contributions, probably because they are blind to see anything which is not in their metrics (a consequence of not knowing the software business)

+ Products use out-dated technologies and there is no culture to foster innovation on this aspect

+ In general, technical staff sees career development programs as boring, because they no longer rely on line managers and do not believe there will a reward for those who work hard on what matters

+ You can see incompetent people climbing in their careers by means of good relationships and tricking performance numbers, and when become managers appear to have no real interest for productive stuff (like raising competence of technical staff, recognizing talents or ease the life of workers doing a good job), but only projects that can render some good visibility

+ There is a trend in technical staff for migrating to tasks that are less and less related to software development, as if they are abandoning the interest for the real business (because it is not as rewarding as doing spreadsheets)

+ It is frequent to hear a discourse about the importance of quality, and you see a lot of measuring of quality metrics, but little action or smart conclusions

+ Most of the technical staff is now outsourced and composed of more junior professionals, which are visibly less competent on average, something that obviously impacts quality of deliverables, but there is not much evidence that management realizes that or even cares about it

+ Not only managers, but in general, people are missing the bigger picture, and forgot that quality is not going to improve by only measuring it, because that requires action and investment
Advice to Management
I cannot see how the software design unit in Brazil is ever going to thrive having a management that has no real interest on software. I have a feeling that most people on the area (specially on management) are there only to cash good money while Ericsson does not sink.
It is a shame, because otherwise it would e a top notch place to work.
Leaving the negative points beside, this company as a beautiful culture and might be one of the last employers that actually seem to care about something else but making money to share-holders.
There is the inevitable presence of people that are going to take advantage of this just to slack until retirement.
However, you can also see professionals that really love what they do and are in a mission to serve society with the best of their skills. These employees should be better taken care of.

Flat hierarchical structure, where people can reach out anyone at anytime. 
Few projects use cutting edge technologies providing more career development and growth.
Excellent recognition and rewards to the people who perform well in the projects.
Excellent people to interact with, thus creating a spirit to work for the company.
","Salary hike is not consistent across the years leading to demotivate the employees. The new hires are paid way too high when compared to the ones already working out their soul for Ericsson.
Work load is not shared equally between the team members.
Advice to Management
Management is doing their best at Ericsson, listening to each one's queries, but they can be little more transparent.
Hiring needs to be more strict as many new hires are lacking much technical knowledge and confidence. They are paid so high and I feel they are not upto the mark.
Interview process needs to be formulated and made strict. An interview panel across a Region can be a way forward. The Interview Panel needs to be paid for their extra efforts in getting the right candidate and training had to be given to those who actually take interviews. A tough and a rigid interview must happen to filter the right candidates.

2017-07-09, Software Engineer,"Plano, TX","Current Employee, more than 5 years","Cutting edge software development if you want it. Cloud, Docker, Gradle, Groovy, you name it.","Benefits, Family oriented, work from home options.

If you need help or training, just ask because it is not seen as a weakness but as a way to grow the talent and the teams. Other organizations I have worked for have always considered this a weakness, but not Ericsson. We all learn together and sharing through brown bags and learning lunches is encouraged.
","Software engineers are often shuffling between 2 projects, sometimes 3 because of the high rate of our customers wants and needs. The benefit however here, is that you are constantly growing and learning !

Training is provided but you really have to push and ask for it if there is a need (not really a con, its expected you should ask if you need help)

In North America and Canada, there is a bit too many non technical managers I would say, but this stems from the fact previously about many projects, sometimes simultaneously that your working on as a software engineer, so you sometimes get the feeling you have 2 or 3 managers, but in reality there's always only 1 direct report relationship that you have in your career.

","HR in India is not as active as required. Everything depends on your manager. If your manager is good then you can continue for long time. If you face any problem with your manager, then your life will be difficult. The departments work as independent pockets and may or may not follow the overall good culture of the organization.

- modern offices
- flexible work hours
- working from home
- good, relaxed atmosphere, surrounded with fun people from different backgrounds and countries, very international
- paid overtime
","For a communications company the internal communications are beyond bad, finding any information in a jungle of acronyms that nobody knows what they stand for is rather untransparent and difficult.

- shockingly low salaries/no salary increases/no bonuses (in the UK at least)
- high staff turnover
- a lot of offshoring and redundancies
- HR is slow and unorganised, hard to find information

","Very unfair advancement opportunities. If you do not have or have not established a personal relationship with a member of management or executive team, do not expect to be advanced. These opportunities are only granted to friends and family while management forces its employees to believe it is their sole responsibility to map out their career.

Use credential: Educations, experience and knowledge for considerations of advancement opportunities versus relationships.

Flexible working hours (at least in my area)
","Large amount of work has been shifted to India. They have no clue how things in the UK work and seem unwilling to learn. They made lots of staff in the UK redundant to move to a cheaper and entirely less competent workforce

Awful IT systems that are managed by the same group in India (expect lots of ""Please do the needful"" Indian-isms). They love acronyms and hashtags!

Management are clueless, there's a fear/blame culture seemingly stemming from upper management. 

While hours are flexible, you will be expected to do a lot of admin work in your own time

Lots of red-tape, lots of project managers, lots of pointless meetings

Benefits package is useless. Share scheme has been stopped, perks-at-work is normally more expense than I can get as a normal consumer. Pension isn't great.

No promotions, no incentive to work hard. Bonus scheme paid a whole 1% last year

Pay rises have been awful (or non-existent) for years, yet the CEO and upper management take home a kings bounty

2017-05-10, Picture Researcher,"Ealing, England, England","Current Employee, more than 5 years",Still ambivalent after 5 years,"The company I worked for before was bought by Ericsson, and everything started out well with a forward-looking management team and the will to invest in new technologies. Since then, however, we have been hit by redundancies and increasing bureaucracy. Modern offices, nice location, great colleagues who are generally intelligent, lively and very overqualified for the job. Some of the content is really interesting as work is for a variety of broadcasters/clients. Laid-back culture for the most part. Decent benefits such as flexible working and the possibility of working from home.
","Pay is shockingly low among non-managers and even middle managers, though the company likes to tell us it is in line with industry standards. Management training is almost non-existent, and there seem to be far too many people employed at higher levels with incomprehensible job titles and functions. Managers are also sometimes expected to be account managers rather than people managers, meaning that staff can be overlooked. Staff turnover on some teams is so bad it is like a revolving door, and work/life balance varies greatly depending on which team you are on. Some jobs are extremely monotonous. Many people come to rely on overtime money because the base salaries are so bad. The IT systems are impenetrable, and dealing with other teams that are all in other countries because of offshoring (e.g. for expenses or HR, for example) can be difficult and bureaucratic. Team spirit has decreased since we were bought, and retention is increasingly difficult. Opportunities for advancement do exist, but generally not within teams - you would have to change job role internally.

Ericsson North America. Good work rewarded when possible. Training online for multiple positions and functions via employee produced and external training companies. Many responsible full time employees.
","Management employees are over worked which leaves less time to find contracts for the company. Recent management seems to be using only contract workers.
Advice to Management
Temporary work force is not the way to a great team. Keep up the great Employee compensation/benefits. Strive to find more long term contracts to keep your worker bees busy and expanding. Find more contracts that stage for the next contract. Give your middle management some relief if possible.

","Ericsson's RNAM (Region North America) lost a large portion of its contract with its biggest customer Sprint. More layoffs imminent as they cannot sustain their employees without sizable new business. Employees once occupied two buildings at the Sprint Headquarters campus with a total of 5-6 floors. Within less than 8 years they are now down to all employees in one building occupying less than two floors! Sad.

It has a presence in many countries and understands the need for diversity. Ericsson is a market leader, in fact likely the market leader, in telecoms equipment.
","It also has problems that large companies tend to have. It will take you many years to advance, no matter how ambitious you are. It is led by large shareholders who have a very narrow idea of what modern business practices are, and a board that is mostly unable to understand disruptions like the internet, so it has a big problem innovating. Since it is the market leader it has a lot of competitive advantages, but those are mostly used to create a barrier to entry instead of innovating.
Advice to Management
The corporate culture has a bit of a Swedish bent, which isn't necessarily bad, but it is really conservative. If you're looking for fiercely competitive business practices with an impatient, and highly talented culture, you may want to look somewhere else. If you're looking for a solid performer, that dominates its market, has collegial atmostphere and room to grow, then you could do a whole lot worse than Ericsson.

2017-04-12, Project Manager,Bucharest,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",OK-ish,"Big-name company, chance to advance a lot, to higher positions due to many people leaving the company, thus creating a lot of space.
","Also the con, many people leaving can't be a good thing. Decisions are many times slow to obtain. probably the slowest moving company you can imagine. Some mid-to-higher management people don't have basic knowledge of project management, they are indeed experts, but their current roles are not suitable for their experience.
Advice to Management
Explain the strategy more, translate it to concrete things, get rid of the corporate language. Follow the style of the new appointed CEO which I think is really effective. He is the first top-management person, IN A LONG TIME, to name things as they are and not beat around the bush.

","No learning or development, no budget for professional qualifications, no in-house training.
Very poor middle to senior management within the subtitling arm - people who had been bought in when the BBC sold off their department were lacking in soft skills and motivation.
Ericsson HR is outsourced - this led to the incorrect salary being quoted to my bank when applying for a mortgage. Ericsson were unable to provide my current employer with proof that I had worked there. I was placed on the wrong tax code since leaving due to Ericsson HR ineptitude, and have been overpaying tax for much of the past financial year. 

Horrendous company, I had not quite realised how poor the training, opportunities, facilities and services were until I had left and started in a company with none of these issues.
Advice to Management
Implement 360 reviews again, but without the option for the individual to self-select who supplies their reviews. This will show the senior management (client relationship manager type level) who have none of the skills required for their roles. Review pay, it is below market average and not competitive. Review pay of legacy BBC contract employees - disproportionately high.

Keep up good work. Please try to get more long term projects so that employees will get more confidence to stay here for long. Billing emails should not be send at the last moment if so, mistakes can be avoided.

Working at this company has caused me my mental health and wellbeing, and this is not the first time something similar has happened.

Just to clarify, the local branch has still not apologized or acknowledged their mistakes, and some were a clear violation of local labour laws.

Business Outlook
Pros
Best thing about this company... BENEFITS! Their benefit package was amazing! Pay was pretty good, too, on top of that.
Cons
For the last few years there have been one or two layoffs each year, which made going to work extra stressful. There also seemed to be a lot of groups and people that didn't want to work together for fear of sharing something that would make them irrelevant, so communication started to get pretty poor. Ultimately, all of this was due to shifting contracts and inability to get new contracts. Lack of work for the company meant less need for employees.
Advice to Management
Know the jobs better of the people working below you and be willing to listen to them. Sometimes knowing the work being done and listening to the people doing it can help solve some problems in different ways than are discussed in board rooms.

Pros
The best reason to work at Ericsson is because it's a job.
Cons
Could care less about their top employees. They don't even pay their expenses in a timely manner. After months of claiming that they are still fixing an accounting system they still haven't paid what amounts to double digits. Their credit card never even begins to cover monthly costs of travelling around the globe. Additionally when they have paid it is always late and it is up to the employee to pay late fees.
Advice to Management
Pay attention to your employees. You have some great ones, but no one seems to care.Everyone runs around like a chicken with its head cut off and there is no direction. There is no one to even complain too. And don't ever pay your own expenses. It will be months before you see them.

Its working environment was one of the most innovative and trustworthy I had been experiencing (before that I've been with a dozen other MNC). The processes were strong. The Management was transparent and close to front line. The team was friendly and supportive and customer oriented.
","Under Hans Vestberg, the Company has been getting less and less innovative and more and more political at all levels (less doers, more players/talkers). The Management was less transparent and more deceiving in their management style. Hence the constant downward annual result trend throughout Hans' CEO years.

2017-01-29, Assistant Engineer,Noida,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",Ericsson India: A good company to start with as an ECE graduate,"There is a lot of scope for training and knowlege accumulation in various verticals of Telecom Industry.Noida location has greater proportion of employees working in Sprint and Bharti projects.There are always periodic renewal of projects coupled with Ericsson's HR policies keeping employees satisfied with Job safety.Night Shifts depend on Client project.
","leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to job satisfaction.Salary is waivering around the market average leading to a lot of employees moving on to better paying Jobs.Stagnation is inevitable.Just like any other MNC run on Indian soil,office politics is also a deciding factor in growth and future.
Advice to Management
Try being a bit more flexible and more attentive when it comes to picking resources for a project and training.Would urge senior management to push for a deeper understanding of their diverse employee base and reconsider the decision to scrap beneficial amenities like compensation for a personal cellphone.

Advice to Management
After major re-org, allow some time for organisational adjustment. Basically, don't do major re-org every year. At Business Unit and Regional level, we have seen major re-orgs in past couple of years, and people have hard time following who is who any more. 
Celebrate teams success and share company's (local and global strategy) at half yearly, or quarterly all employee meetings. Praise go's a long way. First we had 2 per year, then 1 per year, and I don't even rememver when was the last one at GSC in Bucharest. 
Improve work benefit: ""If you pay peanuts, you get monkeys"". It's not all about pay. Flexible working hours count a lot, especially in big and busy city like Bucharest. 
Ensure E/// attracts top talent, not only for TOP250 management positions, but also to for the key technical roles. Don't be training ground for other competitor companies (basically people leave for ""greener fields"" after they acquire some knowledge). 
It's all about communication and innovation, right? So work on team building and company comradery. Ensure budget for at least once a year social/sports event, dinner/night out, or similar. People basically don't know each other past several desks away or other team members. It;s hard to share experiences and knowledge. 
Eliminate silo mentality and enable ""one Ericsson"" culture.

2017-01-22, Project Manager,"Overland Park, KS","Former Employee, more than 8 years",Ignorance and Misogyny Abound,"Great benefits and some amazing people. Working on a campus provides nice amenities.
","Management and executive leadership do not reflect the diversity of the people they're leading; if you aren't in with the right people, you have no hope of moving forward. Misogyny and racism, while hopefully accidental, are not addressed appropriately. The appearance of inappropriate relationships between leadership and staff occurs often and is not addressed. There is lip service paid to diversity and inclusion in North America, but there seems to be a disconnect from HQ in Plano to the Overland Park office. Managers make jokes about people they've laid off, and disparage employees in front of other employees. 

I have noticed, reading through these reviews, that Ericsson responds nicely to the positive reviews. A response to a negative review, any of the reviews that have brought up negative experiences, would show potential and current employees that Ericsson does care about their employees and wants to ensure a safe, healthy, productive, and positive environment for them all.
Advice to Management
Management should be held as examples to their employees.

2017-01-17, Software Engineer,"Canton, MI","Current Employee, more than 10 years",A shell of what it once was,"Decent 401k.
Good medical benefits.
Flexible working hours, no time clock.
","The past years have not been kind to Ericsson.

1. Little to no promotion opportunities.
The company prefers hiring externally for any senior position. This is a terrible policy as it allows for little to no upward mobility for existing employees. 

2. Awful, terrible management.
See item 1. The senior and management resources brought in, have little to no understanding of the company and its ways of working. They are often colleagues and friends of other senior resources... I can name you half a dozen Alcatel-Lucent folks all brought in. This nepotism is destroying the company. They have no vision, no drive, and no interest in improving anything or doing any actual work.

3. Benefits are lacking.
The stock purchase plan was canceled in Jan 2017. That's a 7.5% pay cut. It's not canceled for senior management of course, even though they ran the company into the ground.

4. Constant layoffs.
This has been ongoing for 2 years now and there it no end in sight. Every few months your team loses 2-4 people. Sounds like a place you want to work?

5. Too much overhead and management layers.
See also item 1. Despite promises to do something about this for 12+ months, there is no change. When layoffs come, regular emplyees are let go. It's never the layer upon layer of directors and VPs that are axed. We have VPs reporting to VPs reporting to VPs.... I'm not kidding. With little to no direct reports. How is that even possible? But hey, that's what you get with terrible management.

6. Terrible processes.
Need to order something? Need to bring an overseas resource in? Need to find a pen? Need to fix a problem with a tool or time entry? Good luck. I hope you have 2 hours each day for the coming 5 days to beg, borrow, and steal to get the help you need.

7. Pay for anyone not ""grandfatherered"" into a big salary or hired from the outside
Some folks make enormous sums of money. Mainly the countless directors and VPs that are breaking the back of the company (see up)... 300K a year type of money. The rank and file employees, some make great money if they've been here through the boom days of the late 1990s. Other, younger employees who were hired as a regular employee and not a ""super important"" manager (see item 2 above) are stuck making 70K a year with an annual raise of 1-2%. Good luck ever catching up.

8. No strategy or vision.
We are wildly flailing our arms trying to catch buzzwords. One day we have to do ""cloud."" The next it is declared we're going to be ""Agile."" Then next week it's ""devops"" and ""the internet of things."" Meanwhile, in reality, we've had our own cloud product ECE (Ericsson Cloud Environment) that's been in development for 3+ years and has yet to work or even be sold. Agile exists only in the minds of our clueless managers. Our product catalog contains hundreds if not thousands of products that are obsolete and don't sell. Management makes their fat paychecks and figures they can hang around another 2-3 years doing nothing, and they simply don't care.

Good compensation and bonus (mine was 1/2 yearly base salary in 2016)
Flexible working hours and home office
","No management culture : middle managers are mainly dedicated to administrative tasks and do not move upwards nor motivate their subordinates.
Very administrative matrix structure : much time is lost in coordination/escalation instead of delivering value to the customer
Matrix cross-country organization is very badly handled : no team meetings, no horizontal, ascending and descending communication inside the teams.
In Latin America : there is no meritocracy; good networking and politics count much more than good results to grow there (and to stay there!)

Good long term vision, work/life balance quite OK, outstanding and brilliant colleagues. Management style of most managers is quite relaxed.
Cons
Too much internal politics -- whole departments suffer because someone somewhere executed a power play to keep their VP title and ownership of a once successful product. Too much bureaucracy and unnecessary process. Poor execution of client projects: they take too long, are too expensive, and in the end suffer from poor quality due to rushing to meet overdue deadlines. It seems like the preferred solution to many problems is ""throw more people at it"".

","Consistent yearly suprise lay offs, sometimes twice a year. This company focuses too much on profits and had no problem getting rid of the people with the most experience. Unless you have a special skill, it is also hard to move around.

2017-01-01, Managed Services,"Orlando, FL","Former Employee, more than 5 years",Great Teamwork Poor Uppler/ Exec Management,"Money and Benefits are great - Team atmosphere in business units is high. The company is so disorganized that if you like a challenge, you are often able to take on projects and tasks that are out of your original/main scope and migrate throughout different business unites based upon the successes that you may not have been able to attain if left only to a tightly managed single tract.
","Flapping around like a fish out of water trying to plan for the future instead of driving the market towards that future.
Advice to Management
Please groom successful leaders in engineering and operations to migrate into upper management . The board members are clueless as to where the companies money is spent and wasted. How can you drive efficiency if you have never worked in the business?
