2019-11-14, Project Engineer,Riyadh,"Former Employee, more than 5 years",good company overall with a screwed up work life balance,"1. LG Culture - if you work there long enough you adopt a culture that is hard to let go of, I am sure this is the case with several MNCs. 2. Korean way of working - From what I have experienced, there would be very little or no politics among the colleagues as all your managers are going to be Koreans, and they don't trust any of their sub-ordinates. 3. Getting to know what's happening with other departments - At each subsidiary's HQ, you often meet and make friends from different department members and get exposed to their business models and practices. I think this is probably due to the way office is laid out, unlike in other companies where different departments are separated from each other.
","1. Forgot work-life balance - even if you are back home on time, they will somehow make sure your mind is at work almost all the time as its impossible to satisfy your manager or the company's demand 2. You could only grow so much - irrespective of how long you stay in the company, you can never truly become a manager, as there will be a Korean PM above you, commanding you what to do and what not to do.

","I was with the company for 10 years in the A/R Dept. There are so many Cons about this dept that I don’t even know where to start…. I think the only reason why I stayed that long was because of the benefits, which were excellent, no employee contributions (nothing comes out of your paycheck). And also my American colleagues which we made it fun and supported each other in that crazy dept. Most are Koreans and they ALWAYS speak Korean all day long. Even in meetings they would sometimes excuse themselves and just talk Korean. The head of the dept is also Korean and she is very strict and micro manages everything. She expects everyone to be at there desk at exactly 8am every morning, and she would sometimes walk down the isle of each cubicle to see who was late…..We were treated like in grade school and we had to let one of our colleagues know whenever we would get up to go to the restroom. You’re called into the VP’s office (like a child in grade school walking into the principals office) especially during month end closing to micro manage your work and pretty much question and reprimand you. Senior management was always frustrated, overwhelmed and stressed out in which that energy was passed on to us. There was very little to no work/life balance. Low employee morale, and overall a negative environment, most of us were always miserable to be there. There is no room to grow or move up in the dept. And even if you had a chance to move up you wouldn’t even want the position because that meant you had to work more directly with the dept VP and no one wanted that anyway. And your vacation was to be pre-approved by senior management and dept VP during month end closing or year -end closing. You are also expected to work over time during month end and year -end closing.
