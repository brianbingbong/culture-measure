","1. If you are not Chinese, you will feel excluded. The majority of employees are Chinese, formal communication is in Chinese. I felt like a second class employee during my tenure. 2. My manager did not know how to use a software versioning system. Development with them was a nightmare. Code was being shared through zip files. 3. Most people in management know very little about the mathematics of machine learning. If you communicate what they are saying does not make sense, they will tell you to implement it anyway. When it doesn't work you will get the blame because you did not ""debug"" it properly. 4. Management tracks your hours not your productivity. 5. Management will shame you in front of other employees instead of giving you feedback in private. There have been instances where my manager rolled their eyes as I was explaining what I was doing. There were times when I was told that management was talking behind my back. 6. You will not receive a GPU enabled device for the first three months of your tenure. There is a very limited GPU server and you will not be able to run your job there. 7. If you talk to the director or human resources, they are not there mediate. 8. As a researcher you have no opportunity to do a literature review and come up with proposal. There is a proposal process, but at the end of the day you end up doing what your manager wants you to do. 9. The research group as a whole is disoriented. It is not known if the goal is to publish or a product. 10. You will have less access to data because of US sanctions. You are better off working in any other company when it comes to data.

In some periods, work load is very high (some annual targets) for 1-2-3 months continuously, daily; you feel like you want to quit the job (sometimes no time for lunch) and no extra resources arrangements are made by the management. Salary increase is according to yearly evaluation, company results; mostly the salary you start will be the salary you will keep. You work only with one vendor (general for all vendor companies) so if you want to change company you need to learn the equipment/technology of the other vendor; so no much flexibility in job changing.

In my career of working with 5 MNCs, this company gives you real 360 Deg feedback option to rate your appraiser. Its a common scenario where an engineer with perseverence and good ideas grow to become a program manager or business head in a span of 3 to 4 years. The result being some employees becoming managers of people who were their managers at the beginning. It happens regularly here, where results of indivual is appreciated and rewarded at top of the market compensation. Also i have never seen an employee getting fired on basis of performance without giving him/her considerable amount of changes in different areas to prove themselves. Even then, those cases will be audited and reviewed if its an objective decision by the ethics comittee. Most of all , they respect experienced members no matter the age and dont judget them on basis of 1 or 2 poor year(s). People with experience adapability to environments similar to start-ups and skills to match the role they are in , grow faster here. Politics is least found here, and mostly conducted by very few personalities as its widely condemed here.

","Where do I begin? When I first told people I was going to work for a Chinese tech company, many in my circle advised me against it. At first, I felt it was not fair and maybe a little racist. But after 3.5 years there, now I know better: its not about what they look like or what language they speak or what food they eat. Its about what they do. This company is devoted to cheating, lying and deceiving people in the quest to acquire technology. Just 2 years ago or so, there was a lawsuit against Huawei by a former employee in Canada who said in a news article that Huawei was a vast intelligence operation. Based on what I saw and experiened, I feel this is true. Huawei has almost 30 ""research"" centers all over the world where their ""research"" just involves sourcing technology by any means possible. In the project I was in, they shipped a certain component that was export controlled and not meant for exporting to China by declaring an exemption themselves! They did it 3 times! I was twice asked to do something questionable and probably illegal but I declined. The company has rules on paper against such activities but well its just paper. I have never seen a culture so corrupt and full of deceit. What makes it worse is that, they abuse the hospitality of their host countries and slowly turn some of their non-Chinese employees to do things their way because employees are rewarded for their ""contributions"". I was not involved in 5G and I don't know anything about the CEO's daughter but I don't trust this company and would be the least surprised if accusations against her come out to be true, based on what I saw and experienced. Another interesting fact: I have been monitoring Glassdoor reviews for this company from years ago and I know for a fact that there were many negative reviews here and new reviews were not incoming - the reviews were stagnant for quite some time but then all of a sudden, I see some positive 1 liner reviews. These are all fake, trust me. What some of the older reviews say: ""Huawei is only interested in your former employer's IP"" etc are all so true. This company exists to cheat and its employees behave as if its their daily job - find a new way of acquiring technology and when they do, they rub their hands in glee thinking how smart they are. This is not a company where an engineer can make a career. The CEO Reng Zhengfei is the biggest cheerleader I know. He gives the most amazing, good-to-hear speeches but all are fake. Once he said in a BBC news article that Huawei doesnt need to spy since it has 90,000 engineers but he omitted the fact that these are not 90,0000 engineers but 90,000 incompetent imbeciles who rely on research centres abroad to feed them with technology acquired via questionable means. There is not a single new Chinese tech that is totally indigenous. I also met at least 2 employees in Huawei China that were ex-military so I am also inclined to believe what the US is saying. The non-local employees and managers from HQ try to act friendly with local staff but well role play is role play. There are many telltale signs giving them away when they try to convince you to ""collaborate"" with your former or other companies. At the end of day, we must keep in mind that this is not a British or German or Japanese or American company that has some decency. In all, I decided that my years there were not a total waste since I got to know what a scum company looks and operates like. I will take it as a good lesson learned. In summary, Huawei's research centers are not for research. They are just there to poach employees from rival companies.

I am currently based in the company’s head offices in the UK, in Reading. I assumed several responsibilities from day one while at the same time I embarked on a well-planned induction and training programme that involved training in Reading, Birmingham, Dusseldorf, Milan. Unfortunately missed out on Madrid due to the onset of Covid-19. I had close mentoring, guidance, and feedback throughout my employment which I found very practical and constructive and at the same time, as a programmer, I was encouraged and actually proposed ideas and improvements in areas where I had more advanced skills. Although the business environment is generally pleasant and flexible, the fast pace of the high tech industry requires lots of reserves of stamina, resolve, and determination. There is an opportunity to work and share experiences with other professionals in Reading and abroad. Good working conditions, sports teams that everyone is welcomed to join, quite decent restaurant especially if you are a fan of spicy Chinese cuisine, and organisation of various events. Chinese New Year’s party not to be missed.

","Treatment to whoever that is not Chinese is very bad. 1. They will hire you through a outsourcing company (manpower) for most Latin American countries, give you all the responsibilities of any position but the whole credit for any achievement will always be for your Chinese boss which will be able to move to a better position after one or two years. 2. No matter how many experience you have and how good you are doing your work, they will always make sure to send a Chinese guy from another office, city or even continent to be your supervisor. Even if you are lucky enough to be taken into account for a director position. 3. Serious meetings will always be a Chinese secret, usually done during the night (from 9:00pm and forward) to make sure that nobody from the local team can support or give any ideas. 4. Staying late and doing overtime (without getting paid) will be a plus during your stay in Huawei. It doesn't really matter if you stay late in the office playing candy crush or watching YouTube videos. You will only be a good asset to the company if you stay late, they say that it is a ""Cultural thing"". 5. Medical insurance, supermarket expenses, yearly bonus, share ownership will only be granted to you if you are a ""Chinese staff"". 6. Since your boss will be a Chinese guy, he won't have any idea about the working law for your country. 7. Feedback, couching, and career development does not exist. 8. One of the most common forms to get your Huawei ""staff"" promotion is getting very close to Chinese managers, this means, letting them know where the strip clubs are located in your country, going to casino with them (they love those ones), introduce them to some local girls, having good breasts, etc.

","* Lots of firing after US-China trade war. They are not even giving compensation to the employees who are getting fired. They forcefully ask the employees to resign by sending mail that ""Due to personal reasons I'm resigning."" * Too much work. You'll literally have no work life balance. I've never seen sunset after joining there. * Managers are the worst which you can find in the industry. They don't plan anything and all they know is to keep putting pressure on the developers to work work and work. * Though few teams work on some good technologies, many teams don't work on good technologies. Most of the good work will be taken by China and India will be doing all the crap work. * Indian managers are mainly puppets who'll listen to Chinese people and play the fool around. They accept whatever that comes from China. * Cafeteria is closed by 9.30 in the morning. So that employees don't ""waste"" their time having breakfast and they'll ""utilize"" in working and making it ""productive"". Same in the afternoon. * You'll have 1.5 Paid Leaves every month. But please keep in mind that you'll not need those since you'll not be granted leaves only. * As usual, lots of team politics (This is pretty common in many companies as I can't say as a con for Huawei alone) * If you complete your work in 12-13 hours and leave you'll not be respected, but even if you don't complete your work, but stay in office sitting here and there for 16+ hours, you'll have some respect (At least in the department which I've worked.

Working in Huawei seems to work in a startup of 180.000 employees; Within boundaries the proactive attitude is very appreciated. The company is owed by the employees that would get great benefit from the growth on the company itself A Giant but still with a humble attitude. Despite being number one or number 2 in most of the areas covered, the approach to the market is meek and open to learn and discuss. Never arrogant. Great respect to the competitors where the approach is never to attach and put down the competitors
","During the years I spent in Huawei I saw a big improvement in the culture gap but still there is a gap to cover. The management keep changing every 3-5 years and this makes difficult to truck the reason of specific decisions

What's worse is that every highly important e-mail is written in Chinese, even though 90% of the mail participants are English speakers.

","Where do I start? This is a totally Chinese company. as opposed to an international one. Here is what is wrong with it: 1. Boss is always right in the eastern culture and you notice that in all discussions and meetings. My boss's contribution to the discussions was minimal as he did not know anything about our project and he would not take the time to educate himself. 2. Non mandarin speaking people are second level employees. They are not consulted on anything . They have no idea about the discussions, project plans, etc. In our group, mandarin speaking employees would meet every day for hours and we had no idea what the discussion was about even though it would impact us directly. Most of the times, in the meetings, people start speaking mandarin for no reason without regard for the rest of the attendees. Very rude and disrespectful. They do not mingle with the rest of the employees and make you feel not welcome. 3. No transparency. In this culture, transparency is not valued and you are ALWAYS kept in the dark. 4. There are different standards for work place etiquette in Huawei. There are multiple signs about not spitting in the kitchen sink, not dirtying the washrooms, etc. 5. There is no diversity or respect for other cultures. It's all about the Chinese culture. In my estimate 70% + of the employees are Chinese. 6. CHAOS, CHAOS CHAOS: We did not have projects for more than a year. Everyday our boss would make up stories about the great projects we will be starting VERY soon. He would ask us to create powerpoints that no one would read and no one would give feedback because you are not part of the clique of mandarin speaking employees.. Be ready to waste your time for a year or two without having any actual work. Imagine what happens to your resume when you have nothing to show. 7. Promotions: Be ready to see a junior employee (education, work experience and history in the company) to become your boss very soon. Back to #1. Most managers are there because they speak mandarin. 8. This job located is in Markham. You have to drive everywhere and there is no diversity like the rest of the Toronto. I did not like Markham at all.

Most of the products knowledge you'll have to learn it by yourself. - If you are young is a good place to work but MOVE FAST to a next position.
","- Bad salaries if you are a freshman or almost non existent raises for long term employees. - Sales are blocked mainly because Huawei, not because competition or customers. Sometimes you have to explain two or three times the things to your chinese counterpart to convince him about almost anything (status of a project, opportunities, customer relationship) - The company internally is like two companies in one. One with the locals and the other with Chinese. Nowadays all crucial decisions are made exclusively by Chinese Managers; 100% those managers doesn't know a thing about the country they are, the language or the business culture and even worse most of them are just unexperienced even on management positions they are holding (I saw a new product manager for the whole carrier core network coming to the country with only programming experience and being younger and unexperienced than the whole engineer division under him). - The company is ruled by business culture that no one ... absolutely no one is unexpendable. They don't care to fired good employees or account managers with really good relationships with customers (and even lose those). - Be careful with the contracts, bonuses and extras they promise to you on your contract. I saw multiple times they reduced the final salary of managers or product specialist that came from the competition. Some colleagues got outsourcing contracts instead of direct contract without warning or even they got reduced salaries than what was offered in the selection process. Many of them just got bored and annoyed by the company in less than 9 months of being there. - Many bonuses are not as high as they promote to you or even some chinese employees got part in them without doing anything ... literally anything on the projects. A collegue got promised a raise, a big bonus and change of his contract after closing a big project (it got awarded) and he was fired. Be careful if you are looking for a commercial career here.

2019-03-14, Software Architect,"New York, NY","Current Employee, less than 1 year","Not for everyone but great pay and experience,","Engineers at Huawei are world class builders and are very open and passionate about new technical ideas. Cutting edge technology is easy to get experience with if you have ambition and a curious mind. You can travel to China and many other countries, and learn every step of the way. Huawei's pay is higher than market rates, typically significantly so. US workers perform advanced development and do not undergo the same treadmill-like lifestyle found in many other software shops. In short, it can be a unique opportunity for someone with an open mind, and for those who like to invent.
","The company has been singled out by the US government as a bad actor, although no evidence of ""backdoors"" has been produced as of yet. This stigma is annoying. People used to a highly organized ""scrum"" culture, or who are not self motivated, will probably be unhappy. People who cannot work well with other cultures probably would be a bad fit.

","-Gave me very little information before joining and mislead me quite a bit. Said I working with certain people but it turned out not to be true. I met very few people before joining. -Give me no work after joining no matter how much I ask for work. Some people seem to have way too much work and some way too little. Management is very passive. For things that are critical they tell employees to get it done and they don't care at all how it gets done(i.e. they are not involved technically). For things that are not critical they expect employees to be super active and get amazing stuff done without having to spend any of their own effort. -Everyone is very political and nobody works together with a common goal. Everything is centrally controlled from China and you can't see the organization chart in China, only the US. It is very unclear what the management structure is. Most people will have multiple managers, some in the US and some in China. -A lot of brainwashing by the HR team during their orientation. They play lots of videos and try to hypnotize you into thinking you are saving the world. They make you accept a book that was published by some executives and I'm suprised they don't force you to read it out loud. -They are paranoid about information security and have lots of restrictions which make it impossible to get anything done at work. The management tells us to violate some of the company policies in order be able to get at least some stuff done and the IT people turn a blind eye to this. People are constantly getting in trouble for violating some company policy. -Almost all of the important information for doing engineering work is located in China so it's almost impossible to get anything done in the US. All of the decision making is made there. -There is no socializing at our company and it's very racially segregated. -Managers are very non-technical and the skill level of most employees is low. -During the process of setting personals goals for the year for which we will be evaluated there was no interaction with management besides extremely vague statements about what they wanted me to accomplish. When I tried to get clarification I was blown off. -The company strategy is to just hire very experienced senior engineers in the US with more than 15yrs experience and milk them for knowledge. HR and management don't try to hide this at all. They are not interested in having a permanent presence in the US and developing the younger generation here. Huawei employs about 180,000 people. They are constanty shifting around what people do in China so the people there are not experts at anything. -The English skills of many of the people in the US and most people in China are very poor. The communication style is also very indirect. The good thing is the people in the US make a honest effort to communicate well(sometimes it's still not good enough though). However, the bad thing is many people in China will not respond to numerous emails you send them. There is no spirit of working towards a common goal with them. -Nobody on my project seems to care about doing a good job. No matter how active I tried to be to promote good ideas and directions nobody responds to you at all. It shows the attitude of the people there.

This is a cheater company. Huawei don't keep it's promises. You have to point out that company didn't keep it's promises and if you create a big issue around that then only you can get those compensation other wise management and hr will raise the finger to each other, managers will say it's hr fault and hr will say it's managers, ultimately you will be the looser. Huawei cheates on salary also, they will offer something and give you less. If you complain they will tell it was a mistake in offer letter your actual is whatever you are getting now.

No opportunity to express yourself unless you are in high position, your voice will not get heard anyway if you in low positions; 4. Lack of transparency. badly hierarchy system; 5. interpersonal relationship seem very important, get your nose brown or be very very careful by the office politics. 6, The Ipswich office did not seems like big company branch. not the size of big company there anyway.

Business Outlook
Pros
Must be the most unorthodox -non-swedish company to work for in Sweden. Salary is high in comparison (otherwise nobody would work for them) High tempo, intense, every day can be different Gives a feeling that if you can succeed here, you can succeed anywhere Chain of command can be hectic and conflictuous (relationship-based and not process-based)
Cons
As non-swedish as it gets; Crazy work style, relationship-based. There is not a company directory, and even if it existed one, chinese won't reply to you if they don't know who you are or they are not ordered to talk to you (again, the relationship based-workflow) Only chinese in higher positions (if you see a ""westerner"" there, it is just for show, no real power)

Supposedly , improves your technical skills but you might need time to digest high complexity. Leuven is clean city much cleaner than brussel.
","It used to be a nice place where to work formelly named M4S, since then most of the founders have quited 1 or 2 years after it becames Huawei Technologies R&D Belgium nv. Later, just like in IMEC the management is beeing maintained under flemish control. Basically, in this new satelite branch of huawei you are squeezed like a lemon just like with chineses in china absolutely no work-life balance whatsoever !! The management is anyway very very centralized, the local flemish managers do what they are told to do and they add an authentic tough and harsh flemish management style much appreciated by the chinese and that's why they are kept in their position. 1. There is no possibility to discuss the overwhelming workload (for instance 3 tape out at the same time) because anyway in changhai they work so hard and even on saturday. btw, your boss may call you on sunday to work if necessary, make sure to be reachable. 2. People are so stressed and tired that they could even become ill, this was true even for a chinese girl in shanghai ( she quit job) and an indian lady. Of course, this will be denyed and covered not to damage the huawei brand. 3a. Specfications can change at anytime, sometimes you have the feeling that they don't know exactly what they want. Even worse, the team competing with your group in shanghai knows the spec change before the team your belong to. 3b. if you're a project manager, you are not forgiven if you did not cope for the change in specs. The punishment can be as scornful as not invited to show for groupe picture to be sent to huawei central management. 4. Huawei claim that the company belongs to the employee, however, If you are not chinese, you cannot have shares in the company which is quite unfair. 5. if you have a made a technical mistake your name and picture might be shown somehere in shanghai, the chinese way to punish people. anyway your name is in a kind of blacklist. 6. If you are a designer or layouter probably if you want to stay in huawei leuven, you might be senior but that's it you stay in your field and you probably cannot be part of the management unless you're flemish. 7. awful cantine/ it rains almost every day in winter/renting a decent flat in leuven is costly. At the time of writing this, at least 6 people have a left Huawei Technologies R&D Belgium nv in less than a year.

This is a big bonus as this workplace may be the only place in Istanbul where you can enjoy the most authentic Chinese food. And it has definitely a very high value to price ratio. You can meet and work together with young and ambitious colleagues who are currently enrolled in graduate programs.
","Managers are not experts in their assigned projects, even more they do not seem to be interested in developing their skills. People with already acquired research and project management skills are ignored and not acknowledged for no good reason. You are assessed for your so-called ""performance"" every six months. However, this is not analytical as the requirements set are vague and change very often during the term. You are not given clear objectives that you can tackle, thus your assessment correlates with your closeness with your manager and whether she/he likes you or not.

2018-10-04,Anonymous,,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Unprofessional , unequal workplace, but growing company","Huawei is a Chinese fastgrowing company with international presence and a success story in telco network equipments, where it became the marketleader by first underpinning prices of competitors at any cost, secondly by relentless servility towards customers and thirdly, by finally also becoming a producer of well-engineered hardware. The company 's most recent success story as manufacturer of highend smart devices further boosted growth and earned more awareness for the company's brand. Definitely has a good growth perspective, and also provides growth for employees- if and only if you are mainland Chinese. For Westerners the salaries are generally good, and if you are lucky, you may get a bonus. Chinese persons can get absolutely huge bonuses, so this is a great place for Chinese to work. The technology and the products are often exciting and the growth story is amazing.
","Sadly, Huawei is a place that has no viable work culture for European or US people. Moreover, it openly favors Chinese managers and employees over other nations, in development, bonuses and simply in every aspect of work. Western people never can exercise any influence, never be trusted and never be equal to Chinese, no matter the knowledge, the performance or loyalty. Western people are simple tools to service Chinese, any Chinese actually. It is actually amazing that this totally unequal-opportunities employer is allowed to function legally in Europe. Information and communication is often Chinese first, sometimes in Chinese only. The work culture is averse to logical or advance planning, plans are never valid for long and no one cares. The company is highly-highly hierarchic, resents open discussions and change, bottom up innovation or proactivity is frown upon and not desired. Managers are 95% Chinese , and many of them are thrown into positions and markets they have zero knowledge about, as part of expat policy for Chinese at Huawei. In 2-3 years, By the time the manager actually understands and becomes more able to perform the job, he is made to leave for a next assignment. The mentality is military-oriented: do not think just execute anything on order. If there is no superior who gives an order, nothing happens, business can rot, no one cares. is lats-minute everything, and due to,this and due to lack of understanding customers and markets, actions are often desperate actions, hence stress levels are often high. The technology is exciting, the products can be often proud of and salary may be good for Westerners, but the daily irrationality, the fact to be just a tool,or best a tolerated 2nd rate employee, the lack of equal chance to grow as a person, the total lack of respect or appreciation by management goes against the heart and head of every decent Western person..., sooner or later you feel that your capabilities are fading, your soul and passion is being killed and ultimately, you end up frustrated and shrinking.

2018-09-27, Senior Marketing Manager,"London, England, England","Former Employee, more than 1 year",Not a fun place to work,"Huawei is a highly successful company that has come to dominate the telecoms infrastructure industry in a few short years. It offers high quality, innovative products and invests heavily in R&D. Huwei has simply out competed Ericsson and Nokia by first undercutting them and then out engineering them. The company invests hugely in engineering, but is no particularly creative or innovative.
","Huawei is not a good work environment for the Western workforce. It is a Chinese company with some international presence. Westerners are tolerated at best. No Westerner can have any real authority or influence. Westerners aren't really trusted and the cultural expectations of a Western workforce are barely acknowledged by Chinese Management. The organization is hugely hierarchical and fast-track managers are often catapulted into roles that they have no understanding of and no real ability in. Decision making is highly centralised, as are budgets. Forward planning and reasonable treatment of employees is rare. The companies Personal Business Objectives drive a lack of cooperation and ""big picture"" thinking. People focus purely on their personal business objectives and the financial rewards they bring (and the rewards can be huge) without any real analysis of whether they are the ""right"" things to do. This all contributes to a highly unpleasant atmosphere. Knee-jerk reactions, last-minute decision making, lack of consultation and micro-management. Huawei pays well, but you sell your soul, and no (Western) employees really enjoy the company.

2018-09-24,Anonymous,"Brussels, Brussels","Former Employee, more than 1 year",Terrible Company... Awful Experience...,"- Racism towards local employees: There is no trust between Chinese employees and the local, some meetings are organized only between Chinese. I have been working on projects in which the local colleagues were not aware of the development of the project because the Chinese colleagues would not include them in the email exchanges. - Heavy processes: There is a process for everything, sometimes only in Chinese. The request has to be explained again and again to N+1 level... It's time and energy consuming... - No balance between private and professional life: Some departments are in the office on Saturday, trainings are organized during the weekend and as many say in the company: “Overtime is the culture of Huawei"". - Poor language skills: English is said to be the official working language of the company; however, the level of English is extremely poor, processes and emails are only available in Chinese from a certain level. In the high management, some are unable to speak French, Dutch, and their English is so poor, sometimes even impossible to understand. - Poor management skills: The new management team is worrying… I had to explain how to manage project to my manager… Everything was urgent and last minute. For example, that meeting that was organized at 17.00 from 18.00 to 22.00 on a Friday. - Worthless values: They are written everywhere in the office, but you won’t experience them… Except for one: customer first (after the CEO though). Respect is non-existing and “thank you” is rare. There is no space for openness nor initiative, you have to follow the process. I won’t even talk about integrity. As of team work, it applies only between locals or between Chinese. Huawei’s HR strategy is quite superficial: if you want to leave, they will offer a raise; if you are reluctant to join, they will offer a “good salary”.

","No work life balance. Calls at midnight, weekends, annual leaves, at hospitals. Expected to work 24/7 as human robot. No respect to human rights, employee rights and work/life balance. What's worse, it's normal to many Huawei employees to call you at hospital bed, or your children’s birthday party, they expect you to come office. Bad culture. Company culture is based on Army culture: rules, regulations, violations, punishments. Locals are treated as second class employee aka slaves, never promoted to key C-level positions. Your position will be replaced with Chinese or a new Local at any given time. Firing is the easiest act in Huawei. Profits before people. Stolen hardwork. You will be asked to do other people (chinese) jobs, but not paid or graded for it. Then, you see Chinese get awards, promotions, salary increases for your hard-work. Because of bad company culture, bad reputation in the market if you work at Huawei. Not recommend anyone to work here. Unless you want to be in Chinese prison for many years, until you get better offer from another company.

As I have another experience with Chinese company, All of them are same. HORRIBLE . They don`t trust foreign colleagues and just their Chinese friends will be promote. Dear Iranian engineers, You should not work at this company cause they don`t respect you and your hard-work and knowledge. There is no life balance. Managers just care about their KPIs not any more. Midd-lvl managers don`t know about edge technologies even, They have not studied in technology field. some of them were army !!!!! Can you believe that ?!

2018-05-08,Anonymous,Bangalore,"Current Employee, more than 10 years",Incredible opportunity for career growth,"1. Fast track career growth - Highly performance driven organization. Work contributions gets recognized. People with exceptional abilities and contribution grow very very fast. 2. Higher Compensation - The Company is in Bangalore not because of cost advantage, but to leverage quality resources and software eco system available locally. They don't shy paying a Tier-1 MNC salary. Company's yearly bonus and stock dividends are very generous and directly proportional to companies profit and revenue. Huawei is a privately owned company by its employees. So good share from the profit earned by company is passed to employees as Bonus, Stock dividend and hikes. 3. Challenging work assignments - You work in product and solutions R&D in ICT domain. Company is very aggressive and positions its product very competitive in market in terms of product features, performance etc. So you get to work on challenging problems most of the time. 4. Chance to work in diverse technologies from Telecom to Cloud, Bigdata, consumer devices etc - Company has diversified portfolio .Has 4 BGs in different Industry segments, and all 4 have R&D teams in India - i. Carrier (Telecom), ii. Enterprise, iii. ","mer (smartphones+other devices) and iv. Cloud. It is easier to move across technologies and domains as long as you have proven/contributed to your current project. Quality of work has never been a concern here. 5. Strong culture, centered around its core values-Customer centricity, Dedication and Self-reflection. This is Huawei's strength and differentiates itself with other MNCs. The orientation of employees towards the company's core value and culture is pretty strong. Most people here are aligned to company's global values and you would find many employees working with the company for more than 10-15 years.
Cons
1. Lower work efficiency due to Communication difficulty with head quarters - Due to language barrier and remote location (from HQ), some times information flow is not consistent. 2. No work from home option. However I see that in recent past, company is more open to acknolowledge this as an issue and providing some flexibility for certain type of work like open source based projects.

The company is definitely a place for young and budding people who aspire for a challenge and are willing to jump in and experience the fast-paced atmosphere. I just spent almost years at Huawei and its been worth the time. The company is young and still growing very fast. Its easy to compare it to already established companies and criticise it but Huawei as I joined it several years ago has come a long way and I believe the future looks bright. The salaries are not bad compared to market average and with a very diverse staff. Mostly Chinese from HQ but I have noticed that this has gradually reduced with the passing years .
","Management needs to eventually ease their foot on the ""Home-Office"" topic and continue with the localization programme, enhancing more local participation in managing the company and also showing more and more trust to our local staff.and employer branding activities . The company can become even more international if we learn to share the authority and trust the non-Chinese to hold top positions and still deliver.

it is uni-culture company or simple a chinese company that has international presence. It will never be considered as a multinational company as always chinese comes first in seizing opportunities, career growth, salary , bonuses and the rest nationalities comes always second. other nationalities are tools used to serve a need and once a chinese person can replace you than you are out of the company. it is a very tough environment with a slot of stress and pressure. if you have a job then stay where you are and dont join as your journey will be always at risk.

2018-01-04, Senior Engineer,Warsaw,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",Only for experienced experts,"1. Company (Chinese personnel) do not care about you at all. You are only a tool for them. It is completely not important what you know, what experience you have, what you can improve. The only important thing what you can delivery in particular moment when Chinese asking about it. More, if you know that their idea is wrong, you cannot improve that because you will be first enemy. 2. Huawei has not management layer. Here is army style commanding. Commander (i.e. your manager, his manager, VP or anybody in charge) has always right. There is nothing special that one day you must go on left feet and on another day left is forbidden. There is not ‘mind storm’. Instead of this is committee management style. It looks like as many Chinese employee are sitting together in a meeting room and they are discussing about any issue or decision to make (even simplest one) for 1,2 or 3h. Finally, most important of them telling everybody that they must forward this topic to HQ in China to get approval. Usually HQ adding another 1-2 weeks to decision process. 3. You are not allowed to communicate with Customers or Subcontractors. All communication must be canalized by Chinese account manager or procurement team. 4. Everybody at Huawei are not sharing any knowledge. There is not technical documentation in English or if you will find some, it is outdated. Any right documentation is in Chinese and you have no permission to read it. 5. You are permanently watched – by CCTV in the office, by special web filters in computer, by key loggers and by special dedicated security cell in the office which connect to your desktop on PC to verify that you are work properly. 6. If you are a ‘core team member’ in a project, you as non-Chinese member will not get any bonuses or this bonus will be very small (according to bonus budget for a core team members) 7. If you established good relations with Customer and delivery successful and approved by Customer POC, you will be kick-off of the project because at this moment huge amount of your Chinese co-workers will try to be in a core team and you will not be necessary (bonus matter) even if after that whole project will collapse. 8. If you done something for Chinese colleague, you should not be surprised that this job finally will be not your success and you will get information that 100% of this work was done by him/her. 9. Any personal development is not welcome. This is waste of time and resources from Chinese point of view. Did I mention that you are a tool? 10. Any trainings, even internal, or vacations will decrease your personal score of working hours what finally will have an impact on your yearly score. Thera are many regulations that in such cases you will not be able to get higher score than because of many things. 100% working hours is possible only if you will not leave even single working calendar day. 11. Usually you will have in a contract some standard job position without job description – Huawei common is that you will need to do anything is requested and on visit card you will have some strange job positions including VP level (depends on project and Customer). You will need to have even 8-10 different visit cards with your name and different job positions (with base salary level).
","Salary – but remember that you must have good negotiations on start. Later on, will not be too many possibilities to increase salary level. If Huawei needs you, you can request 30-50% bigger salary than market average and it will be accepted.

","Huawei, with its military background, tends to have a culture that can encourage a battlefield-like mentality. This culture is often referred to at Huawei as “wolf culture,” It is culture of cheating, lying, stealing Intellectual Property, stealing designs from one another. ""Kill or be killed"" High level US employees are hired to steal US Intellectual Property. They will tell you that it is not a case during an interview. 2-3 weeks on the jobs you will be threatened with job loss if you do not provide product design of your previous employer. Once they have all they need you will be promptly terminated. People work here 1-3 years. It is most unethical company I ever worked for. They are currently less then 900 US employees, They hire 300 a year and they currently have 250 openings. You do the math how long you will last :) Avoid this horrible company.

2017-11-23,Anonymous,,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",This is worst global corporation I have ever work so far. Don't go there if you are non-Chinese.,"The only one benefit to be Huawei employee is base salary - a bit better then offered by competitors. Reason - European employee are not happy to work for Chinese being paid by average salary. Be aware this might be not valid any more: due shrinking Huawei global market and profit in percentage you should expect to be a cheap outsourced employee, not a real employee which may get yearly bonus as well as.
","1. Non Chinese don't have any single chance for development to improve your career. There is no valuable trainings at all available, these a little bit valuable are only in Chines. That makes you are getting quickly behind everyone on the market at technology goes fast. 2. There is no relationship between your work efficiency and your bonus. Doesn't matter how you work bonus will be paid mostly to Chinese. Exceptional non-Chinese might receive valuable bonus. I knew only one such person while I have worked for Huawei. 3. There is no work life balance at all. You must at work between 9.00AM and 9.00PM including Saturdays as well as if you want to be treated well. Otherwise you are just a non-Chinese tool or face for the customer with no future in the corporation. Also you Chinese colleagues will be nice and smile to you if you will do their work. There is no any chance Chinese employee will help you later. It does not pay off for them at all. Business trips - no credit cards, no cash in advance. You must cover everything by yourself in advance (accommodation, meal, even flights), then have a hope your expenses will be refunded in less than 1 month. That means you may wait for your money back even up to three months. You simply offer a free mortgage to your Chinese employer all the time :) 4. Management 111% in Chinese style. That means there is no management in terms of Western standards. You will never know what your manager think about you or what you done not properly or what you should do. 5. Culture and values - Chinese only. Forget about any team night-out, any team mates meetings after work. Chinese (more then half of company) do spend its time only with Chinese. There is a Chinese Great Wall between Chinese and non-Chinese.

Huge team in regional and HQ for your queries but they may not able to give you exact answer, but they are very kind to assist you. Very huge learning database, you can find many things that you need inside so less dependancies on counterparts support
","Meetings and training after working hours or weekend, all things last minute, arrangement and cancellation, no respect for people’s personal life and time. If you have family commitment, its hard, the culture do not consider your situation. Many processes, and because of the turn over then not everyone is familiar with it. The overtime is not due to getting unfinished work done but more due to the pressure from management that need to overtime to show that you really works hard ..............

","Average working hours is 12. Sometimes sleep in the office. If we ask leave for personal work, then manager asks what is personal work. Manager approves leaves only when sick. The management is mostly under the control of Huawei HeadQuarters. Spend the whole day in the office, go to home just to sleep. We need to take permission of manager everyday even if we want to go to home after working till 12:00 pm. They will call us whenever needed and ask us to attend office. Getting to HQ is like a hell. Work, work and work. Everday everynight until every issue is completed. Otherwise stay in the office solving the issue till morning. Don't sleep. They are not worried about our health.

It was a really rewarding experience. Huawei gave me many opportunities to learn more and more in my professional Networking area. Unfortunately the political and economic situation in my country truncated this successful relationship. Many economic incentives to achieve goals, which favored competition within the group members. I was encouraged and helped to exploit my ability to coordinate activities of the group I was in charge of, and to use my creativity to be more managerial and less operative. Those years with Huawei were hard work, sometimes with almost 72-hour shifts with very few hours of rest, but no one complained because the work was exciting and challenging. I do not know if in other countries Huawei works in the same way, but I have to say that this is a job for people capable of managing stress, who wants to be challenged daily and feel satisfied to have achieved it.

","Huawei is unfortunately Chinese and not international company and this is shown by many things, for instance, all managers are Chinese nationals with open racism and sexism to employees and local people. They look like someone transported from middle ages just yesterday. Cheating, stealing, lying and bribing is very normal to them, also all business information are kept with Chinese only. But anyhow, if you can keep away from direct contact to the management, you can learn a lot from the projects and top technology, so it depends a lot on this or you might be lucky to have some naturalised Chinese who treat others with respect.

","The culture is a point that should be taken into consideration. Typical example is saying 'yes' but never following this up or keeping word.

As if they are not even Huawei's employees. Huawei management style can best be described as a game of shadows.

2017-08-22, Senior NOC Engineer,Riyadh,"Current Employee, less than 1 year",Exploitation thy name is Huawei Saudi Arabia. No increment in 5 years.,"If you want to learn how to exploit those dependent on you for their bread & butter you should join Huawei Saudi Arabia. I don't see any other pro(s) in working with Huawei Saudi Arabia.
","Telecome Industry in Saudi Arabia has been hostage to a parasite named Huawei for some time now. It entraps operators and defeats competitors with attractive rates, and is then willing to suck the last drop of blood out of its employees to compensate for their cheaper rates. Those employed directly have plenty to complain about, but those of us who have been hired through sub-contractors are dealt with by Huawei Saudi Arabia in ways renowned slavers of the yore would be proud of. I had been hired 5 years back on a sub-par salary. I had joined it then partly because I was desperate, and the job-market was volatile in Saudi Arabia (it has been volatile for quite a few years now). And partly in the hope that in due time, with increments I will get there. I had recevied assuarances of increment, in due time, from the lower level management too of . However, with the passage of time I realised that I had made a blunder. Despite having received excellent evaluation marks/grades from my superiors over the last 5 years, I have yet to see an increment; not a single penny. The system is so messed up, that new comers who joined our team this year, without any prior experience, are getting more than us who joined 5 years ago. What left me hopeless is that two other colleagues of mine, who joined an year before me, have not had any increment in 6 years. One of them resigned this year for this very reason and went back to his home-country. I too, am now actively looking for another job. So before joining Huawei Saudi Arabia, make sure that you have negotiated a compensation amount that you should be comfortable with for a long long time. Otherwise you'll rue the day you joined Huawei Saudi Arabia, like me.

You need to pay the restaurant all the time with your own money and cant expense anything. -It’s a Chinese company: with good and cons, Good: Interesting different culture, Poor: Chinese documents, discussion, decision, management: you don’t speak Chinese? Then you are just nothing in the company. Lack of strategy: only tactical: provide low price product: only box moving company approach Lack of common language: most of them barely speak English, and if one of my sales goal is to achieve my quota, one of their goal is to meet CxO here: its always unproductive and a total mess as no one understand what is their message, which by the way is only low tactical one. Lack of management: our managers thing they have experience, but don’t know our market: every 2 years Huawei relocate the Chinese management, so they just don’t pay attention of local market but more focus on short term deals even if this kills the market or relationship with customers Lots of good Chinese resources, but management is demotivating everyone’s (including Chinese engineer’s). Lots of other issues that makes me thinking there is a huge gap to be fulfilled between our worlds, Huawei has certainly great product, engineer and R&D but the management is a cast completely hermetic to the business world and rules and have no idea of how business runs.

","Management is terrible. If you are not asian you will never get promoted or treated fairly. The c-level people were all asian and wanted to run the enterprise business in america like they did in china, cutting peoples pay, cutting benefits, cutting everything. I was part of the sales team and they changed the comp plan every quarter making it impossible for me to make comission. They provided no training, no plan, no guidance to achieve my goals. Traveling was a joke. Our budget for meals a day was $40 and hotels was $90 a day. When I did travel some nights I could barely afford motel6. This company is so cheap that they don't even offer coffee. Only water. They never celebrated anything. If you were non-asian you were looked down at. They spoke Mandarin all though out the office extremely loud and it sounded like a 3rd world country call center, and when your on the phones trying to make sales, its impossible with all the foreign language and shouting. Don't expect anyone in HR to help you with anything or payroll, you get the run around all the time. One month our medical got cancelled because they forgot to pay their premium so everyone lost their medical benefits and had to re-enroll. Turn over is extremely high because they are so un-organized and treat their employess so unfairly. Again, if your not asian dont expect anything out of them because they discrimiate against a lot of people within the company. They have actually been sewed on numerious occasions because of this.

All decisions and flows are micromanaged by mainland headquarters. No products are produced for North America. No leadership only follower behavior. All programs are offshored within 2 years of being started. All documents are encrypted and time out within months. All design flows are obsoled by HQ. You clearly feel like you work for a China only company. There is a China first mantra and the company exists to provide access to silicon valley. However no projects are adaquetely resourced, only chinese engineers are encouraged and all employees turn over after 5 years. All projects are bid to win, unresourced, required to work with China teams, told thet are overpriced and underperform. No information is shared on requirements or usage, making it difficult to optimize systems. Nightly meetings with mainland staff and frequent trips to mainland are the norm. Benefits (medical, etc) are marginal. If you dont speak the language you are at a severe disadvantage. Constant turnover of management and staff. Missions are not long term. Constant project justification and status instead of empowering teams.

","1. DO NOT join this company in USA, especially if you are on H1B. They have a history of hiring people and firing them once the project is done. If you are on H1B, it can jeopardize your career. For GC and US Citizens, only reason you can work for this company is if they pay you well above the market compensation levels, but even then it is not worth it because of reasons stated below. Many companies are paying similar and not abusing their employees. 2. Poor Management. No peer technical discussion. Managers will ask you to create a project plan assuming multiple resources available. Then they will not provide the resource, and use the project plan that you created to track you back, under totally unrealistic deadlines. Managers will provide wrong directions and hold you responsible for their incorrect decision making. 3. Lack of work ethics/decorum: Managers will pretend that they are doing you a favor by paying you more than people employed in China. They openly say in meetings that “you are paid 5x compared to Chinese employees so you should work 5x more”. No effort estimate will be done for the work. You will go to meetings and they will review the items not done and humiliate you for what is not done. Again, I have been told, “I don’t care how it will be done or how many hours is needed, it needs to be done in 2 days”. They will formally track your progress against an unrealistic schedule, probably because they would need this documentation for legal purposes when people are fired 4. Lack of power in US: Most decisions are made in China HQ. So your manager will blame you if your group missed a bug. Everyone higher up blames people down the hierarchy to save their jobs . Your manager will expose your weakness and hide your strength, so that if some thing wrong happens, they can blame and fire you while retaining their own job. This is true whether you are a manager or an employee. 5. Poor infrastructure: IT infrastructure is poor. Compute resource is limited. Too much restriction in accessing documents etc causes loss in productivity. 6. Zero Training: Forget about training sessions. You will not learn anything because there are no training videos, poor documentation and even zero discussion. 7. Competition over co-operation: Managers here promote a culture of competition over co-operation. China folks don’t trust US folks and vice versa. Everyone in US wants to be manager, no one wants to work 8. Communication problem + time zone issues: You will have to work with China folks starting from 7pm. Most of them don’t understand English properly 9. Lack of diversity: Practically zero female engineers and less than 10% non-chinese people 10. Cafeteria: food sucks

2017-03-20,Anonymous,"Reading, England, England","Former Employee, more than 1 year",Business culture and ways of working for non Chinese employees,"Compensation and reward is 15 to 20% higher than similar roles elsewhere. Working for a large growing technology company. Friendly colleagues and a ""can do"" collaborative attitude to work.
","This is a large global international Chinese company rather than a true global multinational enterprise and there is very little appetite for change. The environment is uncompromisingly Chinese, HQ centric and there is little support provided to non Chinese employees to enable them to carry out their roles effectively. I have worked for global MNE's for 20 years as a professional subject matter expert but was completely unprepared and unsuited for the working environment at Huawei. The internal language is Chinese and the standard of business English, both written and spoken, is very poor making it difficult for non Chinese speaking employees to understand what is required from them or to engage meaningfully with Chinese colleagues on technical issues. The lack of Chinese language skills meant I was unable to carry out my role effectively despite having the requisite technical knowledge and experience. Huawei boasts that 70% of its UK employees are locally hired, which may be the case, but predominantly this is from the local Chinese community for all roles except those which require specific professional skills or expertise. In my opinion it does not provide a suitable work environment for non Chinese employees unless they are prepared to accept a very heirarchical business culture and way of working where everyone is expected to follow globally defined processes to the letter and accept that compliance with these processes will be assessed, measured, audited, scored and ultimately rewarded or punished. There is no trust between HQ and internationally based employees. There is a total lack of autonomy for locally hired staff no matter how senior or expert they are. Subject matter experts are regarded as internal consultants rather than business decision makers. All business decisions are made between Chinese local management and HQ in China and all discussions and meetings are conducted in Chinese with little or no opportunity for the non Chinese staff to participate. I am used to a significant amount of autonomy when carrying out my specialist role coupled with the ability to contribute opinions, ideas and experience to influence ways of working in my functional organisation both locally and globally. I was told that this was one of the main reasons I was being hired but ultimately this did not come to fruition. It was clear that I was to have no opportunity to contribute or influence global processes beyond an initial ""knowledge dump"" of the ways of working of my previous employer who was a competitor of Huawei. I was there to be harvested of the knowledge I had in my head and once this had occurred I was ""put out in the field"" to work. Huawei are happy to buy a stable of racehorses and put them to work pulling ploughs every day.

","Let's start with a previous review stating that Huawei is an equal opportunity employer. Whoever wrote that probably is now struggling to hire talents for the company so he/she had to say nice things about this company... All recruitment plans are controlled by the HQ in China, and they are the most racist, sexist, and ageist I've ever encountered in my career. Denying any application of colored people has been their usual practice even in London and Santa Clara. There are some Indians working here in Santa Clara, but they are trying very hard to hire as few as possible going forward. Local Chinese who work in HQ are very good at playing a game called: 'ohhh I'm so busy this job is killing me but first, let me take a 2 hour nap after lunch. ' If you want to know the full picture of what locals they tend to hire, go to Quora. Sadly, they're also the ones more valued by the company. If you're younger than 40, and still aspired to make a career for yourself, do not join this company. If you're older than 40, providing for a family of 4-5, income matters a lot and you don't mind office politics in a Chinese company, and good at being a 'yes-man', then might as well. After all, the pay is alright. Although be aware, they also can find any reason to fire you in a blink of an eye.
