5 Dec 2020 - Product Manager in Menlo Park, CA
Recommend
CEO Approval
Business Outlook
Pros
- Decent peers - Metrics driven culture - Global impact - Lots of teams to choose from
Cons
- Terrible WLB: This depends on the team but generally FB hires less people per product compared to peers, so the amount of work is always high for PMs. Privacy, compliance, integrity, policy and similar regulatory stuff, albeit much needed, has added a ton of work, but the expectation of shipping fast is still there. Which means no WLB. Many 15+ hour days in a month are common. - Low growth: Hard to become a people manager in this company unless you’re really lucky. - Leveling is a total mystery. People who advance are usually those whose managers are willing to give them a great review at any cost. - Middle management is filled with old timers who've never worked anywhere else, or some people who probably got in because they knew someone. Decision making is horrible leading to a lot of teams with tons of churn and low morale. - No patience to build lasting products. Projects that need nurturing are shelved and the only ones that continue are those that Zuck personally cares about. You have 6 months to show massive progress, or else your product is done. - Reorgs are as common as oxygen at FB. This causes a ton of headache to have to re-start every so often. - Business has serious headwinds due to things like signal loss caused by privacy climate and anti-trust legislation.

2020-12-01, Self,"Phoenix, AZ",Former Employee,Former employee 2011*,"Facebook marketing team... B2B sales. When I learned what my job would be I felt a little intimidated, however, the management and training staff were excellent. It is very difficult to get selected for this job, so this is one of my most memorable accomplishments. You're not really in until you've trained and passed a mock call. Definitely not an easy mock call. Not alot of my training class went on to continue working there. The work environment was relaxed, business casual dresscode required, but it just felt easygoing on the floor, not all high stress, high powered call floor where everyone is yelling sales stats and talking crazy to a potential client to get the sale. They continued on the job trainings as necessary. There were many opportunities for lateral moves, and promotions. Sadly, the reason I had to leave was because of a family emergency, that became an ongoing issue.
","What was offered to potential clients may have been a bit too costly. Most businesses contacted were small brick and mortar, mom and pop shops who just couldn't afford to pay what the programs cost. As for the enployees, HR, and management, absolutely no cons that I can think of.

2020-11-28, Research Scientist,"Menlo Park, CA","Former Employee, more than 3 years","Growth, impact, culture and compensation, though with some costs.","Awesome place to learn about engineering and management. At least, in a big company at scale. You can almost live on campus. I guess I mostly spent on rent and gas. Free food, showers, gym, ~700 dollars on external wellness activity, paternity leave, and lots of small perks to simplify your life. FB fosters quite a friendly culture. At least, on the level of engineers. Semiannual reviews partially evaluate how good your relationships with the colleagues. FB is very good at employee retention. Management will try hard to find interesting projects for you. Lots of projects that may bring a great impact. Quite unique projects at scale. Lots of pocket communities with interesting activities. Good compensation.
","Lots of big politics around the company. There is always pressure from the government, society, the media, and even from own employees represented by a vocal left-leaning group. You will also get the part of this pressure as an employee. Noisy environment. Sometimes it's good to have people around, but often you'll find yourself distracted. The company likes open spaces, MPK 20 is a living nightmare, though MPK 21 was designed better. No digital nomad options, except big work-from-home mode right now. Code quality is diverse. Some open-source libraries/frameworks are brilliant. Check folly or react. The non-public part totally depends on the team. HQ, the biggest part of the company, is located in Menlo Park. The place has a nice nature around but has certain issues with the rent price, infrastructure, and gender ratio. Young unmarried man should think twice before moving to the Bay Area, .

","I have enjoyed working at Facebook but as a POC, I do feel that the lack of diversity has affected the quality of work we do, and diluted the creative culture at Fb. Creative teams across the company are very white, and mostly male. While I'm excited to see more roles open up in Facebook for creatives, I worry that it affords teams and management opportunities to hire more white people. Instead of bringing in someone with a different experience that is talented and deserving of an opportunity. Sadly, I've seen BIPOC candidates get shortlisted, only to not make the cut for arbitrary reasons. 'Not a good fit' is a poor reason for someone who spent the time interviewing with us with a stella portfolio. I worry that teams are only bringing in certain candidates to meet some sort of quota or to appear ""exhaustive"" in their search, just so that they can hire another white person. I'm tried of observing these performative acts of diversity from creative leaders across teams and hope that this changes. We can do better, we should do better.

","The biannual review cycle and the focus on ""impact"" makes an endless treadmill of overworking to make sure you get a good review. The company is very unprofessional in its working style where there is little teamwork and many people who try to dump the hard work on you while they chase revenue gains for the review cycle. There is no real career progression and management will do musical chairs and swap your role. I only got to do what I thought I was hired for 18 months.

The ""don't talk to me unless you've got a prototype in hand"" culture can feel like it's stifling ideas (even though it's a very reasonable reaction against pie-in-the-sky proposals). Proper architecture and code quality can be big problems. There's a strong emphasis on social networking as a means of getting things done. For introverts this can be unduly difficult, and even for extroverts it can come across as a triumph of personality and schmoozing over sound engineering principles. There is a strong emphasis on trying to fabricate relationships in order to have impact, which can feel extremely deceitful.

I came from another large tech company, and there is no comparison in terms of the way employees are able to bring their authentic selves to work. Make no mistake, however, working at Facebook is not easy, and it's not for everyone. In my mind, these things are still pros, but definitely need to be called out - super fast-paced, high bar for excellence, a ton of autonomy and freedom, and huge opportunity for impact. The opportunity is there to do amazing things at Facebook, you just have to grab it.
","Although we are a very large tech company, sometimes we still think we are a start-up. There are processes that one would think should be in place by now that are not. Ways of working can be complex with lots of gray areas that can sometimes slow work down. And of course, FB is polarizing, just in and of itself. Disagreement with leadership decisions is common, but civil discourse is encouraged.

Surrounded by very smart, experienced people, who are top in their field 2. A lot of non-tech opportunities, esp. for those who are not SWEs such as folks in HR, Operations, Research, Recruiting, Branding, etc. 3. Supportive employee resource groups such as Black@ and BlackWomen@ which I found has helped me a lot as a black woman living in the Bay 4. Global cross-functional teams collaboration, and worldly impact of the work I do. I'm non-tech, and I still get to work with engineers and other orgs on projects and even get to hack with them in Hackathons! 5. Candid and tough conversations are carried out within the company among employees using Workplace, which have led to overall updates to policies, and also in the products and services we provide to people globally. It's not always pretty or easy to do (sometimes it can get bumpy); but the fact that we can have these discussions in our teams and from Zuck as a company means a lot to me, especially coming from my experience in the past where my leaders didn't even acknowledge current events and the plight of others. 6. Benefits and Perks! There are so many amazing benefits that have truly saved me-- medical insurance, mental health support through Lyra (for you and family members) have helped so much especially during Covid times. 7. So many other things other than Facebook, Instagram and Oculus to work on! The company has grown and work that we do esp. in AR/VR keeps me excited to work here, as well as research that we're doing.
","1. Sometimes moving so fast can caused projects (non-tech) to experience multiple iterations when a longer time line may have yielded a ""one-and-done"" result 2. Would love more diversity and people of color in higher leadership positions. 3. With the increase in company size over a short span of time, I've notice that there are folks that are hired on that do not align with our mission and values. This can cause tension within the teams, and some managers do not address these head on. 4. On some occasions work week can be quite long, from my experience. When dealing with a global project with multiple stakeholders, hours of work can be a pain esp. when you're in late night meetings or early morning (i.e 1AM PST when with APAC for example.). I find this more of a given depending on your role however.

There is no tuition reimbursement - The company says to be your authentic self, but if you don't drink the Kool-aid you're going to have a bad time - The company is driven by semi-annual performance reviews that create perverse incentives which emphasize impact over quality and short term over long term goals. - There are too many meetings and most are run inefficiently - The company uses Workplace (Facebook for work) for internal communications which, like Facebook, has a low signal to noise ratio unless you ignore most things - The company is process heavy in many areas but the only way things get done is when people ignore the processes

","Endless bureaucracy - the amount of time spent convincing leadership and XFNs that something is worth doing far exceeds the amount of time spent doing it. Politics and turf wars - multiple teams are competing for ownership over the same decisions. Directors will employ their teams as pawns to gain turf and evaluate them on their ability to do so. People treated as competition, not partners - FB will intentionally pit peers to out-do each other, seeing this as a motivational tactic. Churn and turnover - as priorities, ownership, and methodologies change, those part of the prior regime are cast aside.

","Working at Facebook wasn't a positive experience. You'll definitely meet some great people amongst your peers (lovely, smart people), but you'll almost certainly meet some awful managers too (at best, ineffectual & negative; at worst, toxic). The managers I experienced talked to the team disrespectfully, as if we were children, on a regular basis and always in a negative way, never encouraging. New people to the team were always shocked initially. The 'heightened candidate experience' that they insist on for hiring, is out the door once you're actually on board and I found it a cut-throat, toxic environment, where everyone is watching their back. They are very heavy on KPIs to an agency-level. The scope of the job is also very narrow due to the size of the org, so you very quickly find yourself bored and although I undoubtedly was learning some new skills, I was losing some I valued that I had acquired in previous roles. They don't live out the values they profess, or that are reflected in the benefits package, so you might find yourself unsupported through difficult, personal times and wondering if all the great benefits are worth feeling so demeaned. They're not.

2020-09-28, Research Scientist,"New York, NY","Current Employee, more than 3 years",Extensive Support and Brilliant Coworkers,"One of the biggest perks is working with some of the most intelligent, thoughtful and honest coworkers anywhere in the world. No matter how big of a fish you have been in previous ponds, you will be a small fish here and have incredible space to grow. There is incredible freedom to pursue the projects you want in the way that you want as long as you can defend why they are important to the company. While less than it was in the past, there is incredible transparency and accountability from leadership internally. Your manager will support and promote you in a way that is unprecedented at most other companies. Most importantly, the work you do affects millions or billions of people - even seemingly tiny tasks like making the app update 1 second faster or tweaking a model to deliver 1% more interesting content can have a large positive impact on the world. While it doesn't always succeed, the company takes diversity and social justice seriously and it shows in project initiatives and hiring.
","It's a big company with entrenched (if sometimes informal) power structures. As much as people try to be transparent, there are backdoor politics that affect your role and career that you might not learn about until much later, if ever. There will be constant pressure to specialize - many of the new skills I've developed here would transfer well to other big tech companies, but be wasted at a startup. Work life balance can go sideways quickly unless you protect yourself zealously. Even in the ""move fast (and we no longer say 'break things')"" culture there is a lot of pressure to not mess up in ways that affect the public negatively - even small mistakes in privacy or integrity have terrible negative effects on potentially millions of people.

I joined during COVID and it became clear extremely quickly how much they deeply care about their employees and their well being. Can work-life balance be challenging in a company full of top performers with high performance expectations? Absolutely! But it is really on you to manage your own time and success. There is no pressure from the organization to work after hours and using your PTO and leave options is greatly encouraged. I personally love the casual and open culture. When they say ""bring your whole self to work"" they mean it. Coming from a more traditional company it took a little time to adapt to this as well as to adjust to how people communicate with each other but now I'm hooked. The opportunities for continued learning and professional growth seem boundless. They really like to promote from within and there are so many resources for building your career based around what interests you the most.

My manager stated that Facebook might not be a great place for me as a parent. I was also penalized for taking time to pump.

Anything which slows developers down is fixed if possible. - Very good internal mobility: bootcamp means you have a good deal of leeway in finding a team, and, after a year internal mobility is encouraged. - Tons of opportunities to make millions of peoples' lives just a little bit better. Like it or not, Facebook's products are used by over a billion people worldwide. There are few places where improvements and fixes can have such a broad reach. - Lots of intellectual challenges: There are many types of challenges in building products for billions of people: technical (scaling and perf), product (how do you make it useful for everyone), regulatory (how to not fall afoul of privacy regulations), security (how to minimize badness that happens due to the products), and more.
","The biggest challenge facing Facebook right now is that it is simultaneously too big to run the way it runs now (with teams trying to fight for impact and all hacking on the same products), and too small to fit with the well-intentioned goals that Mark has for all of the ways that Facebook can help people. A company without any strong sense of unifying purpose tends toward bloat and stagnation. It feels like this is the direction Facebook is heading. The amount of infighting between teams around responsibility and ownership of new features is growing and will only keep accelerating.

","Given Facebook's historical ""move fast"" and autonomous culture, there are a lot of byproducts that make it more difficult to work here than you would expect at this size of company: - Disparate tooling ecosystem and preference for homegrown tools over enterprise tools (which has lots of positives, but in many regards it means reinventing the wheel and bugs) - Siloed teams working on similar things, but not knowing of or talking to each other The other main con is information overwhelm. As a social media company, Facebook is in a unique position to influence and have a stake in social issues that have global impact. For better or worse, that means divisive opinions in the world coexist and are surfaced within the walls of the company and all over our internal workplace. It's hard not to get caught up in this and ""focus on work"" when a lot of what's been surfaced is so deeply engrained in what our product does and/or how our culture should be.

","- Despite having improved, the company is still heavily US and Europe-centric. - Reduced growth opportunities if you are not based in the US or some European locations. - Constant company growth sometimes translate into ever-increasing complex structures that make your job more difficult. - Work and life balance is a challenge that is perceived by almost everyone at the company, but felt differently across locations. Offices outside of the US tend to get less headcount and, with that, you might be working longer hours to make sure you're doing everything you need to.

","Leadership moves from crisis to crisis to crisis. The attention focus is relatively short on the hot issue of the moment and that trickles down to every org. You can be working on the number 1 goal or project from Jan - June and knock it out of the park. Then by July everyone's attention has shifted and your work is no longer relevant. A lot of institutional knowledge is lost this way. The company skews young as well, so there are a lot of inexperienced people who want to make their mark/get their promotions and they work hard but don't get the guidance that would help them work smarter. The result is that some teams take ""done is better than perfect"" and ""ask for forgiveness rather than permission"" to another level, which can make work tedious. Almost everyone comes from elite schools and has great stats so some really lean in extra hard into making themselves stand out, sometimes in ways that aren't the most useful or healthy. There's also a hierarchy Technical people on top, then Business people (cause they make the money) then lawyers then everyone else. People in ops often are at the bottom of the totem pole.

2020-05-24, Engineering Manager,"San Francisco, CA","Current Employee, more than 3 years",People Focused,"Facebook deeply cares about its employees and has built a compelling culture around support and growth. Career growth opportunities are plentiful. If you don't like the team you're on or don't get the support you want from your manger, Facebook empowers you to find new teams or projects. Facebook wants its employees to be invested in their work and to feel connected to its larger mission. If large scale opportunities and growth are important to you, Facebook is a fantastic place to work.
","Facebook's culture is demanding and fast paced. The greatest aspect of working at Facebook is that everyone is very motivated and very smart. The problem with this is that they all expect the very same of you. Holding a very high bar for excellence can certainly be demanding so it's important to make sure you're always carefully paying attention to your own personal work/life balance.

Also helps that you can offset your food expenses at home if you eat on campus. I'm based in MPK so the on/off campus perks are a plenty. You got gyms, an onsite dental / eye clinic, a massage therapist, an acupuncturist, access to campus Ubers and shuttles, the many many food cafes, sweet shops, food trucks, dry cleaning, Ship-It, a nail salon and barber shop, a bike rental/bike repair shop, and if you need to learn how to bike lessons, you can get that too. AR/VR, a print shop, ERO groups, life-style sessions, micro-kitchens - God I miss the micro-kitchens, the numerous off-site perks and discounts, the Dogs@FB Workplace group, the Tiger King@FB Workplace group, the Sad Meals WFH@FB Workplace group, no formal dress code, a park on the roof, ginger shots, Mark's weekly Q&A, other Q&As with various leaders and world experts, work from your desk or work from some random spot, the library, the product vending machine, the FB 15+ cause of how much you'll eat, the health benefits for a single person with no dependents, company stock and 401K, company products (Portal, IG, etc.), and company swag. Yes this is a real review and no I'm not being paid to vomit sweet nothings. In truth, I've never worked for anything like FB and I've worked for some top notch companies at different phases in my life. I love my team, my peers, my org, my leaders. I know it's going to be hard for me to find a replacement should I, someday, decide to leave FB. And while I realize FB isn't rainbows and unicorns cause it has issues, anytime you have people of different ages, genders, nationalities, political leanings, etc. in one place you're going to have issues but its pretty damn close to perfect. I'm over 40 (I feel 20) so I understand that for others my outlook may be a bit different and hell who knows in a few years I may feel different about the company. One thing though, I don't regret the interview loops nor my decision to leave another top tech org in the Bay area. I look forward to FB's evolution and seeing it continue to be successful.
","PTO is alright. The Performance Review process is stressful, feels like I'm prepping to take the SATs, GREs, LSAT or MCAT every 4 months. I'm saddened by the prospect that one day I may no longer view FB as a glorious place and like others pursue other shiny objects in hopes of making more money with less effort.

I talked to a lot of people before accepting the offer, and they convinced me I should give them a chance. I don't regret it at all, as internally you can see how everyone's trying their best to make this company useful for society at large (yes, making money at the same time, but definitely not as the primary driver of decisions being made). In the end I found a job where I got a significant salary boost, I'm tackling very interesting research problems, and work with people whom I appreciate and whose technical expertise I can trust. So I'm very happy with my choice! :)

2020-03-23, Software Engineer,"Atlanta, GA","Former Employee, more than 3 years",Horrible terrible company with worst culture,"Free food, good salary, hype
","At Facebook I got to know what ""gaslighting"" really means. Gaslighting is exactly what is the culture that is imposed top-down by management. It starts at the bootcamp. There, you'll be properly brainwashed how cute and cuddly Facebook is, how unfairly it is being treated by everybody, how great and kind the Czar and his ruling gang is, and how grateful and privileged you (a despicable useless worm) should feel to be here! Right there, in the bootcamp, they will start the abusive treatment by telling you ""why on Earth did we hire you? You do not submit any code during last 24 hours!"" This abuse and fostering of your impostor syndrome will keep going on. Typical Facebook-style management is when you are being repeatedly told ""I have no idea how did you got here, and if how come you were not fired yesterday - but OK, we'll give you one more chance"". This is part of this culture! There is a STACK RANKING! It's in tooling, in manager training materials! The fact that Facebook officially denies doing it is a yet-another confirmation that this company doesn't shy away from crime. Stack ranking means that all colleagues see each other as a competition. When I started my job at Facebook, my closest colleague didn't want to talk to me, because he knew that the better I succeed, the worse is for him. This is very profound and affects everybody: it's a hostile work environment. Performance reviews is a complete sham. There is one ""axis"" which is related to your actual performance. The other 3 (three!) axes (direction, etc.) is a complete baloney, and can be used to justify ANY rating for anyone. All managers are deeply ignorant schmoozers. Cult means there are plenty of taboo topics for which you'll be fired. There are, for example, internal ""non-managers"" groups, which are patrolled for any signs of dissent. If a person posts anything out of line there, this gets straight to his manager and HR. HR is the worst people I've met. They enforce the authoritarian rule ruthlessly and with cynicism. Working at Facebook has permanently damaged my faith in humanity. I realized that people can still do horrible crimes, given enough brainwashing. That people can treat each other like animals, given stack ranking. I wish I never joined this scam of a company, a lousy swamp filled with ghosts who pretend to be humans!

Frequent back stabbing, anonymous feedback that harms you and bullying is rampant within teams. 5. They rely on their ability as the world's largest social media site to get get talented people but do nothing to develop them or encourage honest and fair performance reviews. The PSC process is rigged from the start with low performers getting promoted and actual performers punished for speaking their mind. Its a Yes culture. Don't disagree with anyone if you want to survive here.

2020-02-20, Enterprise Engineer,"Austin, TX","Current Employee, more than 1 year",Software Engineers of the Enterprise World,"- Working on high impact projects which are challenging and meaningful - More flexibility with office locations than traditional SWE roles (e.g. there's EE teams in Austin but no SWE teams) - Hard to imagine a better place to learn and grow as an engineer - A lot of EE teams are continuously finishing projects and beginning new ones, so you can have a lot more variety in what you're working on (which makes it much easier in my opinion to choose projects which you find interesting or you want to learn more about)
","- Hard to switch from EE teams to SWE teams (requires re-interviewing) if you're in one of the big Engineering offices - Since traditional EE roles dealt more with things like Oracle development, you can get the feeling that EE is looked down on by SWE orgs. I think this is changing quickly as the role evolves and people realize the complex problems EE's are solving, but we're not there yet in terms of having the same 'prestige' as SWEs - Deadlines can be tight depending on business needs - It's on you to determine how much you want to work. This is a double edged sword because you can work a ton in order to drive quicker promotions, but also have to be proactive on forcing work/life balance as there's always more work you could be doing.

Employees are technically assessed on many aspects of performance, but the only one my manager focused on was lines of code. - Competitive culture: Constantly talking about PSCs meant everyone on the team was afraid of any appearance that they did something wrong, which created a culture of blaming others and never admitting mistakes. Managers either stayed out of it or made it worse. - Workload: My tech lead set deadlines that were too aggressive and didn’t listen when my teammates and I pushed back, so we were constantly behind schedule. Working late at night and on the weekends consistently was required just to remain a few months behind schedule. - Asking for Help: Several members of my team had to ask for help writing code many times per day. Most of their questions could be quickly solved by typing a few words into a search bar and looking at the first result, but they still asked another engineer any time they encountered something they didn’t already know how to do.

2020-01-30, Product Marketing,"Menlo Park, CA","Former Employee, more than 5 years",Good and the Bad. It really depends on your team,"Facebook has a lot of Pro's but it really depends on the team you land on and the internal politics that surround that particular unit. That is no different than any other company but it can be night and day here. Generally here are the Pros - People: Majority of the other Facebookers are of high quality and surrounding yourself with other smart people can only up your own game. - Benefits: Positive package here overall. They take care of your health, make some life task much easier and try to make life more comfortable. - Technology: Innovative mindset is a big plus but recent years have been more mirror moves with competition to gain an advantage. Good move but for those that want to break the glass into new frontiers, you got to pick the right team. Impact: The opportunity is there for you to embrace.
","Generally here are the Cons: - People / Culture: There is a small minority of leftist that can be loud and push activist agenda's that are in your face. While my own goals can align (leftist) I don't like their approach. This is just society creeping into the corporate world and is seen across Tech in general. It can be toxic and extremely disrespectful. You might find more of this at Facebook due to the nature of the product. Imagine the rest... Pick your team wisely. - Weak Leadership: Lot of new leaders... Experienced leaders may not have much experience with trouble shooting negative situations and come in with a bias. Another point here is the number of Re-Orgs. You might experience multiple changes within a quarter / half and this can drag on for years. - Negative news cycle ... it can be draining but it should be a wake up call to further innovate for a product for today. However... this news cycle is long... I mean looooooong and can be intense at times.

If you think something needs to be fixed at the root cause, you are in trouble, because you need to Move Fast! The company over-focuses on the short term speed rather than long term. I was lied to multiple time by management. I was told my rating depended on the reviews from my peers, but then when the perf came, I realized it is 100% up to the manager regardless of what your peers say. My manager told me constantly I was doing great, then perf came and because I questioned the principles, I had a bad rating. The 360 was useless, management can use if they want to promote you, but if you are not in great terms with your manager, the 360 will be ignored. I was also told multiple times, the company is impact-based and that what matters is impact. After working on a project with another manager, I was told I could not get any credit, since it was not 100% my idea.

2020-01-10, Production Engineer,"Menlo Park, CA","Current Employee, more than 1 year",Excellent Place to Work,"The opportunity that Facebook offers for autonomy and career growth is incredible; coming in as a new grad PE I have the opportunity to grow based on merit and performance, not time in the role. Flexibility in when I work, how I prioritize my projects, and the scope of my work is invigorating and makes me excited to come to work each day. The company is mission-driven to a great extent, and I have been impressed with the way we have owned up to prior mistakes and fixed them head on. The Production Engineering role is well respected within the company, and the importance of reliability and scaling increases as our services reach more of the world. As a PE you will gain the knowledge necessary to build and operate real hyperscale systems capable of providing services to billions of people. My team is comprised of some of the smartest, experienced engineers I have ever met - some of which have been building Linux services since 0.01. Even though sometimes working at Facebook feels like drinking from the proverbial fire hose, I am grateful I have the opportunity to learn from some of the top people in their field. For example, in bootcamp I took a command-line efficiency class from Jim Meyering, one of the maintainers of coreutils and also a Facebook employee. Many other people have commented on this, but the perks and compensation are still top-notch. The company helps take care of your life so you can focus on work while you're working.
","Facebook hires the kind of people that expect a lot from themselves. Despite some reports, you do not need to work long hours in order to succeed at Facebook. Bootcamp gives you the chance to find a team that matches you well, and new hires should come in intending to join a team where they can both find balance and grow in their career. The company is growing and there is some sentiment around slowing down, but most engineering teams are still bottom-up driven and innovating in their space. The things we are doing around privacy and AR/VR are on the bleeding edge and we are strong leaders in these areas. On the other hand, ironically, there is also sentiment around moving too fast as a company. Since we are people- and product-focused (as opposed to engineering-focused, like at Google), our primary goal is to impact the lives of people for good. Sometimes this means we opt for rapid prototyping over beautifully designed code. However, we are doing much better at recognizing better engineering work such as cleaning up code and improving monitoring, especially in the PE role.

I have friends who love their job and role on the team they are in. This wasn't the case for me. Your company is as good as your manager and I had no good ones.
","1. Work/Life Balance If you don't make this boundary clear yourself and actively work on creating it - it will be exploited. Communication is broken in the company so you'll get messenger pings, quip notifications, emails, google doc updates at all hours. They even do long term project planning over chat groups in some teams. 2. Loads of unnecessary stress/anxiety related issues suffered by employees due to: (i) Managers fawning over each other showing ""impact"" of their teams - god help you if you don't make them look good or disagree with them. Anonymous reviews come through some of the time and people can say what they want about you. (ii) Unnecessary fighting between individual contributors due to performance review system. People ""strong arm"" you into doing work when it makes no business sense so it can make them look good. (iii) Bad reviews stick with you and you'll be treated differently - people are managed out/disappear/don't pass probation all the time. Speaking with friends in other companies FB isn't that attractive anymore and it's reputation is changing in the jobs marketplace. (iv) Performance reviews for the most part are opinion based (see 3 below) and not work based (v) Bullying/Level-ism. I've seen so much of it go on here and nothing done. (vi) Decisions a lot of the time are made from MPK and a lot of the time opinion based and not fact based which is scary. The 'Holier Than Though' engineering 'Move Fast' culture creates loads of chaos and is unnecessary. 3. You are goaled a lot on ""collaboration"" i.e. how much you are liked rather than the work you do or numbers you drive. This is a cult like characteristic where you have to be ""happy"" and ""always on."" I joined FB to work on projects to drive numbers but all my feedback was about how I got on with other people. Collaboration is important for most companies but it's fake at Facebook due to performance review system. 4. There are no formal processes for a lot of things in the company. The only analogy I have for Facebook is that it's like a big building, you go inside, peel back the wallpaper and all you will see is the pipes - the walls are missing. It's ""XFN this"" and ""XFN that"" so you reach out to teams to get things done and rely on ""collaboration"" rather than formal processes/business requirements. It's a huge surprise to me how it has gotten this far. I've seen parts of the operation down/backlogged for weeks on end due to bad planning but you can't complain about it because you won't be ""liked."" 5. GMS Summit - This event is a mix between Jonestown and being in North Korea. People stand up and applaud Zuckerberg when he comes on stage and don't sit down until he sits down. A VP (one in particular) gets on stage and tells the audience how lucky and special they are to have a job there and how grateful we should all be. Another one at the EMEA one told us to start sharing positive news about FB on our personal feeds.

Pros
The environment is very dynamic, open for new ideas, and the teams are very supportive. The future is promising. Management is very reachable and open to accept any critic. Open door policy. Managers are here to help you grow and the contribution is very rewarding. Freedom to decide the future growth and try different careers. Learning and development are very encouraged, too many internal resources, in addition to the external resources.
Cons
Information is placed over too many platforms, that creates a lot of confusion. The company is growing vastly, the strategy of acquiring the new talents needs to be re-evaluated, also the awareness of the differences between the same team members, further the cross-functional teams backgrounds and expectation needs to be highlighted to create a better harmony. Too many abbreviations for a new starter.

","(I worked in the Austin, Tx office under the Community Operations organization) Rampant hostile political atmosphere Team leadership and IC's will undermine and berate service team members to push their agendas forward. This is often overlooked by leaderhip and results in burnout and lack of empathy from everyone. This in turn produces subpar results and half-baked solutions. No one wins. Sloppy processes It's a benefit of a doubt to even say there are processes. Most of the internal processes are poorly documented and no one has or wants to give time to onboard new hires (see comment below on the culture driving self-absorbed motives). Getting anything done is 60% figuring out the best way forward, 20% fighting off the political backlash from making said decision and not the one the loudest stakeholder in the room wanted, and 20% is actually spent doing the work. So much waste. No concept of agile or the fundamentals of development practices in parts of Community Operations. No humanity in the human facing part of the org Working in Community Operations often felt like working in a call center. People often don't care about their work and they don't care to look beyond the ""what's in it for me"" philosophy running the show to see the people that the organization is supposed to help. We're talking about posts around some of the worst stuff out there- and the lack of empathy around it is nauseating and explains alot of the trouble Facebook has been getting into. Custom everything means sloppy everything So many of the internal tools are custom- even the ones that don't need to be! Often the tools are under supported (or supported by a staff that isn't willing to take feedback) so you end up with subpar tools supporting a massive company that is in desperate need of some tools that are built with intent and full functionality behind them. Culture breeds self-absorbed motives within people Facebook's culture is oriented around ""impact""- what impact did YOU have this performance evaluation period. It's not enough to say that you helped remove content that was harmful to minors (as an example unrelated to my direct experience). The impact needs to tie back to numbers- how many lines of code, how much money was saved, how many productive hours were saved-- not one of the questions asked is about how it helps the PEOPLE that use Facebook. It is all inward focused on the individual contributor- and as such the individual contributors act accordingly. There is not team oriented thought or conduct in my experience across Community Ops. There is only ""What's in it for me?"" HRBP are often ill informed on processes and policies and rotate like the second hand on a clock You never know what you're going to get with the HRBP group- some are warm and empathetic others are very clearly only there to protect the company (meaning they'll pigeon hole you into a defensive position). I didn't have a great experience with them and even in my exit process they got details wrong- like really important details. Kind of disappointing. Middle management is hijacking the company for personal gain and Upper Management hasn't caught on yet When I hear Mark talk- I see someone who really does believe in the mission behind the company- to make the world a more connected place. But I'm not sure that he or his team see the snakes in the grass that are not aligned to that mission and only looking for ways to achieve their personal gain. It's frightening given how much power and authority Facebook has and I really hope that this issue is sorted before things go to far.

Weekly Q&As with execs that are really open and casual, purposeful de-emphasis on titles. The emphasis is on ideas and impact; aspiring meritocracy - Fast pace! Some view this as a con, but if you are high-energy and easily bored like me, this is ideal. Plus, this includes fast career growth. If you can perform, you will be rewarded quickly. - Great people! ""Brilliant jerk"" behavior, as seen in these kinds of companies, is generally less tolerated/prevalent here than elsewhere - Generally best engineering pay among big-tech employers Less unique pros you've probably heard of (still awesome): - Top-class benefits (including INSANE parental benefits) - Amazing tech infrastructure, a great place to go very tech-deep - Campus is basically Disneyland
","- Recent newsmedia. It's easy to either feel discouraged or develop a bit of an ""us versus them"" mentality when the media/public seem both technically ill-informed and antagonistic towards your company. - It's an increasingly mature company, which means the pace is (slowly) slowing down. This affects the culture; fewer people are mission-driven or down for a passionate ""hacker"" culture.

","* The pressure to perform is insane; hitting my target + delivering on projects was just barely enough to get a meets all during the perf cycle * Roles are becoming increasingly small and marginalised as the team continues to scale. As a result, you see people jumping (literally) on to projects to set themselves apart from the rest of the team. It makes for a bit of a cut-throat culture just around the time when PSC hits * If you're interviewing at facebook, prepare for a ride with R4R - they'll probably won't speak to you again after you've signed the contract * While there are exceptions, the culture in the recruiting team is just weird. It sort of reminds me of high school. There's cliques, people gossip and there's for sure a couple of bullies: either people wouldn't even say a word to you or would go out of their way to make you feel like you're weird or different (to be honest, that also included my manager). * Ads Credits & being forced to dog-food beta apps: I'm a huge instagram fan and big user - so being forced to update my apps multiple times a day was a nightmare. * The perks are nice but salary/bonus are nothing to write home about: base is somewhat competitive but expect around 85-90% of the bonus you're promised in your offer letter.

","With fast promotion comes fast firing. It's up or out policy up to a certain level. Not a good place for senior engineers joining. Too much stress in the team driven by performance reviews, which is the most aggressive that I've ever known. Emphasis is on individual impact, due to which there's lot of distrust within the team. No stack ranking, but a curve is implemented a org level. This is not a big deal in other companies but here it means 'out'. Managers main job is to write performance reviews, and this often leads to micro management that can be extremely frustrating to senior engineers. There's lot of work duplication, most managers (even directors) ignore it as performance reviews is all about impact. Most engineers know that everyone wants to write code and make impact, so ignore the code duplication. Some teams are hiring just for the head count, not much impactful work. This becomes a problem for senior engineers as they have to invent work or get out. Before joining a team check out their roadmap for at least a year. This is a good place if you want make money at the cost of WLB. Not a place to be innovative, which inherently carries risk and takes time. It's a risk because if there's no impact you'll be fired. Most of the engineers work to satisfy performance reviews. My work is determined keeping performance review as the guideline. But company will be fine, lot of good engineers capable of quickly delivering a fix or hack a feature.

Facebook is for sure a great company, but my experience in BI was really bad. Please, see below the main cons of this team: 1)Management: Inexpert management, really superficial and high level approach, luck of clear direction, unprofessional jokes and attitude, play favourites, only interest in their own goals and not the development of the team - Lack of structure: No processes & structures, many teams have been created without a prior consultant opinion. So many people, me included, have been obliged to work in a team not fitting their skills. - Not all the opinions are heard: If you try to propose new projects ideas and . process you can result annoying. They ask people of higher level to be independent and drive their own initiatives, but at the end the managers decide and promote only the people that help them to reach their own goals. - Team collaboration: we are all great talent and characters, but the lack of job together with the managers inconsistency created un-healthy competition and back stubbing environment

2019-09-13, EMEA Recruitment Director,"Dublin, Dublin","Current Employee, less than 1 year","Wow! Loving the humility, empathy and inspiration!","I've only just started with Facebook, but I'm truly humbled to be part of the team! For me it starts first and foremost with the mission: to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. I love this mission and while I've worked in other great companies in the past with great missions too - this by far - is the mission that relates most to me as an individual. It's powerful. It's empowering. It's enriching. It's transformative. Not just for me but for so many people we share the world with today but also tomorrow. What I love about it is I believe Facebook and its family of apps: Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, etc, and other technologies like it from other companies are transforming the medium of language, the medium of communication. I can remember being a young boy in the early 80's in a small city called Waterford, in the south of Ireland, being excited when introduced to the humble CD for the first time. I remember clearly the first mobile brick hand-phones, mpeg players, ipods, on and on and on. With the advent of AR/VR and the proliferation global messaging apps that connect huge parts of the world today I'm feeling a similar excitement here seeing first hand the impact these technologes are having for billions of people on the planet. I'm really enjoying being in a company not just playing a huge part in this evolutionary transformation but doing so in a company from what I can see so far is doing so with real respect for its employees. The work environment is safe, collaborative and fair. There are large degrees of flexibility, autonomy and transparency. Folks are humble and authentic, at least the ones I've all met so far, and they deeply care about their work and those people around them. I'm only new, so I'll need more to understand the company as the weeks, months and years go by, but so far so good and I'm delighted to be joining at such an early stage of its growth.
","None yet. Not hear long enough!

2019-09-12, Senior Software Engineer,"Menlo Park, CA","Current Employee, less than 1 year",Great company to work at - do not believe to different news,"I work in company for 6 months, but I like how company works and operates. One of policies is an openness - this includes famous weekly Q&As. Senior management tries to explain the background behind decisions, so you know why one or another thing had to be done. In general everything focuses on making product which would be better for customers. There were a number of mistakes makes with privacy perspective, but there is a trend to improve this. This is very good approach - instead of hiding mistakes, company focuses on fixing them. After getting an offer I was not sure to join the company because of its reputation, but being inside I figured out most of this is an exaggerations to make a hype in news. Work style is very flexible - you want to deliver new things, to make an impact, but from another perspective, it is not demanding and it is far from sweat factory in some other companies. It left time to learn something, you can attend many meeting remotely. Work life balance is very good - it is difficult to improve it without affecting the work (someone should do the work, right?). There are a lot of young people around (ex-students, but usually with great knowledge), but also there are still a number of experienced people - so aging doesn't seems to be a problem at FB.
","Work style is open space. Many new buildings are awesome, while a number of old buildings are depressing - dimmed lighting, gray ceilings. Some buildings have a quiet policy, but for others it is not so good. I'd recommend remodel old buildings (hack, paint ceiling to a white, so it will reflect the light, install better lighting, work with designers!), split large rooms into smaller, team-sized rooms, add more VC rooms so people could easier get on conference call without disturbing others. Another minus is hyper-concentrated campus in Menlo Park. It is difficult to find a good, reasonable-priced rent in that area. It works well for young people, but for families with kids there are a lot of other factors to be taken into account, so Menlo Park area just doesn't work.

I feel that even within my defined role, I have the opportunity to develop my ideas and not just receive instructions from above. When you work on Facebook you are perceived differently, which means that Facebook is a huge company and that it is often chosen among the best places to work, which is true. So I proudly say that I work on Facebook, sometimes even slightly condescending. For those of you who are thinking of coming to work here it is important to know that the screening process is not easy and all this goodness comes to the people that Facebook chooses very carefully.
","Sometimes people think that what we're doing on Facebook is sitting around all day thinking about ideas and playing.

Sometimes there are projects that require us to work many hours and work after hours.

","The appeal quickly wears off. Your experience at Facebook highly depends on the team you join. Facebook does not have the best people managers. If you join a team with a good manager who knows the system, you will be more likely to have a productive, prosperous time at Facebook. If you join a team with a bad manager, your work-life balance will be horrible. You will feel extreme pressure with the Performance cycle review every six months. Worse yet, you may even blame yourself for what's happening, not realizing the role your manager plays until it is too late. Facebook is a good company for new college graduates. Even with a bad experience, you can learn so much about practical, applied technology here. For those with several years of experience, or with family commitments, be careful. Come into Facebook with a clear sense of what you need from Facebook that you cannot get anywhere else. Be prepared to leave when that is delayed, or not a possibility, or comes at a cost to your family or external commitments. For most people, Facebook is not a company that you join and happily work at for the rest of your life. Facebook is a temporary stop that will squeeze as much productivity out of you as it can. When that stops, it forces you out or makes you want to leave.

2019-08-15, Systems Engineer,"London, England, England","Current Employee, less than 1 year","Awesome perks, awful engineering","Free food, first class flights to the US, free gadgets and lots and lots of swag. Very complex and difficult problems to solve (mainly self inflicted due to the lack of good endineering practices).
","My experience is in the enterprise engineering org. * Very individualistic mindset, team is only the logo on the swag you get. * Several years of unattended spaghetti engineering that nobody dares to handle, but someone has to maintain (and get burnt doing so). * Awful oncalls due to the horrible engineering practices and mountains of tech debt. * Blame showers during incident reviews (and incident triaging). * Over the fence handovers. Fake promises by recruiters, lack of leadership. * Walls between orgs for transfers and artificial, per-org devopment limitations. It's better to leave and reinterview with a chance of getting better offer than trying to move internally (and still going through the interviews) and getting your level frozen for a year. There's some efforts to improve engineering practices, but get smudged and diluted by the lack of will and understanding from the leadership, and the lack of reward from the global org (doing two really crappy things gives you more performance review points than doing something with high quality, and/or refactoring any amount of the crappy things around).

","Organizationally has become very political; Feels like Big Brother Is always watching & Judging; As a large org now moves much slower, very hard to get something done or change something; People burning out after 1-2 years (not a good sign); lots of complaints about career opportunities from within, seems they prefer to hire from outside versus promote from within. Essentially putting FB on your resume will get you career advancement somewhere else but it's super hard to move up from within. You will also find yourself working so much more than ever expected. They preach a lot about ""work like balance,"" but only about 1% of the company has figured out how to do that. You get judged for making decisions that put personal life over work. The overall company culture is top-notch though, they invest in and preach the right things, it's just day to day management has competing priorities.

The revenue performance of the company says it all, they are rich and generous with employees. You're really spoiled here. Unique opportunities with an ability to learn on a daily basis, really building up your resume with an ability to fill any gap with new experiences. People are quite protective of their work and don't like others stepping on their toes, as normal, but there is so much to do that you can create your own role and work on the matters that are of highest interest to you.
","No decision making. This sounds incredible, but it's true. Decisions are taken as part of cross-functional meetings where everyone has an opinion and nobody is really driving. Somehow, it seems to work well because decisions ARE taken! But the downside is that it creates a lot of insecurity as people are really freaked out that things blow up (and it blows up quickly here, considering the regular negative media headlines) and that they be blamed. Managers in particular, are very sensitive, insecure and as a result, they tend to micro-manage or get involved in matters they shouldn't be involved with at their level. A lot of dissatisfaction about management all around. A lot of pressure to get the job done. You need to be resilient and work hard on preserving your work/life balance. Company culture is poor - extremely political and everyone is focused on building their career. We all know that having Facebook on our resume will open fantastic doors! It's ok to navigate the politics and survive though..you just need to be aware of it and of the fact that your colleagues will not hesitate to throw you under the bus if they feel threatened!

2019-08-05, Manager,,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",External PR fires are just a manifestation of corporate culture,"no work stress at all, look at how many new products facebook released over the last 5 years
","User Empathy: it is shocking that many orgs dont have any metrics to how much they impact users and what is more shocking is that they dont want to. users come as a secondary class citizen in facebook not a primary asset. i struggled to drive from user side. big thinking: the company really discourages big thinking, they even write this in performance reviews. innovation is handicapped by the culture values. opportunities and risks: it is very easy to predict next steps within facebook whether it is an opportunity or a risk but senior leadership for some reason dont act on 90+% prediction accuracy. leaders should prevent risks from turning into massive issues and pursue obvious opportunities, but facebook wait till last minute and activate fire fighting, also too many missed opportunities. Fire Fighting: we are constantly in a reactive mode of firefighting, it blinds us from seeing what needs to be done. Planning: facebook is super allergic to ""planning"" as it is perceived to be a top down approach. we see multiple solutions to the same problem withing the same team as a symptom. Slow Culture: within facebook every individual is super fast as there is freedom to what you want/can do, but it slows the entire machine pretty dramatically as there is no direction and we end up correcting course every month. Decision Making: there is no process or methods on how to move the needle, it is all based on one's social likability. HR culture: HR is part of so many aspects in facebook more than any other american corporate. they created this toxic environment to be a single point of failure in most decision. Bottom up approach: make people really dizzy as there is a lack of direction. unless you are an engineer, you will suffer badly. I am really super surprised that PR fires are not 10 more folds of what we have today.

Very big and cool issues to work on, which you wouldn't fine any where else in the world due to the sheer scale of the company.
","The internal career system seems well intended and fair at first, until you try to follow it. Very poor work-life balance. I've never worked so much in my entire career, yet it never seems enough to satisfy the criteria to grow up internally. All internal systems are custom made and many times they compare poorly to open-source alternatives, specially from usability and stability perspective. Which means you will spend a long time to master the internal tooling and all that hard-earned knowledge will be worthless when you leave the company. Also, that all engineers have so much freedom means that everyone is constantly reinventing the wheel, and increasing the overall complexity of the environment thus changes harder and harder as time goes by. This is exacerbated by the bonus system, which for many years has encouraged engineers to build and deliver new things rather than fixing existing issues. All of this combined has lead to a monstrous internal ecosystem which is a huge pile of entangled hair, where the simplest of tasks requires careful planning and understanding and will take several days. Management has lately changed the incentives to encourage fixing and better quality, but it's too little too late.

","* Your job satisfaction (and your salary) can change greatly depending on where you are in the company. My technical title was substituted with a non-technical ""specialist"" equivalent that paid less, resulting in a 20% bump in my salary when left, despite downgrading from a ""lead"" level position at Facebook to a ""senior"" level position at my current job. * Management is often promoted based on seniority rather than competence. * ""Most fast"" mentality leads to duplicated work, lack of documentation, and general confusion. Senior ICs are expected to spend much of their time project managing to make up for the failure in organization. I often found during requirements gathering for a project that part or all of it had already been done elsewhere and everyone had simply forgotten about it. * The culture of open communication makes it seem like employee feedback is valued and encouraged, but actions are rarely taken on that feedback. The above issues weren't as bad when I first joined, but my last year there was a nightmare filled with so much toxic stress and bad politics that I regularly broke down crying when I got home from work. On the other hand, I have friends elsewhere at Facebook who do the same job and love every minute of it. It all comes down who your managers and directors are.

","If you are a data scientist, you need to really care about two things: - Impact. Unlike SWE, who can prove their impacts by finishing pre-planned coding projects and rolling out pre-planned features, data scientist does not automatically get credit if you only finish beautiful analyses. You have to suggest eng team to apply your suggestion from analysis, and prove how much of the product growth are from your analysis. So sometimes your impact can be subjective. - Skillset. You may be asked to do a lot of ad-hoc analyses from eng team, which I am sure are very important and can guide engineers whether to implement certain features, but that will prevent you from doing some deep dive analyses and learning some new techniques in data analysis. Maybe after a year or two, you will find that you did not build any statistical models or haven't touched any machine learning. But that's the skillset what other companies will ask for when you apply new job. Who cares you did how many ad-hoc analyses or AB test or wrote how many data pipelines. It's the fancy machine learning model that will earn you respect. Also, total pay is lower than SWE for the same level.

It's really a dice roll unless you're privileged enough to select a specific team. - Facebook itself is a well greased machine. It self-enforces a lot of its own problems we're seeing the outcomes of today due to how it works. It's unlikely to change that anytime soon, so if you don't like how FB is unable to predict externalities in its work at its scale, you'll be upset working there - Working at FB is a bit like having blinders on. You're so dang busy and shipping things all the time, it is not conducive for you to think about the big picture and (related to above) the potential butterfly effects/externalities of your work. Many well-intentioned projects end up having disasterous consequences, but I'm confident that 99% of people out there, if they worked on the project, would've also been unable to predict the fallout. The prime example here is Instant Articles, which was a design-lead initiative to give select news partners the ability to make their articles load fast and render ""natively"" in the mobile apps (spun out of Paper after that got shut down). I can assure you that all the team wanted to make was a beautiful interface — it was lead by a product designer — and none of them would've wished to kill ad revenue/contribute to ruining journalism. You can argue that Instant Articles was one in many many steps FB took that ultimately shifted the ability to make money off of news ads from newspapers to FB itself, and lead to today's massive journalism layoffs and click-bait culture (if ya can't get clicks, ya can't get ad views, and ya can't make money). If you ever met the Instant Articles design lead, you'd know all they care about is a good design and polished interactions. But it turns out, just caring about that means you aren't thinking about the potential damage your product can do 4 years down the line.

It sets you up for success in a variety of places.
","- While compensation is rewarded, leveling up and moving into new roles is very very challenging - Can feel like Facebook values outside hires more than inside talent already there - Many people do not get hired for roles in different departments or functions simply because they didn't do well on an interview, when they are more than qualified based on previous work experience at the company -- which isn't taken into account for hiring decisions. They weight internal/external folks the same. - work life balance is not great, but you don't come to facebook to ""Cruise"" if you do, you will be fired quickly - Newer PMs from other companies seem to be infiltrating a ""CEO"" role in their job -- which is not how Facebook operates. Collaboration > dictatorship of features and product. - The product specialist role specifically is challenging to stay in for longer than a few years -- the bar for performance gets higher, but you have the same ""quiver"" of tactics and tools and can only reinvent the wheel so much. - Many teams don't understand your role or respect it much, which is problematic because a lot of your impact comes from your ability to push changes and improvements through EMs, PMs and other product focused teams.

2019-02-05,Anonymous,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee,"Unless you're a software engineer, DO NOT join FB","60% of the people are nice and civil, but the same could be said just about anywhere you go. These are usually employees with less than a 2 year tenure. The rest of the 40% are classified as the FB veterans, who believe they deserve certain privileges (like mistreating and bullying new employees). The culture is to blame as FB values tenure over experience. An IC with 2 years of FB experience and 0 years of life experience is perceived to be more valuable than a FB noob with 15 years of industry experience. It's akin to that one possessive and insecure person in a group of friends who gets down right hostile when a new friend enters the circle. I'm the only noob on my team so you can imagine my plight. The team is very hostile towards me and I absolutely dread coming to work every day. My manager encourages and actively participates in this kind of high school-esque nonsense. I made a huge mistake coming to FB and I can't wait to leave. You have been warned-do not join unless you're a glutton for punishment.
","See above-yes, you guessed right, there are no pros! The performance review process is every bit as bad as Zuck's psychopathic stare. The only way you will get a satisfactory rating is if you're good friends with your direct manager and your peers. It forces you to form insincere and bogus relationships with people.

","- Because there is an opportunity to stay IC, sometimes peers become leads out of default/lack of supply. This leads to subpar management across several teams - I have also seen management hired in externally who have no idea how to be a manager. Are recruiters not checking their candidates' backgrounds? These charlatans will slowly deteriorate what was once an amazing culture - Politics have started to mitigate internal mobility, growth, and development opportunities. This also seeps into the 2x/year performance cycle - I have unfortunately seen FB throw some tenured employees away like trash.

","I have been working at Facebook for some years now and I see the company getting worse and worse every month. For a company, whose mission is to build community, Facebook does the exact opposite to its employees. You feel like you live in a cult, where every sign of disagreement or critical feedback is punished from management. There is zero tolerance for an employee who expresses concern over a reorg which has been decided overnight, or over a change of job description/duties. Management encourages you to fake happiness, and to pretend everything is working perfectly. Important communications happen on workplace and not in person, you know for fear of not giving the perfect fake answer... and you just need to smile and keep working. There is no structure whatsoever! Everyone does whatever they wish to do, and when it comes to performance evaluation, you simply fake that too. Employees are in competition with each other, stealing projects and taking credits for work they did not do, and if you dare to share constructive feedback about a colleague then you should be prepared to seeing HR shortly. There is no long term strategy at this company, the product team keeps shipping products for the sake of shipping products without stopping and reflecting at the impact this is going to have on advertisers, and if something goes wrong it does not matter... after all it is better to move fast than doing the right things.. If Facebook wants to survive its biggest crisis, it needs seriously solid structure to grow, and should work on fixing all the mess made up until now. I am so disappointed by this company, instead of thinking of making more money, think of how you can really improve the product and create a positive work environment.

Pros
The moment one steps inside Facebook, they immediately know something is different here. There is a positive energy within the offices and all the employees walking about them. This was the feeling I had six months ago when I joined Facebook, and still reflects my feelings today. These people practice what they preach...they are delivering platforms and tools to build community and bring the world closer together, period.
Cons

But don’t get it twisted! All the free food, snacks, drinks etc. are made to keep you at work longer :)
","Looking back at my experience there, I can clearly see that I was unfortunate to end up in a team that I was in. The fact that no one internally wanted to move to that team should have alarmed me, but having just moved to FB I didn’t think of leaving that early. Internally, people were very open about how they would rather quit than join our team. I figured that’s the reason why they hired a complete new team, instead of just moving some people around. However, people at FB are generally blinded by the perks and the status of the company. They make themselves believe that they are happy, but in reality everyone is constantly anxious. They just learn to cope and make it feel normal. The pressure is HIGH and the workload tremendous. Because of the amount of silly meetings that you can’t say no to, you will end up spending more than 50 hours per week to make sure you are up to speed. Some people at FB told me that work consumed every second of their life (they just couldn’t switch off). I knew of other colleages that they come in on a Saturday to do some extra work, and some dedicate their Sunday evening on projects to add to their internal CV. You can’t really switch off, at least not before 9PM. So, if you’re in a relationship/have kids, don’t go there. As a single person I felt bad for my colleagues with a family. In my situation, and I also speak for the rest of the team, there was no support, no proper internal onboarding and literally no one around to be able to inform you what the general expectations were. It’s all very performance driven, so you have to Build up that amount of work you do, cause everything gets tracked. They don’t care how you do it, just do it. This explains why people work throughout the weekend to make sure they hit a certain amount of finished tasks for that week before the new week starts. You will be compared to Peers on your level, so it’s important to make sure you hit at least average to receive some bonus after your review. We had a new manager starting a few months after us, and hierarchy was the management style. Having anything to say went against the manager’s principles and clearly we weren’t liked. So were other colleagues of other teams not liked by this manager, because of their opinions. Be mindful of what you say...not everything is appreciated. At FB, managers are more valued than IC’s and they rather keep a bad manager than a good IC. So please be careful and try to make your manager your friend, trust me it will help you. They have amazing trainings on how to manage bias, but in all honesty, everyone was biased. The way they hired people, they way they treated people and the way they rated each other. During the annual performance cycle, you would only ask feedback from the people you had a good relationship with to help you get your bonus. Up until now, FB was the least favorable experience for me. I only say ‘worst experience’ when I talk to friends. They saw the negative impact it had on me working in a toxic environment. I do want to say that 2% genuinely loves working there, unfortunately the majority doesn’t.

Speaking with a number of employees who left Facebook only to return once again, while no company is perfect, there is a lot that Facebook has to offer - not just in terms of benefits, but with the impact that our apps and services have on this world - for people and businesses alike. Our open culture is pretty amazing to understand the vision of our company and where we're heading. Leadership has been consistently transparent in ways that many other companies are not - even other tech companies - with weekly Q&As, open posts, and quarterly all hands. And they address tough issues or topics head on. There are a lot of career opportunities within the company - as we often refer to the ""jungle gym"" that you can take your career internally. There are incredibly passionate people who work at Facebook, and I never cease to be amazed by the level of intelligence and care demonstrated by my coworkers around the world to help our company deliver on our mission.
","Particularly as of late, Facebook has been subject to a lot of negative press. While some of it may be deserved, a lot of it feels sensationalist. So employees have to develop a thick skin and resilience to a lot of this scrutiny and ensure that we are focused on the long-term, not just the short-term. But perhaps the primary area of improvement is that people are driven and work hard - which sometimes comes at the expense of the work/life balance that we all try to achieve.

Business Outlook
Pros
Facebook is a great employer. I appreciate it especially when I compare myself to my peers in other companies. We get paid very competitively and the perks are amazing. The job itself is rather interesting as well. I love the very caring and chilled atmosphere in the office - coming from consulting, no overtime and no extreme pressure is really a big difference. Most of the people in the office are quite smart and really fun to work with. I also love how international the Dublin office is, before joining I didn't see it as something very important but now I understand why everyone from FB keeps mentioning that.
Cons
- The constant talk about growth. Facebook is not growing as fast as it used to, yet the company hires like crazy. To be honest I think this is too much at this point. All these people are doing ""projects"" but these projects are in 3/4 not useful at all. The sole purpose of them is that someone can write it in their performance review but no one really uses the outcome of the project after that. - Despite the management saying how international the company is, every decision is still taken by Americans/British/Irish and according to their worldview. Which sometimes has awful effects on the company image in countries that were not part of the Commonwealth or are the US. It's particularly visible when there is a PR fire in American or British media, they can change something overnight based on that not thinking about how it will impact other parts of the world. Also it's worth mentioning that a huge majority of managers is Irish/British, and there is little internal mobility for non-natives. - Performance review is somehow not fair. Technically there are career expectations but if you fulfil all of them, you'll get the lowest score. There are people from certain parts of the world that would be working 16h a day (I'm thinking East Asia in particular) to get the best score so then people from other parts of the world need to work longer as well, otherwise their achievements will look pale compared to those working overtime. And performance assessment, potential promotion and bonus, are based on your place on the curve rather than on whether you fulfilled criteria of your job. - Internal mobility rules are very unfair. As an external applicant you'd meet and even exceed all the criteria for a particular role but if you are internal you cannot move to a role that is higher grade than yours. This leads to a situations in which people who applied internally were rejected, left the company and were soon approached by recruiters for the very role on LinkedIn if they'd be interested.

2018-11-19, Data Engineer,"Seattle, WA","Current Employee, less than 1 year",Some adventures are not worth taking,"free food, free t-shirts, free laundry, good pay. If you're right out of college, this might be the place for you, but that's mostly because you wont have much work experience to compare it against.
","1) the job I got is not the job I thought I was getting: As an engineer, with engineer in the title, and over 10 years of experience, I really thought I would get to do more engineering. Unfortunately, the job is really about 50% business analyst and 20% project management, and 30% engineering. You are expected to own every aspect of your project, regardless if anyone else actually does. Also, you're told you have the opportunity to choose the team you want to be on, but for me, that choice was removed at the last minute. 2) bad management, bad leadership - all managers are expected to be individual contributors which is basically another way of saying that they aren't particularly good at either, and do not have time to devote to both roles. Also, be prepared for mansplaining. 3) more money than sense: gobs and gobs of money are being thrown around. there's basically an offsite every other week. Nevermind about work, deadlines, or being competent, it's more important to go glassblowing. The pay is nice, in fact, its the best feature about the place. 4) the company that wants to connect the world would rather loose talent than have remote workers. no, seriously. say you're on a team, and your team decides to move to another office thats like 1 hour away. you are kicked off the team and put on another team. what sense does that make? new mom wants to wfh? not allowed. Seriously, it's called skype, people. 5) and speaking of teams, the team structure is completely whack. instead of having a core group of people I work with on many projects, I have a different group of people I work with on each project. a completely different set of swe, pm, ds, and de for each project. This completely limits our ability to grow more efficient with each project, let alone build any sort of a professional relationship. 6) you're not allowed to fix things that are legit broken. I've only been here a short time and have already had to suffer fools who prefer poorly designed metrics with political bs to actually measuring things properly. bug 1 told not to fix it - too big to fail, bug 2, never got fixed by other team, bug 3, too high profile to fix. seriously? why not just admit all your metrics are wrong? 7) people care more about performance reviews than actual performance. no really, if I hear the phrase make ""an impact"" I will vom. What this really means is not ""do good and useful work"" which is how it might be interpreted, instead it means that you should very little on the very high profile projects, and then post it everywhere, to make sure people NOTICE. Also, keep a log of your work so that you can share it with your absentee manager come review time - otherwise, he (yeah I said he) likely will have no idea what you worked on or why. But, instead of this being a meaningful signal, it just becomes more noise.

2018-11-02,Anonymous,"Menlo Park, CA","Former Employee, more than 1 year",Not a good place for seasoned professionals,"- benefits and perks - endless food options - global reach and impact At Facebook, you have the opportunity to work on products that everyone uses. This helps you use and sharpen your skills in an entirely new way, and really think through your logic and decisions—unpacking every detail because you have to make sure it works and is understood across all demographics, countries, cultures, and languages. They also take care of employees. Everything is free: shuttle rides, laundry service, professional development courses, tons of swag, and all the food, snacks, and drinks you can eat (the “Facebook 15” is real). The company’s health benefits are unmatched and they even have medical, dental, and gym facilities on campus.
","- politics and back channeling - competitiveness and lack of collaboration - relationships hold more value than quality work Facebook the company is like the platform: everyone acts like everything is great, but no one acknowledges or exposes what’s really going on under the surface. People act like it’s all sunshine and roses, but because there’s such a “focus on impact” and performance, it’s actually a competitive environment where people are out for themselves and scrambling for whatever projects will give them the most visibility—at Facebook, visibility > impact > high performance ratings > bonus multipliers + equity refreshers. As a result, people you know and being an influencer matter more than the quality of your work. Likes are the real currency and even though you’re told to “be your authentic self”, one type of person benefits most: those who are extroverted, don’t rock the boat, and are oftentimes male. While the actual benefits and perks are great, don’t be fooled by the glamour of it all: they’re also designed to keep you there and keep you working. You’ll be taken care of, but the focus on impact and performance makes it’s easy to forget to take care of yourself. There’s an undercurrent of anxiety in the culture that is very real and not often acknowledged. Facebook is a great company for those just starting out their career. If you’re a seasoned professional, I suggest staying away. It doesn’t matter how much experience or expertise you have—I spent most of my time proving to people half my age that I knew what I was doing. Time and again, my suggestions would be ignored or edited to the point that they were no longer my ideas. Time and again, leadership would be shown those watered down ideas and say, “Nope!” Time and again, when I’d go back to my original recommendation, leadership would say, “That’s the one!” After awhile, it was finally time for me to say, “I’m tired of (and better than) this.”

2018-09-18, Client Partner,"Toronto, ON","Current Employee, more than 1 year",Client Partner - Financial Services Better than I could have possibly imagined.,"Instead of completing a formal review, I’ll share a post I made to celebrate my 1 year anniversary since joining Facebook. —- Today marks my first year at Facebook. We call it a Faceversary. And, while celebrating your work anniversary might seem a bit frivolous (or at least I thought so early on), I quickly learned to appreciate the FB tradition that’s built around these Faceversaries. It’s valuable to reflect on all that happens in a year at work, considering how much energy, time, and effort we put into it. When you make it to your 10-year milestone (my count down starts now), you get the opportunity to join Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, and others on the management team to tell a 10-year Faceversary story to the entire company. Those are always funny or emotional, or both. So, what can I share after my first year here? TL;DR: Work with and learn from the very best people. Drinking from the firehose and learning a ton. Autonomy, authority and support. World-class benefits. Open culture to the bones. An inside look at how serious everyone is about minimizing the bad and building more of the good. Five core values in action. Pretty darn happy. I get the pleasure to work with incredible, impressive, and talented people daily. Both within the walls of Facebook, but also with clients and partners who are working on some unbelievable things. My pod and my core team are just legendary. This isn’t lip service. I really get to work with and learn from the very best. I’ve learnt SO MUCH. About digital advertising and marketing. About financial services. About media. About other industry verticals I previously knew nothing about. About navigating complex circumstances. About working for a company that’s constantly in the spotlight. About digging deeper to really understand. About cross-functional collaboration. About partnerships. About technology. And much more. Internally, they say every day at Facebook is equivalent to a week. I now know why. I have the autonomy, authority, and support I need to be successful and run my marketing consulting business the way I see fit. Further, I get to shape and influence how businesses engage, nurture, and build new relationships with people. I have access to incredible benefits that I’m astonished by daily and so grateful for. In fact, I’m writing this post while on paid paternity leave to spend time with my family and our new addition, Logan. Facebook fosters an open culture that is like nothing I’ve ever seen before. Mark hosts a weekly company-wide Q&A where he addresses thoughtful and difficult questions about a wide-range of issues and opportunities. Everyone, from Interns to tenured employees, are welcome to ask anything and they don’t face judgement or criticism for raising difficult topics. On our internal Workplace (Facebook for Work), I can join and learn about a whole host of interesting projects, regardless of whether I’m involved in them. I’ve learnt a lot about both the harmful ways and the incredibly positive ways Facebook can be used. I get a firsthand look at how serious everyone is about minimizing the bad and building more of the good. There are 5 core values that guide how we work at Facebook. And I see them in practice regularly. Build social value. Move fast. Be bold. Be open. Focus on impact. I’ve always been fortunate in my career. I’ve worked on amazing teams, on fascinating projects, with inspiring mentors and leaders. Facebook has been a continuation of that for me. But, I must say, I’ve never been this happy. So, here’s to one amazing year and the many more to follow!
","The bar has been set so high for any future employer to be within my consideration set. I’m truly spoiled.

Office spaces are nice, the benefits are really good, plus they continuously update their 'Life@' perks which can be handy and convenient.
","The worst part about Facebook is the culture. With the excuse that you should 'focus on impact', people will fight for 'sexy' projects and things that will obtain them a good performance review. Since middle and upper management often do not have a clue about what their own teams actually do, whatever you can make sound important (e.g. with fake metrics or tales of potential impact), you are onto a winner. Unfortunately, the same managers do not enforce a culture of fairness or trust; instead, it is a culture of rewarding back-stabbers and people who 'get the work done' but who, at the same time, treat their colleagues poorly. By that, I mean stealing projects or not giving credit to those who get the work done, for example. It is an awful environment to work in. Some teams are worse than others as well: You could end up reporting into a bad apple who steals projects from you. It happens, and it happens often. Good people managers are never rewarded, as people management is not something Facebook recognises as important. Yes, in the orientation they will give you a big speech about it but when was the last time good people managers got promotions? Managers should focus on people, and ICs should focus on things. Unfortunately, bad managers who are good at IC work get rewarded often to the detriment of their teams, who have to suffer under people who should have never become people managers. The so-called Pulse survey is a joke, as no importance is given to low-scoring managers. If 10 people in a team say they would not work with their manager again, something must be wrong, don't you think? To any potential employees: Do not get fooled by the appearances. Facebook makes people feel trapped because they make you think this is the 'best' company and that you should be grateful you are part of Mark Zuckerberg's dream of making the world more 'open and connected'. It's a fallacy. Do not fall for it.

This creates insensitives for people to produce low quality code, and under-maintaining it, since you are better off solving 90% of the problem and say you're done without covering edge cases. This also pressures people to work alone on highly measureable projects and not share the credit for larger projects. in the year and a half I've been with the company, I've seen 4 people fired in a 30~ person team, plus two more quit ahead of being fired.

","Despite what they say at the onboarding, or the all hands, or the company wide emails, upper management is not interested in hearing opposing views. Once you're branded as not being supportive of the collective group thought, your career path will be stunted. Tenure and support for the upper management team is weighted more heavily than individual skills.

Even after getting ""Exceeds Expectations"" cycle after cycle, I found it difficult to influence the top-down decisions.

We have, workplace, FB’s own internal app. It’s like Facebook within Facebook for employees. I can message anybody and be in contact with anybody in the company. I’m an entry level engineer and talk to VPs Directors and even Mark, who holds open forum EVERY Friday in person. That level of access is phenomenal. If you have an idea you can do it. You have the support and finances to achieve whatever you can think of. If you’ve worked anywhere else then you can see why everything I’ve written is so important. It just isn’t like that anywhere else.
","It’s so good that it would be hard to work anywhere else. I’m destroyed for life. If it’s your first job I would feel bad because this is NOT a true view of the working world.

This helps getting good reviews for hard work, even when you're young and unexperienced. - You get many opportunities to work cross-functionally, which is great for diversity of thought. Personally, I like the fact I am exposed to working with technical and non-technical people. - Some of the benefits are amazing. Fertility treatment coverage and in general medical coverage are the best out there.
","- Facebook purposefully hires very smart and ambitious individuals. Even when there's no pressure from the manager to work long hours, you often see people working long hours, which in return puts more pressure on you. - There are no incentives to stay in the company for longer than 4 years. Once you vest all your RSUs, refreshers you get for good performance look very unattractive. It's more and more common for people to leave FB after 4 years, and come back a year later to re-negotiate their RSUs. - You are being ""punished"" with certain benefits if both spouses work for Facebook. A good example is baby cash which you get per family, not per employee. - Commute in the Bay area is terrible. - It's getting very very crowded in MPK. Facilities are definitely not keeping up with recruiting.

There are many professional development opportunities to allow you keep growing. The perks could be a pro like free food, laundry, salon, etc. but I personally found it to feel like the company wants to keep you there instead of going home and having social interactions with people outside of Facebook. But, if you don' t have a strong social support network, it's a great set up. My co-workers were by far the best part of the company!
","The hiring process is very strange as they hire people without knowing what team they'll be on, allowing for an opportunity to be placed on a team that's not a great fit, and then being stuck in it and not being able to move around until at least a year in. HR seems most concerned about protecting the company rather than really listening to employees and their concerns. There is a lot of turnover lately...I had 4 managers in about a 9 month span, which leads to really confusing situations. They also keep bad managers in their positions, even if there have been multiple concerns raised about them from a whole team. The values the company promotes are great in theory, but I don't see them in practice.

Excellent mobility, you can work on anything and any technology that catches your eye. Brilliant co-workers. Great variety of classes to learn new cutting edge tech.
","If you're junior to midlevel (IC4 and below) it's an amazing and supportive environment. IC5 and above and you're thrust into backstabbing and politics. Basically, if you don't invent something amazing you're going to be managed out thru repeated crappy reviews dinging you for abstract nouns with no real actionable feedback. That goes double if you're over 40. While the directors whip out stories of people who brought FaceBook.com down and are still working there, I think if your employee number has more than four digits you only get one mistake.

FB is used internally and truly feels like a community - something I haven never experienced at any other company before. It's a place to explore your passions with classes in the arts, a music room, running clubs, health center, etc. Everything is at your fingertips.
","The recruiting team here is over 1000+ people and going up. Like someone else mentioned, the quality of hires for the recruiting team is worsening. The R4R team is so desperate to hit their goal that the bar is low and it shows. There are many new inexperienced recruiters that we just wish would or COULD do their basic, functional job. The role of a sourcer and recruiter is becoming smaller and smaller. And although leadership insists they care, every action they take suggests they do not. It is hard to constantly be reminded that you are merely just another number to be replaced asap. Be prepared to work long, long hours. There isn't such a thing as ""work/life"" balance as most in recruiting will work into the night and weekends. The goals and expectations are extremely high so you're constantly competing with a whole org of overachievers. Realistically, this means it'll be tough to even achieve a ""Meets All"" rating during the review cycle as everyone is overachieving, thereby changing that already high goal.

","Incorrect understanding and execution of the company values: Value: Done is better than perfect - the incorrect interpretation is that done and perfect are mutually exclusive, no-one wants to do anything that is perfect. Value: We [managers / leaders] are non-directive - incorrect interpretation is that managers do not need to provide direction, the result is that manager are ineffective and simply try to please employees. Value: Make an impact - incorrect interpretation is any impact is a good impact, the actual impact of this is that there is little significant impact. The company has many conflicting ways of working, for example the short term review process and the want and need to take risks and innovate. The result is that employees do not want to take long term risks as they will be penalised in their next review. There is a PIP (personal improvement plan) process to help those underachieving to get back on track. This is only effective at removing people from the company and during new manager training (FME) managers are informed that most people (>80%) that are placed on a PIP leave the company. At the same time the company prides itself on the ability of employees to have tough conversations (Crucial Conversations is a class employees are encouraged to attend) yet no-one has these tough conversations. There is a reliance on processes such as the PIP process to remove people from the company rather than having direct conversations.

","The tl;dr is Facebook is a big company and its cons reflect that. The company mission and values are incredibly admirable, but have become increasingly difficult to implement as the company has grown. * You might find yourself working on a project with over a million lines of code, but nobody on your team has written more than 10,000. The need to sit down and figure it out yourself can be pretty stressful in an environment that is pushing you to ""make an impact"" and be constantly shipping new features. * The few senior engineers (in my org at least) show little interest in mentoring more junior engineers. * Sink or swim mentality among engineers, the mega-teams supporting products in the core app can be brutal and unwelcoming. * Launch decisions are very political - criteria for launching a change is opaque, and feedback from department leads happens far too late in the development process (often in the meeting where a launch decision is being made!). Little has been done to fix these issues despite it being constant feedback for the past year. * Performance reviews put too much emphasis on immediate personal output rather than collaboration and assisting other teams. This causes teams and individuals to focus inwardly. While it's never been malicious, I've seen this behavior directly harm other team's productivity or metrics. * Work/life balance is below average on the day-to-day, but oncalls are truly awful. * Decision-making has become a bit too distributed between orgs and reflects in the overall product.

My team is incredibly diverse (including transgender, black, Asian, Pacific Islander, Latino, and an unusually high percentage of women) which shows both an extraordinary commitment to diversity and gives me faith that the product will be built to serve diverse customers. And the backgrounds of the people on my team are shockingly elite, with many projects on their resumes that are immediately familiar to and admired by me. I'm also proud that Facebook has so many people at the very top who are strongly committed to VR - like Zuckerberg's ambitious announcement at OC4 that his goal is to have a billion people in VR.
","Facebook is hugely committed to transparency and authentic identity. So if you value separating your personal life and work life, don't want to share your personal feelings with coworkers or hear about theirs (or offer emotional support), or don't like to share with other people in the broader company what you're working on, it may be a bad fit for you. Likewise, if you prefer to be directed by leadership rather than establishing your own direction autonomously, Facebook might be a bad fit for you. Finally, Facebook's primary Menlo Park campus is located in the middle of nowhere with very little else around - you eat and get all your services on campus, with the nearest downtown a 15 min drive away. If you prefer to be in an urban center, you should either consider a different location, or a different company.

They have put a lot of thought behind them and it's very inspiring to see what the company stands for on paper. - They are quite transparent when it comes to product strategy, roadmaps, etc. It's great how much they make you feel part of the success of the company. - Excellent benefits and perks. - Sheryl Sandberg. A thousand times.
","- If you land in the wrong team or are a victim of poor management, HR will not do anything about it, even if you have evidence. Firstly, they are severely understaffed (one HRBP per 200 managers?). - The feedback cycles are too political. This is one of the worst things about Facebook. It has 'imported' bad habits and bad people from other companies who brought their corporate baggage with them. It didn't used to be like this. - People work on projects based on their six-month feedback review, not what's good for a team or the company. The lack of accountability from upper management makes this much worse. People get promoted for 'inventing' things that get abandoned after a month. - If you are good at public relations but do nothing, you can get very far at Facebook. It means you have 'visibility'. It's poisonous. - It has become so cynical that the latest 'trick' to get someone promoted to director is for them to organise a 'global' gathering. In other words, bring a bunch of people to Menlo Park, say it's for team building and give it a funky name or a motto... and boom! They become a Very Senior Person. - Zero work/life balance. You must be available 24/7.

2017-12-07, Senior Product Manager,"Menlo Park, CA","Current Employee, more than 1 year","You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll drown, you'll wish you bought in 2012","I had 5+ years of pre-FB experience in tech and other industries, including others consistently in Glassdoor Top 10. I don't regret joining FB: - I've learned an incredible amount about a new tech stack and product management for ads in only a few months. Not all my peers are brilliant about all things (which is good, as I'm certainly not) but every one of them is smarter than I am about at least one thing, and it takes very little time to find out what. - Data and logic rule here -- not always, not entirely, but enough. There is enough of a culture of rigor to metrics that we still have a North Star when in the weeds. - The perks are great. I have gotten broken glasses fixed by the dry cleaner for only a low tax rate. The food is shockingly good for the scale of the cafes, and I'm impressed every day by the whole MPK service operation. - Workplace is much better than emails as a site for debate/discussion about what to do. Also a con, because it generates a game of how-should-i-react-on-Workplace all its own, and in a more public record.
","Facebook is like Bitcoin: people in it ask when you bought in because it's the easiest way to find out how powerful you are without being rude. I joined within the last year, along with about half of the company. The contrast in the level of success of people who joined N years ago vs N-2 years ago is logarithmic for all values of N. At its current rate, I don't think I can advise anyone to join now, and after I vest, I'm not sure I will stay. Part of this is that the starting comp isn't very good. The vesting stock is, but the cash is fairly mediocre (less than previous jobs I've had at far less profitable companies), and vesting accelerates over time. This nets to you being paid much more than before, year over year. The much greater share of it is that opportunities scaling in the same pyramid-growth path means that anyone thinking of joining today can't expect any of the same trajectory that available 2 years ago, and maybe even 1 year ago.

2017-12-05, Software Engineer,"Menlo Park, CA","Current Employee, less than 1 year",Best Large Tech Company Culture,"From the start, Facebook has been amazing. Bootcamp was a great experience; not too many companies let a new grad spend 6-8 weeks searching for a good team fit. They let you pick a team, which essentially means you get to pick your tech stack (Backend; Front-end; Mobile; Infrastructure), the org you work for (Messenger, Facebook, Oculus, Instagram, etc.). More importantly, you get to pick your manager + team mates, where as in other large companies, it's the other way around; you are assigned to a product & org & manager whether you like it or not. This is way different compared to Google's opaque 'host matching' process and Microsoft where they just randomly place you in a division like Azure or Office. The company values really shine through every day. Before Facebook I thought the concept of company values was kind of corny and B.S. Now that I'm at FB I can at least say that here the company values are actually values held by top management + majority of the workforce and not just marketing / HR speak. Everyday I really feel like we are moving fast and shipping a lot of product very quickly. We A/B test lots of features, analyze the data, and swiftly decide what to ship to the public. I never feel stuck; I always feel like I'm either implementing an A/B test or analyzing data so we can ship more features. There are not long product cycles with lots of prognostication from product leadership; we build, measure, then learn. Thats it. I feel everyday that we have an open culture. At Facebook, we use Workplace, a tool thats kind of like Facebook but for corporations, made by you guessed it... Facebook. Within Workplace, just like normal FB, there are a ton of groups. I'm in a bunch of groups and basically get visibility on decision making + product updates + news from every part of our org. I feel like I'm in the loop and just learn so much about FB / product by reading my Workplace newsfeed. For example, today I read a research report about internet users in India, learned some stuff about dynamic ads, and saw one of the senior leaders announce a new partnership deal. All of that info isn't directly relevant to my day-to-day job, but because its all there and open to anyone, I learn so much and have so much clarity into FB's product vision & company objectives. Mark or Shreyl do Q & A's every Friday. Between hearing top leadership speak, and reading updates from every part of the company on Workplace, I feel that FB is a very open and transparent place to work. There are many other pros and cultural values that I like but let me get to a major pro to end this review. Food! Here's just a sample from today! I ate these 3 meals today at the company cafe 2 mins walk away from my desk. Breakfast: Soft Boiled Egg + Been + Cheese + Salsa Tostada. Organic Blueberries & Blackberries. Hemp & Pumpkin seeds. Lunch: Vegetarian Pho with Sous Vide Eggs, Tofu, Steamed Cabbage, Green Onions, Cilantro, & Bean Sprouts in it. Added Sriracha and Chili Oil to spicen it up. Thai Iced Tea Bobba (Bubble) Tea. Dinner (today was Jamaican themed): Sweet Potato & Corn Casserole, Collared Greens, Fried Plantains, & Quinoa. I also got a slice of cheese pizza :) Dessert: Mango Cheesecake made with Graham Cracker Crust. By the way, the menu rotates, and at the HQ, there are a ton of cafes to choose from so way more options for food are there.
","Work life balance is tough. Can have some busy weeks due to the ""move fast"" culture. Plus you have a lot of ownership which brings with it some stress. The offices are crowded due to how fast we are growing. They are building a few new huge buildings but until those finish things are quite cramped, and the work place can get loud. Also not enough space in the gyms because of the general overcrowding on campus.

I've noticed the following: 1) The company embodies ""move fast"". If you can prove you can create a vision and build momentum for a product and a team, you will be given the reins to move as fast as you can at FB. I've taken a project from 0 to 1 to launch in 4 countries in 4 months. 2) The company embodies ""be bold"". There are no ""small swings"" around here. There might be a lot of incremental work, optimization and tweaking on all fronts but when the company realizes progress needs to be done in an area, it's no holds barred. The big bet I'm currently leading has lead to 2 teams merging and org structures adapting to enable that shift. 3) The company embodies ""be open"" - There is a transparency to the decision making, be it at team level or at management and leadership level I've never encountered before. It's refreshing to be able to ask any question I want to Mark every Friday during the Q&A for instance.
","One thing has underwhelmed me and that is that management isn't as available as I wish it would be. For instance, I would have loved the opportunity to meet and learn from higher-ups and more experienced people more often but am unable to find time on their calendars (Still trying though).

2017-10-15, Product Specialist,"Menlo Park, CA","Current Employee, less than 1 year","Believe the hype, this is by far the best place I've ever worked","Not even sure where to start. It goes without saying that this company takes GREAT care of its employees, and then some. The work is challenging and super intense, but the positive and collaborative cultre, along with all of the perks/benefits offered, make the intensity much easier to deal with as opposed to any other company I've worked for. I've been at FB for a bit over four months, but I knew during my interviews (btw these were the hardest interviews I've ever had) that this was the place to be. From application to job offer, it took 6 weeks. When I got the offer, it was so strong that there as no need to negotiate. When I got the job and relocated from NY to CA, the relocation package was was so good I didn't have to raise a finger or spend a dime. Already knew at that point that this company knows how to retain talent. This place truly rewards merit, courage, and being outspoken. Management is aware enough (at least in my space) to place me in a role that plays to my strengths, and I've enjoyed th freedom to make my role what I want to be. They are very outspoken when you're performing well and are honest about things that need improvement. If you have a good idea that is supported by data and aligns well with the goals of your team or whatever your target population may be, you will find resources or people to join you in your efforts. From hackathons to day-to-day work, this culture permeates every area of the company. One thing that strikes me the most is how strong the diverse community (however small) is within this company. There are a lot of resources put towards ERG/FBRG efforts, and as a diverse employee, this means A LOT to me. I know the norm is to move around the industry every five years or so, but I don't see myself leaving this company for a long time. In just four months, I feel deeply rooted here, and I intend be here for a while. If you're reading this, there should be no question about applying, interviewing, or accepting an offer. You'll be happy that you made the decision.
","This may be limited to my team or my area of the company, but I believe there is an underlying ""me, me, me"" culture at FB. There is a constant need to make your work visible so that others know what you're doing and so that whoever has a similar idea doesn't take the shine before you do. Separately, everyone wants to do knock-out work, and at times are secretive about the things that they're working on so that they can have that ""holy crap"" moment when they finally finish and reveal the results of their work. This can result in wasted resources and time since multiple people/small groups coule be working on the same thing without knowing it. Not sure what the solution is, but this at times takes away from collaborative work. I identify it as a con, but I've quickly found myself doing the same thing, and that's just because it's an underlying, unspoken culture at the company.

2017-10-15, Production Engineer,"Menlo Park, CA","Current Employee, less than 1 year","Wonderful people, fun work, great culture","Comp, benefits, and perks are incredible. Company culture is so, so good. I've had two great managers who both have done an excellent job supporting my growth and guiding my career. It also feels like senior and C-level management really cares about employees. It feels like Facebook the company really tries to support me as a whole person (but be sure to ask for what you need! nobody's a mind reader). For eng, bootcamp and team selection are such a good idea. I freaking love my team, and I get to own my decision to join that team (rather than some hiring/allocation manager deciding where I get to go). Very few operational rules/bureaucracy. I can ssh into any machine I need to. If someone's fighting a fire anywhere in the company and I am able to help, I feel like I can always jump in to help. I really like Infra, so being at a big company like FB is super fun.
","Oncalls can kill your sleep during your oncall shift if things are noisy overnight There's a little bit of an ""always on-the-grid"" culture which contributes towards the 4/5 work/life balance, but it's generally not too hard to fight it. Most people who work a lot end up doing it because they're passionate about their work, anyway.

Having had a job at Facebook makes it pretty easy to at least get interviews anywhere else. The perks and benefits are also fantastic, and the pay is great.
","SO MANY. Again, the glamor of working at Facebook was enough, for a while. And when the company and research team were smaller, it was a lot better. But now, the research culture at Facebook is *TOXIC*. Management is full of people who are there because they want to further their careers, not because they want to help their team members grow. I had a string of awful managers, one of whom actively discouraged me from following my ambitions. (Note that not all managers are awful, some were amazing and I sought them out as mentors instead of my own managers.) Being a researcher at Facebook - especially from 2015 on, was discouraging and miserable enough that it ruined my confidence in my own abilities. Researchers were competitive with each other, and instead of focusing on improving the product, focused on edging out their colleagues for opportunities and recognition. I know several wonderful people who left the company because of the toxic atmosphere and poor management.

2017-09-25, Site Logistics Analyst,,"Current Employee, less than 1 year",My Personal Point of View,"Open culture Our mission here at Facebook is to give people the power to build communities and to bring the world closer. This is something we live by in the workplace as well. No idea is a dumb one and you are encouraged to make an impact. Facebook tends to take simple life stressors away so that you can concentrate on what's important; bringing the world closer. Some of the perks include: Breakfast, lunch, and dinner are offered to you at no cost. You receive assistance when you are a newly expecting parent. Facebook also has great wellness package to the point they will reimburse your gym membership fees and the list goes on and on. Furthermore, Management understands that you are a valuable member of the team and you are treated as such. It can be surreal sometimes.
","There are absolutely no cons to working here.

2017-09-22, Recruiter,"Menlo Park, CA","Former Employee, more than 1 year",Recruiting's Rejects,"- Benefits are second to none. They give you a lot but they also expect a lot from you as well. - The company is innovating and revenue growth is phenomenal. Which means the equity value grows significantly YoY. - Comp is good here. Facebook generally overpays a lot of recruiters compared to Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. This could be attributed to desperation because of how difficult it's been to hire recruiters.
","- The bar has significantly dropped in recruiting. Because of the hyper growth Facebook is going through they've been forced to hire inexperienced recruiters and also rejects who weren't able to hack it in other top tech companies & start-ups. It used to mean a lot to be a full time recruiter at Facebook. Now it feels like they're giving an offer to anyone with a pulse. Inexperienced recruiters or bad ones can attribute to poor candidate experience and headaches for other recruiters. - Performance Reviews many times aren't a true reflection of individual performance. It's a problem that many companies have and Facebook is one of them. - The company has become so corporate. It's like you're just another number and the impact you're making is insignificant. - Work Life Balance is terrible. In order to be successful here you'll need to work well over 50 hours per week.

2017-09-11, Engineering Manager,"London, England, England","Current Employee, less than 1 year",Such a great place to work,"The culture here is fantastic; there are so many things that just work well together. For example, most engineers choose which team to join after the first 6 weeks or so, which encourages a lot of really positive behaviours. The company is also really open, allowing everyone to make great decisions: if you need access to some data, you probably have it available. We have good tools and infrastructure that allows us to focus on the important things; things like booking a meeting room, following up on a task in a common system and many other things are just easy, using great tools that an internal team builds and maintains. I also think that the engineering-led approach to product development and a willingness to try things is really special, and allows us to be more bold than most other companies. Oh, and the free food! Breakfast, lunch and dinner, with lots of great options, both healthy and not-so-healthy.
","It's not a great place if you value being in charge, or being told specifically what to do when. Everyone is expected to be self-led to a large extent.

","Since I'm straight out of college and have only been at the company around a year, I don't feel any problems with the work/life balance. Maybe down the line when I have a wife and kids, but Facebook is pretty cognizant that maintaining W/L balance is a really big thing in the valley.

Work is quite challenging and the perks are probably one of the best in the industry
","1. If you are in ops, it is really hard to have leverage, since it is an engineering-centric company, which is expected and ops is considered more ""support"" and ""cleaning up the mess"" type of role. 2. Because FB is quite the name, it is easier to hire a new person than hire someone internally. Since every single employee here, there are tons of other talented people outside that can be hired. So turnover happens for those that burnout or are stagnating in their roles and cannot progress. If you are in a non-tech role, it can feel like you are ""replaceable"" because there are 100's if not 1000's of people waiting in line to get your role that does something that is not as advanced as coding or building production code. 3. work/life balance as most say can take a toll on you, but this is up to you take control. 4. because everyone is really talented and the best, it is hard to get promoted unless you are the most prolific unicorn amongst all of the unicorns. It is still, however, a good starting point if you get hired.

The best part is that you really are working towards a greater good in helping people all around the world connect and come closer together through an online community (even if you aren't directly on the engineering/product side - somebody has to make sure the lights can afford to stay on). Everybody is crazy smart, and each employee is cherry picked to make sure they have the right personality to fit in with the overall culture. Perks are great (vacation time, unlimited food and drinks, gym subsidizes), but what makes this job great is your ability to fail and learn from your mistakes without feeling like you truly failed. A lot of flexibility in terms of career projection based on your passions, skills and interests. Ability to control worklife balance so you don't feel stressed out and overworked.

What sticks out most to me is that the company is accutley aware that it won't be able to reach it's long term goals without tenured (more than 2-3 years) employees. It goes to great lengths to remove everyday hassles from your life so you can spend more time doing the things you love outside of work and when life happens (babies, relocation, bereavement) it's most amazing perk shines through. The people around you come together to support you and give you the time you deserve to move through life changes. They really look at it through the lens of ""if the employee is happy and taken care of then they'll do the best work of their career"". This doesn't mean that everyone will work 80 hours a week.

2017-07-17,Anonymous,,Current Employee,Hired into an executive role at Facebook,"As an establish Silicon Valley executive, Facebook moved fast in courting me and offering me a competitive package. They have excellent on-boarding and training programs: for individual contributors, for managers, and at the executive levels. Senior leadership is very approachable. Its straightforward to find good mentors and collaborative partners. The ""social networking"" that goes on inside the company is richly informative and generally very positive. Despite being a large company, it retains a youthful feel, with an appetite for risk and decisive action which is dazzling given the scale and the weighty consequences that entails. People are honest and direct, and ""company politics"" is discouraged by a robust culture that strives to keep alive the best of Facebook-- while also staying pragmatic and adaptable. The company is earnest and generally unflinching in applying its principles. Especially, it moves fast and gets things done. Earnest and purposeful. Human executed processes, around hiring and planning, are tight and well reasoned.
","The company is so driven by short-term impact that it is relatively harder here to carve out large, long-term plans. Work-life balance can be an issue. Separation of professional life and personal life is less here than some might be comfortable with. Internal tools and quality can be lacking -- but there is a rising commitment toward changing that.

2017-07-17, Operations Manager,"Dublin, Dublin","Current Employee, more than 1 year",Best career move ever!,"> Open Culture: decisions are announced openly, without sugar coating and pretence and it comes from the very top! Mark, Sheryl and all the leaders are very straight forward on their answers during the weekly Q&A - there is nothing they shine away from and, when they don't know much about the topic they either find somebody that does or follow it up. > Real flat organisation: many other companies misinterprete what employees mean by 'flat organisation' - they are not talking about the number levels between junior and senior people, but on how open senior leadership is. FB doesn't make that mistake, you can talk to anybody here, from managers to directors and VPs and they all listen to you attentively, as a peer, not as a 'superior'. Employees at FB are all valued the same. > Perks are amazing: it is not about the amount of perks, but how those perks make your life much better. Instead of trowing whatever at employees, FB conducts regular surveys to understand which benefits are valued or not and adjust them accordingly. The benefits provided by FB are geared towards making our lifes easier, so we can focus more on giving people the power to build communities and bring the world closer together.
","> In the spirit of moving fast, our tools are not extremely sophisticated as they are being continuously developed. It is a price I am happy to pay to have the benefit of doing whatever I need to accomplish the company's goals. > Working with smart and ambitious people is amazing, but can, at times, make you feel an 'impostor' - I think everyone here does feel like that sometimes, but if well taken, can only make us continuously improve and become a better professional

For me this was an absolute shock (having a 30 min fast paced meeting which resulted in almost immediate high impacting changes) - Passion; you are encouraged to focus on your strengths and work on the issues that you find most rewarding! - The people; I've never worked with so many motivated, passionate and intelligent people - it really brings the best out of you. Further, you are encouraged to be your 'authentic self' which often means direction to have a better work-life balance! - Of course... the perks are AMAZING - great pay, yummy food (yet the ""facebook 13"" is oh too real!'and the best healthcare among many well thought out perks.
","- Despite the amazing perks for new parents (lots of leave!), childcare support is minimal if anything. - Encouraging everyone to be their 'authentic selves' sometimes can cause issues (ie. some people - very few though - are authentic knob heads). - Moving sometimes too fast to enable a reliable and trusting service; although its really encouraging to see this is being worked on from top down! - The perks are AMAZING yet, as is probably human nature, its always tempting to look over to Google's better perks (yet they don't have our outstanding open culture which is perhaps more valuable)

","For what you get in perks you need to be ready to sacrifice work/life balance. You will be spending most of your time either working or hanging out with colleagues Sometimes unhealthy amount of travelling (which is not always necessary in modern world where you have video conferences) Middle management is bad. People who are promoted into the roles very often are not ready and not much willing to learn how to manage people. There are no poor decisions by managers. They will always be right. There is a big gap between the ideas of the head office and the actual needs in different country markets. Facebook is becoming big and slow machine when it comes to actions and decision-making.

","Reviews cause an unhealthy amount of anxiety among employees, sink or swim environment. Managers are expected to be in this role because they like people management and there is no additional comp for this role nor does the amount of time spent managing or mentoring get reflected in reviews.

2017-05-08, Business Operations,"Menlo Park, CA","Former Employee, more than 3 years",Great Place to Work but,"- At it's best working at Facebook is fast paced, fun and extremely impactful. I've been given opportunities to work with many great colleagues who care deeply about the work that you're doing and will challenge and encourage you to do better. - Support staff at Facebook is amazing whether it be the people who greet you in the morning, facilities, IT, the security guards, chefs, or the the people who work at the gym. Everyone is super friendly and has your best interest at heart. It's like going to work at a 5 Star Hotel every single day :) - Feedback is taken very seriously and typically acted upon. For example a couple of years ago Facebook didn't offer 4 months paternity leave for employees outside of the US and after receiving feedback from international employees this was policy was expanded globally - Perks are amazing, free food, gym (or membership for offices without gyms), laundry, great healthcare.
","- Mid-level managers are a hit or miss. I've had 4 different managers in 3 years at Facebook and my experience at work has greatly been dependent on how competent they are. My best manager pushed me and opened doors and was a true advocate for me within the company, whereas my worst manager who was also a first time manager made me feel as if I was working on an island. If you're joining Facebook in a non-tech role you should definitely try your best to get a feel for your future manager. - As the company has hired over 10K+ people over the past 3 years roles and responsibilities are definitely becoming more specialized and opportunities to drive tangible impact are becoming increasingly difficult for people in junior roles - Pay and benefits for people working in international offices are not comparable to working at HQ. For example IVF is offered in the US but not non-US offices.

They study everything and then to the best thing - if you don't like data, don't come here! All voices are equal & everyone is encouraged to participate in the conversation. In fact, if you don't - that is bad. But be prepared to back up what you say. And know you will get direct feedback on how you can get better, because we all can. Feedback is real and designed to help you get better, not judge you. Overall, an amazing place that moves fast towards a clear mission that everyone in the company is behind.

It is hands down the best place I have ever worked. To be frank, I didn't have high expectations going in that it would be very different from the misogynistic cultures I've had to navigate at previous companies. Before working at Facebook, I'd kind of come to accept that being a female engineer would always be a somewhat isolating existence and the best I could do would be to find a team with 90% great colleagues and just try and avoid the creepy and rude ones as much as possible. I'd seen that as long as they performed well (or held some other utilitarian value for the company) they would always have a place in a company and their treatment of women would be an open secret and accepted. Honestly, my first couple months at Facebook made me aware of how much effort I'd been spending navigating those types of situations. It's incredible working with people who assume your competence rather than constantly having to battle to prove yourself. It's amazing seeing constant efforts towards dissecting internalized biases and senior male employees openly discussing their efforts to catch themselves unconsciously interrupting people. It's laughable to try to imagine this happening at my previous companies. It's so precious being able to find a place where you can just focus on your work.

Sure, perfect is the enemy of good enough, but if a temporary shortcut remediates a problem or a need, it's quickly iterated to improve, all the while immersed in a tech culture: Pusheen, Archer, Dr Who, Starwars, memes, the micro-actions that continually reinforce a culture-fit or a culture-miss. I'm in the culture fit. Sure, I get a very competitive salary, plus my tech chops improve (when C++ gurus review your work, your C++ quality improves), and the food, and the perks, but above all, this is the place I feel I most fit. I'm in my mid-40s. I ""get schooled"" my mid-20s. ...and it's awesome.
","Pace is a killer. The work is complex, as are the discussions about it, I have little fuel in my head to code after work. Big personal desire to keep up to the more efficient engineers. I don't want to pass-a-fault, but want to move-fast, get all the things done. It's exhausting!

Really Underrated in the Valley, IMO...","There are an endless amount of pros about working at Facebook. If I were to pick one pro out of all of them - it's the people. Whatever you heard or read about Facebook really doesn't give the place enough credit. I'm not in HR/recruiting or even management, but I do see a common trend in everyone they bring on board. Everyone is smart, motivated, non-judgemental, and freakishly CARING. There are so many people with heart at FB. To be honest, you can be one heck of a coder, but if you're selfish - I don't think you will get hired here. I've previously worked at Google and MSFT; FB blows both of them out of the water (maybe I'm a little biased). Other pro's of course are... + Free world class food options all day long on the main campus cafeteria (MPK 20/21).This includes great snacks/drink options everywhere else as well. + Fantastic PPO/HMO health care options. The premiums are very reasonable. + Resources. They will give you everything you need so you can do an amazing job - period. Hardware, software, etc... + Did I mention the people? :)

","The values do not apply in GMS (Sales teams) and even less in regions that are not in US. The LatinAmerican management is irresponsible. There are problems in each country in terms of compensation and growth opportunities. The worst experience is the recruiting process with tons of promises through the phone and they are not able to send you a written offer until you have accepted & signed online. After your first paycheck you notice that they didn't get all the benefits that were promised through the phone, because ""they couldn't write it on the contract where you could only see your yearly compensation"" ""because they were local benefits"". Salary payment processes are outsourced and unmanaged by internal teams, resulting on taxing issues and each country's inflation and devaluation affecting the life quality of the employees by not being able to adjust the salaries when all living costs have dramatically increased. The local management teams are not receptive on the employees concerns. In each region; salaries and seniority levels are given not by real performance or experience but by relationships. There is retaliation on complains, there have been open ""advices"" to avoid complaining. This is worrying for a company with the open culture like Facebook.

High level of independence and reliance on individuals doing what they see as the best use of their talents for the company (with guidance from managers and others if needed). Each team is a little different in how they operate, but because you can pick your team after you join (and have gone through bootcamp and met many of them), you can find the fit that matches you. And if you find you need a change at some point, then you just find the next team/project (or come up with your own) that again satisfies you and helps the company as much as possible. The perks are awesome. Free food, snacks. Lots of variety, high quality. Great benefits - I'm a big fan of the onsite medical/dental options.

They really care about their employees. - Lavish, almost extravagant benefits: you can get spa massages reimbursed, for instance.
","- Facebook feels like a young and aggressive teenager. Granted, its prime focus is to grab a bigger slice of pie from Google but that seems to be driving its entire business strategy. - Hyderabad undergoes re-orgs way too frequently, which has resulted in mass attrition with several senior managers moving on. - Under-hiring talent: There is no difference between the role/designation of an ISB MBA with 3 years of solid work ex and an undergrad fresher from a local college. HR needs to work out this motivational deterrent else attrition is set to rise. - Inverted pyramid hiring in the sales team: Way too many senior and mid-level managers are being hired as individual contributors for roles that are given to college grads in other locations. Limited growth opportunities because of this.

","For a social company, face to face interaction with most management lacked depth..managers are always so busy and in a rush, and then it was on to liking and commenting on the next thing in their newsfeed, the next urgent request, the next team to manage... You see many employees managing ""their internal brand"" and posturing via their fb posts. It is exhausting. Senior executives are driving government politics not shared openly with employees.

* At this point in the organization's life they are more inclined to hire managers from outside instead of promoting from within. Many employees have been burned by violated expectations around this.

2017-01-09, Software Engineer,"Seattle, WA","Current Employee, less than 1 year",Awesome office in Seattle!,"- Internal tooling: Coming from Microsoft, the internal tooling here is nothing short of incredible. Everything just *works*, and it's mostly consistent throughout the entire company. Everyone uses the same code review process. Everyone uses the same build tools. Everyone uses the same check in process (per repository). Everyone uses the same employee feedback process. etc... There are also lots of internal services that are really helpful. Services for deployment, managing configuration, a/b testing, etc. Because everyone uses the same tools, everyone invests in them and they're well-documented, easy to learn, etc. - People: everyone I've worked with is really smart and happy to lend a helping hand. Haven't had any issues so far. - Work: I've enjoyed the kind of problems that I get to solve at Facebook much more than the kind of problems I got to solve at Microsoft. I worked on four different teams at Microsoft. The problems here are more challenging and require scalable, efficient solutions. - Culture: The culture here is fantastic. Internally, there is a lot of transparency. There isn't too much politics. You can make improvements on part of the codebase. There isn't much process to slow you down. There is a lot of individual freedom in what your prioritize and work on. - Work life balance: I've had great work life balance here. I typically work 35-40 hours a week, and I've not once stayed late for dinner. On-call is pretty light--much easier than on-call at Microsoft. This might vary by team. - Food: Really good food. Lots of healthy options (and unhealthy options if you want a cheat day). - Benefits: Pretty happy with the benefits. The transportation options are really good. The baby benefits are great.
