2. You will get salary before time.
","1. After appointing as fresher they will make you work however they want. Even if you want to work as developer not automation engineer..it doesn't matter to them.
2. Mentors will treat you nothing. Humiliate you in every meeting and don't help or reply to messages.
3. You need to get permission for everything you do in daily basis and mentors won't reply.
4. Will shout on juniors in public.
4. Team members seeing your condition, try to take advantage of you in any way they want. They are good in manipulating the mind of new comers.
Advice to Management
Don't ruin people's life. New comers are also people. Also see in what field other person want to work.
In other companies if some one shouts or talk regarding the personal things which are outside boundaries..it is considered as offence and they are punished by law.
If some one is more experienced doesn't mean he is god and other is useless.
Don't give opportunity to people when they are asking to leaving the organization.

","I worked for Thermo Fisher for three years and my experience at this company was life stripping, dreadful, unpleasant, and very inconvenient. The way you are treated really depends on your management. In this job as a black male people have a tendency to control you, manipulate you, and overwork you. I applied for a senior scientist position and Thermo Fisher was really about sales at that time so my position wasn’t really what it was suppose to be. I worked mostly on sales, and really all Thermo Fisher cares about is sales. If you are looking for a job that is involving science this job will not be suitable for you, they stripped away science from me and I really felt like a technician and sales man. During this terrible time in the pandemic, Thermo had no pardon. I was overworked and was not able to balance my work life with my life outside of work, I was barely able to spend time with family, I felt as if I was pulled away from life. When I decided to leave the company for my own good, I gave a two week notice to my boss because I found a more suitable job for me. I called my boss to let him know that I’m resigning and gave him a two week notice. That very same day after the call, my boss terminated me and his reasoning was that I “did not disclose the company I’m going to”. They terminated without even allowing me to have an exit interview with Thermo Fisher Human Resources to know the reason I’m resigning. That shows you that the culture at Thermo Fisher is beneath employment standard. I’ve come on campus many times to train people on how to use bioreacters and different techniques and as a black male was looked down upon and had no support from my management team. I do not recommend this to anyone who wants to work in the science field and wants to balance family life with work life.

","If you're looking for somewhere to learn and develop good habits as a lean manufacturing engineer focused on continuous improvement, this is NOT the place for you. Be prepared to fight fires like never before. Be prepared for management and executive leadership to make uninformed decisions from an ivory tower. Be prepared to have little or no direction with project work. And lastly, be prepared for a barrage of negativity from all directions. The culture, particularly in production, is extremely toxic. While the associates are, for the most part, pleasant folks, the challenges they face every day just to do their jobs brings most of them down to a place of toxic negativity that spreads like a cancer. Do not be misled by the fact that this is a ""Thermo Fisher Scientific"" plant. There is very little science to be found here. Other plants within the division refer to this plant as 'the wild west.'
Advice to Management
There likely needs to be a major overhaul of the current management structure if any tangible change is going to take place. The current management team is like the popular group in high school. They're a tight clique and everyone else is on the outside, including when it comes to making decisions that affect the plant.

2021-09-09, Finance,,"Former Employee, more than 3 years",Highly dysfunctional,"Decent pay, 401(k), nothing else
","- Highly political. All that matters is who you impress. Leadership is incredibly obsessed with optics. It’s all dog and pony. The CFO is only focused on the most superficial items (when he’s not talking about himself) and never focuses on work, knowledge and quality.
- Far too many incompetent employees. Honestly, I don’t think 20% of the Finance staff have a clue what they are doing. They are constantly makes mistakes.
- You are always fixing someone’s mistakes and they keep making them. You would almost think it was their job to make mistakes.
- Leadership plays favorites and they aren’t subtle about it. I’ve seen people ignore emails, make major mistakes, lie, but as long as they parrot the cliche business jargon and brown nose, they are leadership’s favorite.
- Did I already mention leadership’s uselessness? All they do is set up meetings to book up their calendars and look busy.
- Lazy, lazy, lazy staff. I think I can count on one hand the number of people who I’ve worked with who were not lazy.
- I hope you enjoy tire tracks because you will be thrown under the bus a lot. And they plan on running you over.
- Your hard work and efficiencies will not be appreciated. All they will do is give you someone else’s work, while that person does close to nothing.
- Incredibly superficial. They will thank a highly compensated consultant for doing next to nothing but not say a word when you worked all night to meet a deadline.
- Unfortunately, most companies are just as bad.

The sick time/ vacation time gets all piled together, so I have 2 weeks total that I can take off, so it’s a risk to take vacation time incase you need that extra time for if you get sick. 
The culture at my specific location is incredibly toxic and cliquey, I feel as though I don’t fit in. 
Management is a joke, there is no QC manager to run the department. Just a few supervisors who are in way over their head. 
There are not enough people in the group

Hire more people, hire a manager. The current system isn’t working. Also we are all adults, it’s okay for people to become friends at work, but for cliques to form is another issue. Get it together

","Potentially great job ruined by management with an axe to grind. Zero concept of the job being done by lower level staff. Would sooner promote favourites rather than examine their merits.

Promises open roads of progression, but you will not receive them unless you are liked. No matter how hard you work for it. Get a years experience and move on before you run out of options.

Other companies pay significantly more for a more relaxed, worthwhile employment
Advice to Management
Try looking at someone’s performance overall before you judge them. Promoting the person that brown noses you best drives honest workers away. You’re a manager, not a mate.

","This company does not care about it's employees. They constantly send out emails stating how many millions of dollars in profits they are making but then treat their employees with zero respect. If you like being over worked, having no work home life balance, being poorly paid, having awful medical coverage and not having basic amenities on site then this is the place for you. They spend too much time hiring managers and having no workers to do the actual work. Every process that cooperate ""improves"" makes it harder and harder to get your work done. Its disgusting that a company making so much money can't even get their employees decent medical coverage. I still spent over $10,000 out of pocket last year on medical bills because the horrible insurance they have covers nothing. Women are treated like second class citizens at this company. They have so little respect for us that they can't even put feminine product disposal bins in the bathroom stalls. The toilet water sprays all over the toilet in the women's bathroom. It's disgusting. If you move up in the company they don't pay you fair wages for the job that you are doing, but they have no problems hiring people in off the street (at a lower level than you are) for more money. They cut off access to entrances to buildings with no warning so you then have to walk over half a mile around the entire plant to get to another entrance (all while in debilitating pain because you can't afford anymore medical bills). You are forced to work well over 40 hours a week and weekends with no overtime. This company does not care about anything other than it's own profits. They will take every short cut they can to get there. They have useless groups at this plant like security and HR, who never do their job and pass everything off onto someone else so nothing is ever resolved. They can't even put up decent cameras in the parking lot so when some hits your car and drives off there is nothing you can do but get stuck with another bill you can' afford because they pay you so little. Last year we lost 19 out of 32 people in our group. But the company does not care. They hardly even replace them. They just pass off more work to others and keep burning them out too. People are sick of being over worked and not respected by this company. Run do not walk as far away from this company as you possibly can.

Advice to Management
Salary and benefits for the employees are always the key factor to attract or retain the talented / experienced employees. Perhaps the company could have consistent review and do timely adjustment of pay and benefit for those long service employees so that they can feel that their years of experience and contribution are really appreciated over the years instead of rely on yearly basis increment. 

For example, fresh graduate market salary is increased to average $3.5K at outside life science market however, this salary is almost take 4 to 5 years accumulated from annual increment from those who joined years ago. Without timely review, their base salary gap is getting bigger to outside market over the years and employees will start to think of leaving the company instead of motivating them to have more contribution to the organization.

","There is NO training, the packaging department I worked in was extremely unorganized and mismanaged, you're hired and thrown into the mix without much acclimation and expected to manage very process heavy projects without any guidance or support. Very very high turnover as a result of no training, management appears not to understand this correlation.
People are hired to alleviate the turn over, but are not trained, which creates a bottleneck of untrained people and more work for veteran employees in the long run. Suggestions to fix this are not well received.
Advice to Management
Train people, provide support for new hires and veteran workers alike, organize the department so it is actually functional.

2021-07-16, Senior Sales Operations Analyst,"Baltimore, MD",Current Employee,Good and Bad of TFS,"Bonuses are very generous. Pay and benefits on par with most large corporation. Excellent opportunities for remote work for white collar employees. Opportunity to transfer within company to different positions.
","Still a great place to be a white male otherwise TFS still needs lots of work. Claims to be woke and inclusive but divisional managers could care less. As a women I have personally experienced and witnessed towards other women and minorities harassment, micro-aggression, hostile work environment and discrimination from the male dominated management team . Its very much a boys club. Until TFS gets serious about inclusion and diversity among managers, I don't see the issue fixing itself. With that being said, some divisions are better than others so do your homework. When interviewing ask about the management team and get a copy of the org chart; ask about turnover or if the person transferred. High turnover or transfer rate is not good sign. Research on LinkedIn for other that may have had that job at TFS and see how long they've been in the position or reach out and see if they'll answer your questions.
Advice to Management
Seriously consider your conscious and unconscious bias. Until you do, TFS isn't the best work environment. You and the company culture still needs a ton of work in this area. Continuing to shuttle the same white male management team around isn't the answer. You do a survey ever year but never seems to truly address the employee concerns maybe its because divisional and local management doesn't take it seriously and thinks it's joke. Maybe it's time to have employees rate management in the PMD process.

Supervisors (in most of the groups) are very understanding and will work with you and as hard as you do.
","Management is severely misplaced, most not having experience in this field but hired due to having a high level degree. A lot of miscommunications occur with having too many cooks. It doesn't help that with higher -up people not understanding the work and processes that occur in a Biotech company, which leads to a lot of unnecessary processes, instruments, and programs being used. I know it is still in start-up but I can see there being problems for a while until they get their bearings straight. Also, they have one recruiter that is notorious (everyone in the branch know and hate him, even supervisors and managers. A lot of them will go behind his back to the recruiting manager to work their own offers for people they want, as they have learned why it is hard to fill open spots) for horrible offers, while lying about compensation during the interview process, and when the offer comes it is way less than hat was agreed upon or the range implied. At the moment there is a departure of about an employee every other week from my branch and never from manufacturing. I have learned that they are, probably, the only group that is fair with compensation and responsibilities.

Benefits are in line with most big company.
","During my first 90 days here working at the Bedford, MA Poros BioProduction facility as a Quality Control Analyst/Formulation , I managed to learn a lot and how to navigate through the sometimes negative work environment.

The onboarding process and training program here is horrible and stressful. Most veteran workers here are just too busy with themselves and doesn't make time to embrace new employee. 

Most trainer lacks knowledge and enthusiasm.
Some trainers just doesn't do their job at all. They often just leaves new trainee neglected.

","Interoffice politics often get in the way of making progress.
Size of company and frequent mergers and acquisitions means it's difficult to know who does what and no one does the same thing.
Average-to-below-average compensation unless you're in management.
Very poor handling of return to work guidance post-pandemic.
Does not offer equal access to remote work opportunities (management is allowed to swap to remote, average workers are not).

","Base pay is low and no career progression. Seen technicians work for 5-6 years before even being considered to be promoted to senior technician. They would rather hire a senior technician than to promote one of their own technician who is fully capable. 

Company also likes to promote that they have a high employment rate but in actual fact, it’s due to turnover rate being really high hence resulting in the need to hire for replacement.

2021-06-17," Manager, R&D","San Diego, CA","Current Employee, more than 3 years",Stable company with solid values,"Performance oriented but humane leadership that makes smart investments, and fosters a collaborative work climate. Internal talent gets developed by trainings and possibilities of lateral moves. Multiple grass root and public outreach efforts that are supported by leadership. Pretty decent benefits and work life balance. Good work climate, fitness center, good lunch options on site and nearby. Family friendly, open to flexible hours if it does not interfere with performance.
","It’s a big company, which provides stability and options but it also limits operational flexibility by requiring more bureaucracy. No onsite child care options. Compensation may not be above industry average but the pros make up for it in my opinion.
Advice to Management
Upper management stepped up their game in giving back and being more tuned into their workforce. This definitely improved engagement and the feeling of being valued. Recruiting efforts need to be taken up a notch, especially in the current hot market in life tech.

","- employees are stretched beyond office hours for trivial issues such as meetings, plannings, open-source projects(excluding 8 hours of deliverables/day)
- resources shared across multiple projects without sync across managers. No priority set for deliverables
- An immediate joinee will be expected to give 30, 60, 90 day presentations where new design changes need to be proposed for product; these presentations will be equivalent to interviews where management will mock your efforts stating you need to scale
-any new technology or technically interesting problem must be taken up on weekends and beyond office hours
- for a new joinee, a 'major secret project' will be assigned which cannot be spoken of and must be done beyond office hours. In case you deny, they will keep requesting you to take it up in 1-to-1 meetings with manager
- toxic work culture as due to above points, everyone is stretched all the time. For a new joinee, no time to understand the product, your buddy will also not have time to help you out as he/she is stretched as well
- lengthy meetings extended for trivial issues. 15-30 mins Scrum goes on from 1-1.5 hours. Other than this, 4-5 hours of meetings every day for developers other than their 8 hours of dev work. You can expect a a 10.30 PM call in the morning followed by a 6 am call in the morning 
- aggresive management where they may insult/scold you in monthly meetups when your demo your leanings
- No process for anything. Right from onboarding, to setup, to access to offboarding, everything was a mess. eg : Getting access to Jira, Confluence took a month. 
**poor work life balance, toxic culture. One may be mentally impacted to work normal hours after being a part of this organization
Advice to Management
- Please respect your employees and have a professional code of conduct
- Treat your employees with respect
- Ensure work life balance by ensuring extended hours are not practiced unless critical(like production issue). Don't ask employees to extend regularly for trivial issues such as meetings, yearly planning
- Don't repeatedly ask your developers to participate in hackathons and open-source projects if they deny it. Delivering project work in time itself is demanding. Please check how other product based orgs are handling their developers
- If you're following agile, have dedicated scrum masters and product owners for all teams. Scrum master must ensure there are no external requests to the scrum team that may affect the deliverables
- Have separate SDETs for automation and product owners/scrum masters as manual testers

The team I worked with were easy to get along with, collaborative, supportive, and had a great sense of humor. Their short and long term disability is also excellent.
","Unfortunately for TFS as a whole as I understand it there is virtually almost no upward mobility and the starting pay at the bottom of the ladder is way below the industry as a whole. If you start as a material handler it's almost impossible to grow beyond that even if you have education or further training.
Advice to Management
This would be advice for TFS senior executives or state directors since managers of sites don't have the power to just raise pay however they want. Pay people a living wage starting at the bottom (i.e. the ability to comfortably afford a place to live within 20mi of the business site, start/support a family, pay living expenses, and take a nice vacation once a year). If your unwilling to do that then at least have ways to recognize talent or those whom are putting in extra effort to succeed to allow them to have more professional upward mobility.

","Leadership demonstrates favortism, as some with only a couple of years of professional experience are promoted to Senior Manager or even Director. Politics in the company is enabled by leadership's lack of will to administer discipline, which results in fiscal consequences. Toxic culture, and toxic work life balance. Many are expected to work and respond to work 24/7. Easy to burn out here.
Advice to Management
Too many inexperienced leaders in charge, and many are promoted too early in their career to be effective. The mistreatment of your skilled individual contributors is why many of them leave.

2021-05-27, Engineer,"Bridgewater, NJ","Current Employee, more than 5 years",5 years later - a great career choice,"This is a company that has longevity and stability.

The senior leadership will give bonuses to all colleagues when the corporation does really well. From 2020 until now, the company has issued 6 weeks of bonus pay to all everyone but the most senior leaders (who I assume get paid plenty). I'm not expecting that to continue forever, but it's great that they are comfortable sharing part of the wealth.

You can make a career here by applying for different roles both at a local site and across the global Thermo Fisher Community. There is opportunity for upward trajectory.

The Engineering Department is never boring. You learn something new every day. Often the new thing to learn starts with ""What is that and what on earth does it do?""
","Like most large corporations, you can feel like a number sometimes.

Pay is fair compared to the overall market. There is an aspect of trading a higher salary for job security.

Communications from the top tends to be geared towards personnel who have ready access to a computer or company issued mobile phone. It can be challenging to get the CEO's guidance to colleagues who do not have these things: like production and warehouse personnel.
Advice to Management
Always continue to innovate communications all the way to front line production colleagues.

2021-05-26,Anonymous,,Current Employee,"Great Experience, Poor Work Life Balance","1.) Business is booming with the pandemic, so there is job security.
2.) Frequent bonuses when the company is doing well.
3.) Learn a lot about how a large company runs and it's different systems/interactions.
","1.) As the title says, there is poor work life balance at Thermo Fisher. Expect to work more than 40 hours and do the jobs of 2-3 people. I frequently saw emails come in past 10 PM and sometimes even 1 AM weekdays and weekends. There's also been meeting invites for a 7:30 AM meeting, sent at 9 PM the previous day.
2.) Thermo underpays compared to industry standard, which contributes to long hiring times to find a replacement when someone leaves. A candidate is found, but then they take a higher paying offer at another company.
3.) Poor communication from management. A lot of times there were changes to the organization structure that were communicated last minute. 
4.) High turnover. There's some departments that have people there 10+ years and some 1-2 years, but nothing in between.
Advice to Management
Start paying competitively and hire more people. Some departments need their workforce doubled. Otherwise, you'll find yourself continuing to struggle to retain talent.

Work life balance does not exist and compensation is below market rate.
Advice to Management
If you are going to ""emphasize"" work/life balance then you should start at the top so that requests aren't trickling down resulting in late nights and weekends. Also, try to pay men and women equally - especially when it comes to bonus percentages, if they have the same experience and are in the same band, they should have the same bonus percentage.

2021-05-19, Quality Assurance,"Cambridge, MA","Former Employee, more than 1 year",Great company with poor leadership,"What I love about this company is the people I work with and our common mission to improve patients’ lives. TFS Cambridge has a lot of talented people imbedded in the fabric of the company’s heritage and strengths. Recognition is above average compared to most companies and company is generous with overtime if this is something you’re into. This is a great company to obtain experience in different aspect of the field within a short people of time.
","Remember how I said “overtime” and “obtain experience [...] within a short period of time” earlier? Well, there’s a downside to all that. The reason why you can make a good chunk of money (as an hourly employee) is due to the fact that there’s a huge lack of resources namely workforce. The hiring process takes about 2-3 months to get hired therefore the workload is always challenging since most employees have to wear different hats within their role. And spend long hours inside the lab if no one is available to relieve you.
These are minimal cons but I felt it’s important to let you know what you’re getting into.
The biggest cons of all time? Paid parking ($430/month and they reimburse $270), expensive health insurance and subpar base pay. Although the TFS claims their pay is competitive, they pay employees 15-20% under what other biotech companies pay for the same roles. They used to offer daily passes for people who drive to work and now the only people who get a monthly pass are upper management (day or night) and the staff working at night. If you work during the day and you’re not upper management, you’re doomed. One more thing to add: if you’re trying to be smart and save some money by switching to night which will give you a monthly parking pass in the blue garage, and a night differential of 15% (where most companies offer a 20+% night differential), it will take you months or they will just forget about you because they hire few people at a time and it takes 2-3 months before they operate on their respective 12-hr rotating shift (they will work Monday-Friday 9-5 for an additional 2 weeks before switching).
Advice to Management
Expedite the hiring process. I get that the goal is to hire talented individuals but if the hiring and onboarding process takes 2-3 months total + an additional 2 weeks for basic training, there’s no movement for people to switch to nights. Now, a lot of people want to switch to nights because they are not comfortable overpaying health insurance, parking with a pay lower than most biotech companies. Fix this...

2021-05-13, Scientist,"Eugene, OR",Former Employee,Great place to learn new skills but managers or not responsible and unorganized,"As a scientist you learn all sorts of techniques you can apply to your resume and there is a lot of knowledge in that site.
","Co-workers. Some co-workers were ancient and refused to change there ways with new guidelines and the managers were not confident enough to correct them. Speaking of managers, none of them were responsible, they would kick the can of responsibility down the chain and step on anyone to climb the corporate ladder. For a multi-billion dollar company they couldn't even purchase new equipment, we use ancient instruments to QC finished goods for customers using way more advanced machinery. I once asked if a piece of equipment that was broken could still be used for sterile techniques and the response was ""we don't have anther quality inspection for 10 months so we can use it for that long"". I loved doing the work it was just the people were the problems.
Advice to Management
Get more responsible people as managers, stop blaming other departments when things don't go as planned. Target the problem not the people. Your work instructions are all terrible, some are wrong and no one bothers to update them because they don't have the time so you should make time for that, the goal of the work instruction is to have someone new to the team be able to complete the procedure without crossing out items and adding new items in. Get a better inventory system and have planning communicate their needs better to the other departments.

","Expected to work extremely hard without much support from management. Management is generally incompetent, told to ""just make it work"" and ""this is just the way it is"" while process improvement worry only about their own metrics to increase their bonuses. People are treated as robots by management. Hopefully unique to this site, but haven't worked at any other sites.
Advice to Management
Treat people like human beings. Do not ""volunteer"" people for weekend work. Attempt to reduce the turnover rate as opposed to ""make it work.""

No training or proper explanations for what expectations are. Constant use of financial or product that are not explained or misunderstood by most.

Advice to Management
Stop being so lean. Hire people, not contingents so trained talent stays. When growing a business, each area must grow, not just the line. It’s the equivalent on building a huge housing development and shopping center with only one road in and out for all to use. Support departments/infrastructure néeds to go proportionally too. Many would give us a bonus to have better work/life balance.

2021-03-26, Manager,"Bridgewater, NJ","Former Employee, more than 8 years",Disappointing experience.,"Steady work and lots of overtime for hourly employees.
","Huge disconnect between lower levels where things happen to upper management. Management does not want to hear any bad news, just meet your numbers, so issues have escalated and magnified without a real effort to correct them.

We are a ""lean"" company, meaning everyone is overwhelmed. Couple this with a severe talent drain where most competent people leave in 6 -18 months you get a rapidly deteriorating condition. Most of the people who stay either are too lazy to look for another job or would not hack it elsewhere.

The personnel situation is so bad we can't get people for the production floor because the wages are too low compared to other jobs in the area, and management is spread so thin there is only one supervisor for four departments. There has been no department manager for a year. Plus most other companies do not work with dangerous chemicals.

Coming in I was told there were plenty of opportunities for advancement but reality is I am against a glass ceiling. Most positions from department manager on up are sourced outside. 

Procedures and work instructions are inaccurate or nonexistent in some departments.

Competent people are quickly overwhelmed by work and unsolvable issues then leave.
Substantial amounts of money are spent on 3rd party warehouses because the facility was not designed to handle the volume demanded from it. Production is in the same situation.

Continuity of management:
Eight facility managers in ten years.
Ten HR managers in eight years. HR is worthless anyway.
Four division leaders in five years.
Advice to Management
Get involved with your company and the people who work for you, particularly at the levels where money is made. And don't be afraid of making a real decision instead of leaving problems for your replacement in a year and a half. Who leaves it for their replacement, etc.

- the team knew how to work hard and play hard
","- the targets and metrics were challenging and not always conducive to maximising your own earning potential 
- same roles seemed to have quite wide variances in pay scale, therefore strong negotiation required

2021-03-24, Life Science Specialist,,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",A well-managed company that cares about it's employees,"It is very clear that Thermo Fisher Scientific values their employees. They take the yearly survey feedback seriously and are continually striving to make the company better for their customers and employees. The pay is good, the PTO is great and the COVID bonuses provided to all employees were more than generous. They set realistic budgets and goals that are attainable unlike previous companies I've worked for where they set your goal incredibly high to avoid having to pay bonuses/commissions. I am never worried about job stability and have coworkers and managers that I can trust and rely on. There is also a lot of opportunity to move around the company if you want.
","The company can be difficult to navigate due to its size. The health insurance plan is okay, although a bit expensive. This is offset by a generous contribution from the company into our HSA/HRA.
Advice to Management
I am so impressed by your decisions and management during the COVID pandemic. I saw many companies lay off their workforce or make deep cuts which drastically hurt many of my friends and family. You made strategic decisions to protect us during the uncertainty and then rewarded us when the pandemic boosted our numbers. That kind of investment in your employees speaks volumes and is why I give everything I have every day. I am proud to work for Thermo Fisher Scientific.

2021-03-24, Mechanical Engineer II,"Logan, UT","Current Employee, more than 3 years","Growing Fast, comes with growing pains","The company is growing quickly and has frequently given cash bonuses throughout the year depending on how the company is performing.
","Due to the rapid growth you feel the growing pains. It is very common to feel overworked/understaffed. Frequent organizational changes can be detrimental to progress. I had 3 different managers in a 1.5 year period (my job/responsibilities did not change) all due to organizational restructuring. This can make it difficult to get support and coaching from your manager(s).

Annual raises are poor. For consistent performers and very positive annual reviews you can expect a raise between 0.5% and 3%. I give their compensation adjustment system and its implementation a D + grade.
Advice to Management
Be more transparent about the metrics that are used for compensation decisions. In my experience they have been pretty arbitrary and rarely outpace normal inflation. This company is extremely profitable and all of its prices are adjusted with inflation annually. So annual compensation increases should at least match inflation. It is easy to improve profitability metrics when you increase prices based on inflation without also adjusting your employees compensation.

2021-03-13,Anonymous,"Saint Louis, MO","Former Employee, more than 3 years",It's OK,"Large company that's constantly growing through mergers and acquisitions means the corporation is very stable, your job is pretty safe.
More established divisions that have been under the Thermo umbrella for a longer time are more stable and the systems are more mature. Recently acquired or growing businesses will be rough around the edges.
You can gain experience with this company. There are growth opportunities for early career professionals.
","Compensation isn't competitive, you may start at an alright salary but target raises of 2% every year means you will fall behind quickly. If a manager has more than one good employer,annual raises become a very difficult subject with such a small pool to allovate. HR waits for employees to threaten to leave before considering adjusting salaries to market rates. This practice creates a culture where high performers are almost always considering leaving the company. You will have to be at least a director to receive stock as a compensation vehicle. Upper management turnover is low. Frontline and middle management turnover is high. 
Corporate benefits are about average, discretionary spending is on the stingier side (even directors don't get business class airfare for business travel).
The company has very little ""culture"", likely due to the corporate acquisition activity over the past 15 years. Thermo is generally more interested in growth than doing well in areas they already have business.
Thermo will outsource as much as possible, you will likely have to call a 1-800 for any kind of HR or IT support and wait several days for a response.
Later career professionals have limited growth potential, although there is an individual contributor career ladder, anything above Sr. Scientist is extremely rare so you will find people that are at the top of their pay band sooner or later.
Advice to Management
Slow down on the stock buybacks and reconsider compensation planning strategy. HR is a very top heavy part of the business with seemingly no accountability for employee satisfaction (upon reading this they would probably interview managers to see what they did wrong, act like there was an action plan in place and then hire another VP of HR and do nothing).

2021-03-06, Finance,"Pittsburgh, PA","Current Employee, more than 8 years","Finance talented, but very hard workplace to navigate","Great if you're young and have energy to put in hours of work. Easy to move at analyst levels among large sites, but very difficult to move around in some of the smaller sites as most areas require you to be in the office. The exception is the FLDP programs where they are supported financially with moving locations. The knowledge of finance at the Director level is great and they are willing to train their top performers. There are some really great people to work for in this organization. Networking and mentoring although highly encouraged for job growth can still be awkward at times. Finding personal advocates is even more difficult for advancing careers.
","Up or out culture for management or leadership with pre-planned strategies already set for rotating employees. Really bad HR issues in Pittsburgh that are ignored or not supported including harassments, diversity & inclusion, supporting family or health situations. However, I believe HR is attempting to improve. Constant position banding changes that have not been a positive experience for many of the personnel. Finance specifically encourages people to rotate every two years, there is no stability in positions. Reorganizations and responsibilities change constantly occur to a point where performance reviews are impacted. The Pittsburgh finance teams have tighter budgets that usually do not allow for frequent resource increases nor for travel with business partners.
Advice to Management
You lose top performers constantly to some of the items pointed out in the Cons section. One negative comment or situation can ruin someone's reputation. Provide people the benefit of the doubt by looking for a single instance vs repetitive behaviors especially when requesting employees to work more than 50 hrs per week in a high stress environment. Learn to coach them to a better place and you will be able to retain better talent as well as have a much healthier workplace. Support those individuals going through life changes as they'll be more dedicated and loyal. Please also work on a zero tolerance or even a strikes policy for all complaints in some of your more serious HR related issues regardless of rank or work responsibilities. Your people need to be more supported.

","Thermo pays much lower than the industry standard. They pile on more and more responsibilities without any change in pay. If you want to learn more technical skills or get a promotion? Someone else has to leave. There’s constant pressure from planners and management to meet tight deadlines. There is a revolving door of talent due to this. There is an expectation to work OT everyday and Saturdays. Work/life balance is terrible. Career growth is stunted/discouraged by management.

","Organized bullying, sexual harassment and false sexual harassment allegations in the form of malicious gossip used as a weapon are out of control in Carlsbad. They're led by both men and women. Management and human resources are not your friend. Their real job functions are to hide the disaster occurring below the scenes, and the easiest way to do this is to further punish the victims by forcing them out of the company in one way or another. It's rampant.
Advice to Management
The company exists to make money. Fine. But there are people of all levels in Carlsbad that are costing the company hundreds of millions of dollars as they bring their sociopathy and covert narcissism into the workplace. No exaggeration.

","o Their only action during the first month of the pandemic was to provide every employee with a letter from management designating them as essential personnel and eliminating any acceptable excuse for them to miss work.
o No masks were provided to any employees until weeks after the first positive case in the facility. When management announced the first positive case in the facility, it was done in an area of the warehouse where social distancing was impossible. Until that point morning stretches had been held in the same area. 
o Management informed employees at a facility-wide meeting that hand sanitizer would not prevent the spread of the virus (the accuracy of which is up for debate), in their mind presumably excusing the fact that there was almost none available in the entire facility (until several weeks after numerous positive cases in the facility).
o Despite emails sent by management assuring that cleaning supplies would be readily available to every employee, none were made available. I was at no time made aware of the location of, or witnessed anyone using, cleaning supplies to wipe down equipment that was used by multiple employees in numerous departments every day. 
o Despite emails sent by management assuring employees that all workspaces in the facility would be cleaned on a daily basis, entire areas were not cleaned for weeks, if at all. 
o Employees were still expected to work in crowded conditions for 50-60 hour (mandatory) weeks after positive cases began accumulating in the facility. 
o Employees who were responsible and (despite no encouragement from management) were tested for COVID-19 (and tested positive) were granted short term disability at a reduced rate from their normal salary. Those who exhibited symptoms but were never tested were compensated for their time missed with a normal 40 hours. 
o Employees returning from time missed due to COVID-19 were not approached by management to welcome them back and ask how they were feeling; it was just another day.
o When the pandemic was in full force management began lecturing employees to practice social distancing (despite the fact it was physically impossible if the goal was to actually complete your work), while not utilizing it themselves.

The work is not physical as much as it is more about using your mind and hands. Raises according to your performance. Company hands you a check for a turkey every November. A lot of elderly female and male employees.
","It may be, in a lot of ways, a safe place to work. But, they still have a long way to go to completely protect their employees from unknowingly getting sick from exposure to the clinical trial drugs that people expose themselves to. Favoritism is a thing here from supervisors down as far as I could tell, if they don’t like you, primary workers will run you out, or shut you out. They like to periodically edit your job title duties by adding responsibility, with or without your consent. And not to mention will not compensate you for those added responsibilities. Supervision can be very gun-ho yet that goes for a-lot of people here. And I speak especially of those who work in Primary. Cut pay instead of raise it when COVIID hit this only effected Supervision and up.
Advice to Management
Listen to your employees when they raise concerns. Provide better and longer coaching to Room Leaders and Tech IIIs. Quit adding responsibilities to your people without offering a a form of compensation. Aside from the compensation that they have already earned.

","They are not shy about telling you that your job is only there from quarter to quarter if you make your numbers. Miss two quarters in a row as a business unit and employees are easily dismissed with ""restructures"", regardless of tenure. While benefits are second to none, compensation is not in line with market and annual merit increases are minimal at best. Make sure to negotiate strong when you start, for not only compensation but vacation time and banding.

Say ""yes"" to new Quality hires. Say ""no"" to the client sometimes. build a stable environment for the employees. invest in a collective project management system asap.

Advice to Management
The current introduction manual is not useful at all, in my time there I didn't use anything from it. I had to learn everything from other employees who took the time to show me things instead, a lot of procedures were not explained. Rather than explaining cleaning, I think a manual about packaging direction would be more useful. For instance, talking about how stickers must be placed specifically according to instructions provided and how checks must be performed by QA's after a round of preparation. These are all things older members taught me, without them I would have not understood anything.

Management tends to brush problems under the rug, does not provide positive feedback and everyone is in constant fear of being laid off or fired. It has a very ""protect yourself"" sort of vibe, where everyone seems to be just trying to protect themselves rather than help each other, which leads to a lot of finger pointing and a less than harmonious environment.

I was also lucky enough to do quite a lot of travel around Europe helping the events team, and there was a lot of encouragement to develop and grow within the team, unfortunately it was only to management which is something I wasn't keen on. The people there are great to work and socialise with and a there is a relaxed atmosphere in general.
","The business is full of snakes, nobody wants to make a decision and things take forever to get completed. There is a lot of sucking up and the people on the ground don't have a voice and have to follow the leaders unconditionally. Until you sell your soul and make it into senior level you're just another number, and there are very few people that get into the senior positions that do it off their own merit or experience, it's more about who you know and what impression you've made on the big wigs.
Advice to Management
Just because someone is in a senior position, it doesn't mean they know what is best, and a lot of the time they don't know what they are talking about. Listen to the people doing the leg work as they know first hand what does and doesn't work from their own experience.

2020-12-05, Finance Employee,"Woodlands New Town,","Former Employee, more than 3 years",Seriously Reconsider Joining Finance Team,"Starting pay for fresh grad ok, people lower than senior management level are nice to work with, potential high exposure to multiple ERP systems, benefits ok, product created helps mankind, potential exposure to tasks beyond your department, challenging and fast paced environment, exposure to international people as it is an MNC.
","Senior management don't seem to care that at least 1 finance employee has left the organization since December 2019. Even HR does not seem to care despite this issue being brought up to them. Don't appreciate current staff but when they leave, usually they are replaced with higher level personnel, or suddenly we cannot hire a replacement headcount and the overworked team needs to cover for said person who left. Keep looking to cut headcount without understanding the nature of the work people are doing. Only hear what they want to hear and don't accept the truth if it is not aligned with what they want (e.g. teams are not working enough hours despite the team clearly working over time even before COVID. Extremely political and toxic environment to work in. Difficult career mobility upwards because senior management only like managerial level people instead of people who can do the day-to-day work, and their high and unobtainable expectations of lower level staff just to move up 1 measly level. Stress can be so bad that employee health is jeopardized.
Advice to Management
To the corporate team - take a hard look at what is going on. Don't rely on the local management team to fix this, the team has lost trust in them. Just ask any of the other international teams who have had to deal with the Singapore team how difficult it has been trying to work with the team now. 

To the local management team - If you keep this up and don't care about the team and their wellbeing and refuse to listen to what you do not want to hear, you will continue to see more people leave. You can attempt to foster ""kinship"" by making the teams return to the office. You may try to act nice to those who remain. But there is no point conducting interviews when you've lost the trust of the people, and everyone can smell from a mile away that you're just being nice so that you may find out who is the next person to quit. It does not work to promise a promotion and salary increase only when a person has tendered their resignation. 

Stop being a yes-man to all requests thrown from upper management at the detriment of those who have to do the work.

Business Outlook
Pros
Conscientious leadership, excellent corporate resources for employees, highly collaborative environment, internal job-seeking encouraged, Health benefits extraordinary for some chronic diseases. Lives its mission to make the world cleaner, healthier, and safer. CEO leads the company in a unique way, where everyone bands together in times of economic turmoil to avoid job loss and if you hang in you are rewarded in the long-run.
Cons
Generally, benefits are middle of the road in every aspect. The constant movement of/within departments means there is always at least 1 man down on a team, often more. Promotions are rare, interviewing for another role is the best way to get ahead, but it can be very competitive. Information flows top-down so having a good manager who is transparent is critical to your success.

2020-10-28, Quality Specialist III,"Detroit, MI","Current Employee, more than 5 years",Proactive Professional Top Down Discussions of Race In America Welcome,"Riots surrounding George Floyd this summer prompted a management response that has revolutionized Thermo Fisher's external commitment to ending discrimination. Management has stepped up its game in ways that are not placation. There has been a truly pivotal and dynamic shift in the inclusiveness and welcoming nature of discussion and understanding within company social media. 

It has led me to being proud to work for this company after multiple years of thinking that they were ""just another big company that doesn't care"". 

IT department has a core structure of dedicated, qualified individuals working together to support common goals.

Annual employee feedback survey is actually taken to heart by management and I have seen improvement based on feedback year over year.

Job Stability During COVID. My team is global, so I already worked remotely.
","Promotions difficult depending on department. Lots of opportunities to move internally does generally move problem co-workers out of their current position. If you like your department, your boss will have to fight to get you promoted.

Like any job, your boss will determine if you like your position or not. This is the first year that I've had the same boss from goal setting to goal review (1 year), making it insanely hard to get promoted.

Unclear why some executives are on a fast track when they don't understand their divisions well.
Advice to Management
Continue to be proactive in bias training & commitments to diversity hires. 

Do more to recognize & review employees who have been here for 3+ years to see if their managers who keep moving are stopping them from getting promoted. 

Have a larger commitment to controlled documentation training, especially to preserve tribal knowledge. 

Employ more women in higher management positions/senior staff.

","There is more of an emphasis on maintaining the status quo than on innovation (which is supposedly one of their core ""values"" but it is never practiced). The Practical Process Improvement (PPI) initiative is based on decades-old Total Quality Management (TQM) concepts and I did everything I could to upgrade the company to Lean. However, I was fought at every turn for telling the truth about PPI's limitations and trying to make real improvements.
Advice to Management
Immediately scrap PPI and implement Lean using outside experts (no one I met there besides me had any real understanding of Lean or even basic tenets of process improvement). Redo your metrics to support the Lean effort (the experts will tell you what they are). 
Fix your Ethics program to actually work - which means don't use your own HR department to investigate/determine ethics violations because they will never find any as their job focus is to protect senior management from workers/whistleblowers who report ethical lapses by them. These are the two main reasons why I left and I know many others who left because of the toxic work environment. 
Also, you need to be more concerned about putting people in leadership positions that actually have the talent and ability to do the job than just trying to improve diversity to win awards. Applaud the push to improve diversity but the people need to also know how to do the jobs for which they are hired. Last two directors were complete disasters with no leadership skills or relevant knowledge/background in the field of process improvement.

2020-10-19, Sales,Sydney,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",Toxic/Chaotic working place,"Colleagues were the only good thing.
","- Not every manager is a leader.
- the company’s motto “helping customer to enable to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer” does not apply to ANZ business. Only few people take this vision statement to heart and all others are after sales funnel and targets.
If targets are not met, managers put you on PIP without giving warning.
- every individual learn at different pace, especially for someone who just started the role/ new to the industry. This is not a company for a graduate because they do not have effective training programs that cater to graduates and people who are new to the industry.
- if you are looking to work in a pressure built environment , this is the perfect job but if you are looking to grow into the role please do not apply to this company. They will look at the numbers. Employees are just numbers.
- the human resource is also very biased; they only listen to the management. So do not waste time talking to anyone, they don’t listen instead they blame you for complaining. 
- They do not train you on the analytics programs and database; they expect you to learn it on your own on your time. 
- The company makes you feel alone and gossips make it very toxic environment to work.
- they presume that the pay they give you compensates for the pressures but NO it does not.

In short don’t work for this company. It’s just a pressure cooker where managers use micro managing, intimidation to get the work done.
Advice to Management
Not every manager is a leader. Human Resources should not be biased and should listen to anyone without judgement.

I presume that they think that if they have you traveling 100% of the time, then maybe they think that at least they can be a little generous with expenses?
","100% ridiculous amount of travel. They preach work-life balance but have no problem having you travel 7 days a week. Your time/life is at their disposal.
Advice to Management
Practice what you preach; say as you do, then do as you say. Management would say that they'd never put you in certain situations, but then turn right around and assign you to those tasks they said they'd never put you in - and then reprimand you for trying your best (but invariably coming up short). They would instruct you to always keep them informed; however when matters would arise that require immediate attention/decision (as they always do in field service), management would get around to replying to you 3-4 days later when you originally needed a decision in 3-4 minutes. Thermo epitomizes the adage that they set you up to fail time and time again. I left Thermo before having secured another job because I was so miserable - as is this company.

- Our pay is reasonable, comparable roles at a lot of competitors are a 1-4 grand less.

- Plenty of training to finish, there are always new things to do and learn if you start to get bored with your current work.

- Our days are consistently busy, you aren't drowning in work but you have more than enough to keep you engaged, the majority of my days fly by. No need for clock watching!
","Some of the work is easy but long-winded. If you're looking for more mentally engaging/complex work that will require troubleshooting then you'll need to have 1-2 years experience under your belt before you can progress into those types of roles.

","Highly political. They preach ""one team"" but act as anything but. Sr. leadership is self-absorbed looking out for themselves and care little for the front-line employees. Unless you started your career there, I would not recommend anyone seeking a position at Thermo Fisher Scientific. You will be an outside and thrown under the bus at the first convenient opportunity.

2020-05-23," Staff Scientist, Product Manager","Carlsbad, CA","Former Employee, more than 5 years","Growing Company, Poorly Integrated, Dysfunctional, Slow at Execution","- Fantastic 401K match and the vesting period is short compared with competitors
- Great resources (ability to get lab supplies at or near cost)
- Company hosts many exciting events and workshops throughout the year and are great opportunities to gain skills or volunteer
- Company is very lean, and is heavily focused on data metrics and KPIs, I really appreciated the focus on continuous improvement
- The education scholarship is generous, albeit more restrictive compared with other employers
- Healthcare offerings are variable depending on the group and region, some pre-merger legacy plans that Thermo has retained are truly unmatched
- Company has a relatively young, vibrant workforce and is growing
- On-site amenities, including gym and cafeteria (where available) are cheap and accessible
- WFH flexibility is great if you get the right manager and department
","- PTO policy, though on the surface fairly generous at 3 weeks starting, is inflexible and difficult to navigate in my experience compared with competitors (example: maternity leave)
- The company is an agglomeration of a number of smaller companies that were the product of Thermo's buying binge over the past couple of years. There remains quite a bit of overlap and silos that result in unnecessary duplication of functions and resources, territory disputes, office politics, and communication challenges. Except for a very few functions, expect to be frustrated by this on a regular basis.
- Advancement opportunities are lacking and raises are paltry compared with competitors. The company does emphasize ""lateral moves"" into other roles, which I appreciatively took advantage of during my career at Thermo Fisher. However, in my own experience many times this resulted in others coming in who were completely unfamiliar with a product line that took on a management or oversight role where they have no clear idea what the product really is, how it is used, or how it is manufactured. It is also exhausting to have to re-introduce yourself to your new manager and to justify your existence and importance to the team if you're doing it 3-4 times a year.
- The websites are truly an absolute dumpster fire and the company has no easy solutions to address it. It is difficult to get a customer interested in a product when they themselves cannot find it on the website.
- Constant instability, turnover, layoffs that weren’t fully thought through, and unrealistic expectations. As a result, there was frequently a lot of friction and resulting drama between on-site employees or underhanded tactics from mid-level managers that subsequently amplified the drama and hampered productivity (i.e. artificially inflating numbers, stealing resources and materials from other groups in the middle of the night to ""hold down the budget"").
- The open-plan office space and dearth of conference and huddle rooms at many larger sites make it logistically difficult to schedule and hold meetings
- Many of the Senior Directors and VP's seem to have an almost ""Cult of Personality"" problem. While Thermo Fisher has a top-notch Internal Communications and PR Shop, the focus on AV, bright lights, and showmanship versus more open, honest dialogue and communication results in it being an uninformative pablum. Why does there need to be a DJ and produced light show at a site's quarterly Town Hall discussing company performance? Isn't that a bit excessive? Why does the Leadership and Marketing Teams need to frequently come in and disrupt the lab operation to ""play act"" science for the camera? If you have a question or concern regarding a decision being rolled out from the top, do not expect a speedy or satisfying answer, or even a forum to gain further clarity
- I did experience the ultimate insult of finding out I was about to be laid off but before that was going to happen, I was asked to train my replacement on another continent.
Advice to Management
It is imperative that Thermo Fisher starts adhering to and complying with labor laws regarding safety and rest breaks for hourly workers, something they are (still) continuing to struggle with at some of the California and Oregon sites. The lack of competence, training, and compliance for some managers and supervisors overseeing hourly employees is, at best, inconsistent across groups, and at worst, negligent. This behavior is unacceptable, it is not building trust with the hourly workforce, and is bound to lead to additional legal action (yes, they have a history). Better HR and EHS infrastructure is needed.

Please do a better job of removing barriers to execution that are slowing down innovation and quality! TFS customers are doing incredibly important work and need those products, if there are issues affecting the quality, efficacy, or integrity of products, these must be addressed by management in a rapid, comprehensive, and meaningful way. Slow-walking or being opaque about an issue because a process must be followed or a sales goal needs to be hit are not acceptable and damages the company's reputation.

2020-05-19, Software Developer,"Pittsburgh, PA","Former Employee, more than 8 years","Employees are just resources, not people. Big-company mgmt mentality.","Stable company, cafe in Pittsburgh HQ
","Management tends to treat employees as nothing more than skill sets, instead of valuing each person for their domain knowledge. There is no company loyalty to the employee, despite employee loyalty and longevity. Internal reorganizations left people in positions where they were not optimally placed, nor happy with the new (forced) position duties. They will not hesitate to then ding them for slower performance and kick them out the door, regardless of how successful they were in previous positions or projects. It felt like the old ""underhanded layoff"" technique that is common in corporate America.
Advice to Management
Return to a mindset where people are seen as humans first, skill sets second. Reward their loyalty with loyalty to them. Ensure each middle-manager holds these values first and foremost, instead of letting them ruin people's retirements and career growth with their ill-informed decisions to terminate otherwise valuable employees simply because their current project isn't a good fit for them, especially if it was forced upon them. It's understandable that contractors may be let go when projects are completed, but this approach should never apply to permanent folk, and yet I witnessed it first-hand on numerous occasions.

","Heavy handed management. Managers who do not realize that their people make or break them and so, they should at least do a good job of pretending to care and to support their employees. Expected to complete paperwork and admin tasks on your own time. Too big and bureaucratic.
Advice to Management
During the interview process, when asked about policies such as overtime and company car, do be mealy-mouthed. Do not so overburden managers that they cannot focus on taking care of their reports. Yes, I understand it's a for profit business. When communicating unpleasant news, the manager should own it and not blame superiors or use statements like ""upper management is watching."" Do not make statements like: ""well, that's how we always had to do it when I was an FSE.""

","1) Pay is low compared to its competitors, especially when you divide the pay by the long work hours. 
2) Toxic work environment. No respect for talents. This company is an incubator for work bullies. The real talents either got demoted, or pushed away, because they don't fit in the company vibe. Therefore, if you are a kind person -- be careful, this is not a company for you. 
3) Extremely long work hours. The management expects you to stand-by all the time. One mid-night call and you need to get up and work. No subsidy for overtime work. 
4) Mediocre middle management. Always say Yes to their bosses, very often over promise on deadlines, no matter how ridiculous the request is. Push the employees to work on nights and weekends to make the overpromised deadlines.

","Management need to work big time on keeping employees who are great & committed to the company. 
Invest time in proper training.
High staff turn over
Unrealistic expectations 
Felt as though there are set rules for particular sections compared to others.
Investigate issues properly with evidence instead of here-say.
When employees approach management they push blame on others
Management only held people accountable when it suited them
Clique mentality, if you didn't fit in you weren't thought of.
No career development 
HR are very unprofessional,
Turning a blind eye if it meant more work for them.
Updating policies after serious incidents happening to cover themselves
Sacking people is their forte! 
8 people in a month! Many being fabulous workers!
I absolutely loved my job, I put in so much hard work & suggestions for money saving and production process. but it has completely gone down hill since management ejected 2 employees at once who kept the whole place in line. Now it's being run into the ground.
Advice to Management
Commit to giving your loyal, hard working employees better training to develop skills instead of turning over multiple employees who need more time for training new skills.
Give employees the respect and chance to be heard.

2020-02-18, Senior Financial Analyst,,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",Great Company - Could be better,"Company offers a pretty good 401k plan with 6% match, WFH opportunity depending on manger, 15 days PTO (no sick time though), 3 floating holidays, 5% discount ESPP, very good tuition reimbursement, 4%-8% performance bonus (recently added) and pretty good benefits offered through Cigna. This is a great company that has had some great growth from an investment standpoint in recent years and is expected to continue growth in the long term plan. Not many days that you are expected to work over 8 hours, but occasionally this does happen.
","The organization is very stingy with raises from what I have experienced. Been at the organization some time now and haven't gotten a raise since I started. Definitely something to consider when negotiating salary in the hiring process. The company also has very convoluted data that is very difficult to work with, not much standardization in regards to how to handle the data to ensure accuracy of reporting. A lot of communication is done through conference calls and there are a lot of fire drills that need to be handled on a day to day basis (this is common anywhere when working with sales people). Management needs to understand the jobs that the employees are faced with better and work on developing employees on a higher level training. Onboarding seems to be low level and doesn't really help since most issues are relatively complex. Sales Directors pretty much run the show at this company and at times ask for some really complex reports that could be simplified or standardized if the company would upgrade some of their internal business systems. Seems like there are a lot of job postings but not much internal movement. Company likes to bring in a lot of people from outside and keep people in their current roles.
Advice to Management
Get rid of the performance review process or make some changes to align with the organization to maintain costs. Stop digging for ways to not give current employees annual raises when the jobs being asked of these employees are not structured very well from an employee onboarding/training process. There is a lot of turnover at the organization due to the lack of culture and difficulty to manage data. Reward your employees for hard work and you might see people stay around longer. Also, invest some money in better systems to get away from so much ad-hoc analysis. Obviously in a senior position there will always be ad-hoc but from my experience 75% of the job is done from scratch and if methodology does not align with what the sales team is looking for it creates a ton of re-work.

","Career development doesn't exist. I am with the company for more than seven years. In those seven years, I have seen mid level management positions vacated 9 times, and 8 of them were filled with external candidates. This is only in one department. That is 11% chance for a mid level manager to be filled by an internal candidate in seven years. This is very good for outside candidates, terrible for company employees. Company is busy educating outside hires and ended up losing be them eventually as well.
Advice to Management
Develop your high potential employees. Employees should be given high priority for career advancement instead of hiring from outside. The loss of knowledge and technical know-how is real and not sustainable. Frequent hiring from outside candidates are demoralizing. That means someone like me will have to rebuild my reputation over and over again to prove myself to the new management. Now I am at the point that I am starting to ask myself why. Why should I even try to be a high performer, given that my career path is leading toward a dead end.

2019-12-06,,,Current Employee,Analyst,"If you stay long enough, you are able to apply internally and move around to different roles since the company is large. The team you work with are usually hard workers.
","Politics, average pay, long hours and cold environment where people are treated like numbers. They think constantly moving around and changing things up (even when it’s not progress) is a good thing which often creates extra unnecessary work. They seem to have a retention issue. I think it’s because there’s really not much they offer that is above the market to motivate employees. There are people who are overpaid and barely do anything and the work gets shoved to a few. There’s not even the cool factor, fun environment or perks to alleviate some of the stress associated with long hours and often unrealistic deadlines. A company like this shouldn’t act top notch if what they offer is average at best. Talent is retained through more than just a steady income. Employees need to feel proud of the company they work for, feel valued, and actually enjoy the environment.
Advice to Management
Kick the lazy unproductive workers out, reward the hard workers. Stop the politics and reorient the focus to just work and getting things accomplished.

2019-11-20,,,Current Employee,Bland corporate culture with a declining employee experience,"This organization is very large with mildly successful vertical integration. Headcount is adequate or close to it. Corporate is willing to invest in site operation expansion. With continuous growth there are opportunities for promotion.
","Corporate doesn't seem interested in investing to provide adequate office space for employees when staffing new operations expansions. Employee retention is not given much priority. Office spaces are continually remodeled to cram more people into the same space. The company has little to no culture. Aside from the close proximity to your coworkers, the office spaces feel very ""sterile"". This is a bland company to work for. 

Salary and benefits are below average. You cannot roll over any PTO into the following year which seems like a tacky way for them to get deferred expenses off the books at EOY.

HR and IT are primarily outsourced so your local HR and IT resources will be overloaded. Corporate HR seems to only think about the remote sites once or twice a year.

2019-10-22, Staff Scientist,,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Great brand, subpar culture","As with many biotech companies, your group, your manager, and your manager's manager will largely influence your (perceived) career trajectory and enjoyment. Fortunately, I've had two great managers so far, so my experience has been largely good. In my experience, the pros have been:
- Great people to work with. Most, if not all people in immediate surroundings work hard and carry their weight. 
- If you take initiative, you'll get plenty of opportunity to grow. 
- Drama is fairly minimal at the pre-managerial level.
- Stable job
- Technical teams are pretty lean
- Free coffee. You're gonna need it.
","- Below average compensation. Annual salary growth is almost non-existent unless your position changes. 
- Employee retention is starting to dip.
- Many mandatory corporate-wide paperwork/training/assessments
- Many experienced technical employees refuse to take managerial roles, probably for a good reason...
- Pushing for change is slow in a big corporation, unsurprisingly.
- Career advancement is slow on average.
- Short-term (usually revenue-driven) goals eclipse the priority of investing in long-term process improvements.
Advice to Management
- Great managers REALLY need to be awarded more. They can make a big difference in retention, efficiency, employee growth and general satisfaction.
- Everyone is too busy to make PPI changes. Give your employees some dedicated time to make process improvements.
- Upper management should take time and listen to feedback from lower technical employees.

","-absolutely zero room for career advancement unless you are one of the manager's ""favorites"" - managers will block applications to other departments or find ways to tell you you're unqualified
-daily expectations exceed department capabilities (i.e. running skeleton crew and being expected to produce as much product as 2-3x the current labor force could provide)
-managers do not care at all about employee's well-being, we are merely the means to an end (i.e. ""I don't care, just get it done"" type of attitude)
-excessive OT leading to burnout, management sees no problem in losing staff due to this but refuses to train or hire new people
-profits over people is the Thermo Fisher way. get used to having suggestions ignored or downright dismissed right to your face.
-morale is near zero due to the promise of *temporary* 10 hour minimum days and occasional weekend work that turned into 6 months straight of 50+ hour weeks and a half dozen mandatory Saturdays (and counting!)
-HUGE disconnect between office workers and lab workers, the people who sit at their desk all day have absolutely no clue what we go through back in the labs (although in their fairness, we have no idea how hard it is to send emails and go to meetings all day either).
-the HVAC system is a total joke. the office area is nice and climate controlled but the labs used to be a warehouse - there is no insulation or thermostats. facilities literally has to climb inside the ceilings to open or close the vents in order to let in more or less heat or AC. some rooms are 79 degrees F, some rooms are 58 degrees F. again, management says it's not a problem and we're just going to have to deal with it.
-for a $21 BILLION corporation, you'd think they could afford to properly compensate their employees but salaries are a JOKE compared to similar jobs in the surrounding area (like 25-50% less!) 
-HR is not helpful, mostly because there's only 1 person and she's got hundreds of employees to deal with so basically unless it's extremely urgent she's never going to reply.
-I could go on for days...I know I'm missing something
Advice to Management
wake up and start paying attention to your employee's needs! that means you actually have to get your butt out of your cushy chair, walk out of your nice air-conditioned office, gown up, and head back to the labs in order to talk with us about problems that need fixing.

2019-09-05, Field Service Engineer,,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",Upper management needed. Not a bad alternative to unemployment.,"Good salary/benefits. Regional managers and team are mostly excellent.
","1. Management. Since the turn of the year upper management has been forcing more and more paperwork down our throats. It is to the point where we spend 30% of our time at a computer. The software is miserable and dysfunctional. After lots of problems and complaints, upper management decided to release a service pack to make it more time consuming rather than fix the bugs and time waste.
2. No Communication. The company has had multiple logistics nightmares this year in which the regional managers were not informed until their engineers started complaining. Chronically short staffed and customers of course take this out on engineers.
3. Completely disorganized company. You can not believe the disorganization and dysfunction. We have had lots of engineers from other large corporations come over and be shocked at how ridiculous it is. New employees take 6-9 months to start training and contributing, unless they quit first.
4. Morale. Morale is so low at this point that there will be large employee turnover. Only ones that will stay will be the ones that don't do much and like that they can get away with it.

They make an effort to provide a comfortable environment (decent cafeteria food and fitness centers) and show appreciation with events like BBQ's a few times per year and a nice holiday party (which was moved to Jan/Feb. I guess they want to save $ and not offend anyone?).
","It's a huge company so you may not feel a sense of community. Profit is the bottom line. I saw changes that definitely didn't benefit customers and made day-to-day work more challenging for employees. Thermo Fisher acquires companies at a fast clip. You may be realigned out of a job or suffer in an understaffed situation. Growth & opportunities may be limited because job categories are pretty segregated by region/Country.

-spend a lot of time training staff 
-wants employees to understand the business 
-good corporate culture where harmful interpersonal conflicts/bullying isn't tolerated
-every day you learn something about the products and the business
-B2B environment so 99.9% of customers are polite even when stressed
","-on the customer service side, it's stressful 
-slow to change policies and adapt procedures
-long hours on the phone mean little movement from desk resulting in back backs, sore shoulders, and sore ears (always, always on the phone) 
-say they hire internally but a lot of excellent people got overlooked for promotions in favour of outsiders 
-you need to handle continual stress from high workload to stay at this job for more than 1-2 years. The customers are nice. Management is friendly. It's the workload and workflow that drain/burn out the customer service reps.
Advice to Management
-work to reduce the stress on customer service representatives
-work to upgrade computer systems 
-work on changing up daily routines so people aren't 100% on the phone. Good for a mental break. Good to give the ears a break too.

Decent sales training and co-workers are generally nice people and are supportive as a team.
","Typical corporate-style management only cares about quotas and their bonuses. 
Expect you to talk to customers during business hours and expect you to work all evening on all follow-up office work. We are expected to be efficient with an extremely archaic and non-functioning CRM system that frequently crashes. Internal pricing teams and customer care are spread thin and overwhelmed with the demand of customers and orders. Management expects us, Account Managers, to be experts on thousands of products yet offer no training. There is a Technical Sales Specialist to work with but again are spread so thin we rarely get to work together effectively. 
Overall the company is too cheap to invest in internal updates to make our jobs easier and more effective yet they expect double-digit growth for each territory. 
Not a good place for diversity and do not understand other cultures and personalities that are not typical white American.
Advice to Management
Go into the field and interact with a customer, not every customer wants to buy every single thing from us. It is not really working in our favor to pressure us to sell everything. Customers tend to be standoffish when we mention the Thermo Fisher name due to the size of the company and the negative connotations of large companies. They really think we are the WalMart of science and not really helping with customer loyalty. 

Invest in your internal business processes because everything is so inefficient.

","Intensity is a scary word there
Work Life balance is fake, certain people only
No fairness, only favoritism. You can do no wrong if management likes you. If you are not in that inner circle, just be ready to take all the blames even it's not your fault.
Racism heavily exists. Only one race will be promoted. They might put minority to unimportant spot occasionally just to show diversity, but never something meaningful position. If you are minority, female, colorful race or has foreign accent, you need to be quiet and obey, then you might have a chance.
Full of toxic culture. Few people will purposely speaking on phone so loud in open office space, so they can get attention from top. Also you will see few female employees constantly go to male director/VP's office to discuss ""works"" with door closed.
Backstabbing is real. This place doesn't care about your performance. Only what people say about you in the back matters. Be careful if you are smart and hard working, your manager and colleagues will not like it and they will try to take you down if you show too much ego. 
Finance system is just a disaster. You will be put into the place to create financial report with wrong data all the time. Watch out these people can talk intelligently about the system and data, they are the person with no clue but only really good in BS. But for some reasons, this company loves bs.
No job security. Be expected to look for new job every 1-2 years. They don't want you to stay at the same role too long. You need to go through the same interview process every 1-2 years competing with another 5 external candidates. That's their method to push out people they don't like without paying severance. 

If you are about to accept their offer but have another opportunity in hand, think twice. Make sure you know what environment you will get yourself into.

Remember it is the employees that made you successful. Need at least one member of the CLT to be balanced and comfortable with people and more importantly knows how to inspire.

2019-06-19, Senior Executive Assistant,"Waltham, MA",Current Employee,Executive Assistant...worst company I’ve ever worked for!! RUN!!,"Great parking, good pay! Great cafeteria. New building.
","• If you enjoy being part of a group of catty gossipy admin women, then this is the company for you. People say you get that anywhere you work, but nope I’ve never witnessed it quite like here!
• the upper management, or “4th floor” employees, are extremely rude, act well above others, and closed to new ideas.
• their only goal is to acquire as many smaller companies, to make as much money as they can - which I’m sure is the end goal for many businesses, but the over matrixed environment (the many companies rolled into one) makes working there unjustifiably insane.
• there is NO work/life balance
• HR is bias and not at all supportive if there is an issue with management. I have seen this work against people in many situations.
• CEO is one of the most over paid CEO in MA, and the BOD are pissed! Look it up, public knowledge. Greedy!
Advice to Management
Your HR group is horrendous!!! From the business partners, to the hiring process! I’ve never witnessed anything more unprofessional in my working career.
I helped interview executive assistant candidates, and then heard nothing but “unrelated” reasons why they weren’t a good fit for the job! Made me embarrassed to think that’s the hiring process I was once a part of. Shameful!

","The pay is exceedingly low for Silicon Valley. If you're not an exec or, possibly, in sales, I hope you have a spouse with a high-paying job or have other income otherwise you'll struggle to afford the average rent here. 

There are few opportunities for advancement within the company. Though training is sometimes available for other areas as a means for advancement, the company rarely follows through on the advancement part. There are large groups of employees stuck in low-paying, go-nowhere jobs.

Management turnover is high. There are frequent power struggles among departments and communication is often poor.
Advice to Management
Pay your people an *actual living wage* for the area. The company makes, what, $1b a quarter now? You can afford it. This isn't some bootstrapped startup.

","Don’t work in Manufacturing. Very poor work life balance with minimal tolerance for errors. Expectations are impossible to achieve without compromising stress. Working extremely hard results in little or no recognition. Management only cares about money, and leads/supervisors show no appreciation for hard work. Company events and extracurricular activities are impossible to attend without impacting production and consequently getting reprimanded. 

Additionally, upper management only focuses on high level issues, regardless of the impact they have on the floor. When operators try to provide feedback, their ideas are met with no cooperative efforts. Many of the supervisors and leads will talk poorly about their employees behind their backs as well. Trust nobody. I would recommend avoiding this department as a whole.

","Former Life Technologies arm of the business could be more progressive in terms of attitudes to part-time and flexible working. Legacy Thermo Fisher Scientific business is better from this perspective albeit less ""modern"" in a number of other areas.

Employer branding needs investment.
Paisley site canteen and cafe facilities need to be brought up to date (food offering is very old-fashioned and low quality)
Matrix model means too many projects at once in the Global Operations side leading to confused priorities. Can lead to stress and staffing resources in some Ops functions being stretched too thin and deadlines being missed and/or quality of project delivery suffering.

","I was fired and I don't know why. I had a great boss and my department was really great. I received a call one Friday night saying that my assignment was suddenly ended because of some complaints from a rival department. I was completely blindsided and didn't receive any feedback other than that I was out of a job. All I know is that I did my job as best as I could and some angry young people who don't know me and never talked to me didn't like me and formed a coup to get me fired. It makes me sad that people lead with their anger and form judgments of others rather than taking the time to get to know people their own age.

More like advice to HR - improve your process and communicate with people. If someone had talked to me I could've worked out whatever the issues were (and talked to my boss), but I can't do anything when I'm found guilty of rumors that don't even have merit.

2019-04-23, Manager,"Waltham, MA","Current Employee, more than 1 year",Toxic work environment stay away,"modern facility with great cafeteria, variety of food options, the pay is also competitive, and some of the people there are nice
","This company is toxic on so many levels. There's bias on management and endless toxicity aimed at females, minority and older workers. They try to promote diversity inclusion however, this isn't the case. The distribution of work is uneven, there are certain teams where the workload is unevenly distributed primarily amongst teams with minority, females and older workers. Be prepared to work 12-15 hour days almost everyday and on weekends. The salaries are great but the number of hours worked in addition to the added pressure to perform is not worth the money at all. There's a lot of insecurities within management and often those insecurities are taken out on the employees. Onboarding is basically non existing management wants employees to perform without proper training and understanding of the complexity of this company. Every year the company cuts the bottom 10% of its employees. If your salary is on the average range be prepared to receive low/no annual raise and low bonus payments. People are stressed angry and management usually take the anger out on the employees almost everyday. This company is also not flexible with allowing work from home even though the option is there but its frowned upon when you do. Finally most employees have 3 weeks paid vacation however, its impossible to request time off, be prepared to work on vacation or put in endless nights before and after vacation. Vacation time is also on use it or lose it basis, so the time can't be carried over. Finally your HR partner is not here for you, they don't care about you any confidential conversation will be sent back to your manager so be careful and trust no one. I've never experienced stress the way that I do working for Thermo, te people I worked with would throw me under the bus all the time. Stay away if you're looking for a normal life, good work life balance and balanced mental health. They also hire alot of external candidates and does not promote within unless you are chosen by management.
Advice to Management
Learn to pay attention to your employees, their stress level and train your staff so they can properly understand the complexity of the business. Focus on evenly distribute work flow and stop promoting diversity inclusion, talent until you've fixed the issue of toxicity and unfair treatment to females and minorities. To retain talent you MUST properly onboard and train your employees, Stop trying to have them figure it out. Promote your employees and stop making them feel like the work they're doing does not add value to your bottom line because it does (its reflective on the quarterly returns). The company has potential to be a great place to work but the stress and gender bias will ALWAYS drive your good employees to leave.

2019-04-12, Scientist,"Cincinnati, OH","Current Employee, more than 3 years",Look somewhere else,"I can put something on my resume
","There is zero communication within the business, and it often falls on the lab. Schedules are chaotic, with turnaround times and expedites dominating the work to be done, which leaves large backlogs and disgruntled employees. Management is useless and despite communication, show very little willingness for change. Coworkers have been leaving left and right to escape, with no replacements and long wait times for approvals just to post a position, which leaves us highly understaffed. They dont want to hire people full time, even when contractors prove to have a great work ethic and strong drive. They also show resistance in promoting current employees, but will shovel on the responsibilities and workload of 2-3 people into one in order to save money. The building is falling apart, and all ""fixes"" are purely cosmetic. Benefits have gone down with the price going up, PTO got slashed, we are on average paid less than other sites within the same company in the same areas and IT is impossible to work with. The Cincinnati ""Patheon, a part of ThermoFisher"" site a dead end company to work for, and I would highly recommend looking anywhere else to keep your sanity intact.

2019-03-28, Scientist,"Eugene, OR","Former Employee, more than 3 years",In a word; RUN.,"Pay is acceptable for the area, but should be negotiated prior to start date as there will be slow slow SLOWWW wage progress post hiring.

Despite operations being LITERALLY THE WORST PLACE I HAVE EVER BEEN EMPLOYED, R&D appears to be a great environment. In other words, as long as you avoid production roles you are probably fine.
","-Metrics are everything. Which would be fine, if they were based in reality. 
-Constant stress and headaches over unrealistic goals. Moving goal posts.
-No opportunity for growth and advancement 
-Rampant favoritism 
-Promotions are not typically based on merit 
-Treated like a slave 

I was constantly told that ""every corporation is like this"" and ""you should be more grateful, you have it very good here!"" by people who have only ever worked in one place. 

Unless you want to spend your day getting reamed for walking around or taking too long of a break/lunch (OH! Don't worry, they'll time you) I would avoid this place like the plague. Find a normal job somewhere else, where they do real science.

Additionally, if you end up in production, some of the chemistry can be quite difficult. Following the batch record may result in failure. However when it comes time for bonus/promotions, you will be reminded that all you do is ""follow batch records"" and you don't ""go above and beyond to make drastic changes to the process"". Which of course you WOULD (updating batch records, etc.) if you had TIME. Which you don't.

Your personal goals are meaningless here, and management will straight up lie to your face about nebulous advancement opportunities just to get you to stay forever. Alternatively, they might straight up tell you that you do not do enough to move up. I'm guessing anyone less then a total savant is considered utterly useless.

Trying to train on processes is like pulling teeth. They are afraid to develop people, because they are worried they will lose them. The ideal employee here is barely smart enough to do the science, is willing to be treated like a blue collar worker, can work 2x faster than a normal human and is willing to lie to support the unrealistic goals.

NO JOKE. They actually discussed taping out a yellow square in front of the chemistry benches. You would have to be in this box a minimum of 8 hours a day, and any time spent away from your box (including bathroom breaks) would be unpaid. 

The philosophy here is ""do more with less"". That philosophy runs DEEP here. That is how they keep the margins on the products at 90% or higher. Personnel is part of the bottom line, so they are only interested in how to keep you down and keep you in the same role forever.

ASK AROUND! Some people have been here for 20-30 YEARS IN THE SAME ROLE. They are not stupid, they are not lazy, they just cannot leave due to having families etc. Thermo KNOWS THIS, and they take advantage of being the only large chemistry employer in the area.

I personally know of at LEAST 7 people who have had full on breakdowns due to the stress level here. There is NO WAY that is normal. 

I could go on, but I think I have made my point clear enough.
Advice to Management
If you do not see people as capital and continue grinding them to dust, you will be left with DUST. Then of course your greatest fear will come to fruition. You will have to do some work yourselves!

Good employee benefits.
","Lots of ""firsts"" which I experienced for the first time:

Expecting things to be done at first go with minimal training on what/how to do things for an entry level candidate.

Lack of transperency. Work evaluated by supervisors within themselves and coming up with bulk emails to slam the work, than telling me straight what's to be fixed and how.

Lack of time allocation from mentor who got transferred to a new role.

Unique way of scheduling appointments with mentor in Outlook to clarify queries, being an entry level candidate.

Terminating someone so quick, without even waiting till half year appraisal, solely based on weekly emails on candidate's progress, than assessing knowledge levels and ways to improve them, considering an entry level candidate.
Advice to Management
Please try hiring co-op/interns, to assess performance for such positions, than terminating in a flash for not being a good fit. 

Please be considerate about the duration on thinking, deciding and terminating someone so quick. Especially doing it in the middle of visa approval period will impact international candidates in their hard earned career.

It is abundantly clear, they are only looking to cover up and ignore blatant discrimination, racism, and abuse of power. Thermo Fisher also does not comply with many workplace standards for safety.

The stress and pressure in the lab are through the roof because they are a contract manufacturer. Their only concern is how much product they can get out the door to make money. With the transition to Thermo Fisher, the benefits went downhill. People lost paid time off and insurance went up with less benefits.

2019-02-17, Field Service Representative,"Toronto, ON","Current Employee, more than 5 years","Okay entry level job, management heavy, highly corporate","Paycheque comes in every two weeks which is nice. Work life balance is okay but management is leaning towards more micro-management (aka the only positive aspect is being removed).
","Awful pay. 

Bonuses are so low they are not worth the effort (example-customer surveys are weighted and gamed against the benefit of the worker so that any negative survey is weighted heavily enough to erase all the positive reviews and eliminate your bonus). They brought in some idiotic Thermo points system that you can overpay for merchandise rather than paying cash. 

Very corporate and very very management heavy. Vice presidents, managers, managers to the managers all with different goals that end up leading to less money, and a worse work life balance. Management themselves are incapable and the classic example of 'management.'

Zero chance for advancement or growth. This entry level job leads nowhere except to hearing your manager make excuses for lack of growth.

Publicly traded on stock market so management makes efforts to look like they're making progress despite the customers lack of desire to own the over-priced, highly unreliable equipment (all bad for the worker).

They do not take care of their staff. Would rather lose their qualified staff than compensate them fairly (high turnover).
Advice to Management
Stop being greedy. Fairly pay the staff that are on the ground in front of the customers. Offer stock options to staff.

Stop gaming the bonuses and reward system negatively against the worker (19 good surveys and 1 bad survey will equal an overall fail and no bonus plus you get a talk from your big brain manager).

- Meet customers who are mostly happy to see you (at least in LCMS) 
- You are very exposed to the instruments you service, making you very attractive for other labs if you ever would like to change job
- you will travel a lot, if that is your thing. You don't really have an office to go to (as a FSE) 
- very nice and detailed training programe
","- As a FSE you will often be on your own, and rarly see your colleagues. However, some customers will usually feel more like your colleagues.
- no overtime payment, or set hours you work at. Some days you start late due to you waiting for reserve parts to arrive, other times you bang your head at some complicated problem until 10pm. It is random
-Traveling and the problematic jobs seems to come in bursts, not an even flow. Can be stressful at times.

If you spend a lot of time in board meetings, or meeting with other management I would suggest you take time to visit some of the productions areas, or walk around the office cubicles, without an entourage, and talk and LISTEN to your employees.

Every person I come into contact with has been great. Benefits and insurance is great they paid completely for a lot of life ins. And my benefits only cost 100 with pretty much everything i could possibly ever need including a lawyer.
","Horrible communication. Should know things way sooner than I found them out, still finding out. Theres no set standardized way of training so you know everything you need to. If something changes you have to hear it through the grapevine and not everyone hears it. Their system is subpar compared to others of a similar calabar in the field. I also dont foresee much room for growth. Only possibly one rung up when the person above me retires.

Have more rigorous training with complete knowledge - instead of learn this for now and we'll teach the rest when you get this down(b.c that never happened until i screwed up.) Too many people telling me too many contradicting things. Complete lack of communication other than the basics. The details that matter get lost and arent thought of or arent told to us as a group.

2018-10-29,Anonymous,"Pittsburgh, PA","Current Employee, more than 5 years","Great Mission, Lacking Alignment","1.) Great Mission
2.) Opportunities to ""Do your own thing."" 
3.) Enjoy my colleagues
","1.) Nobody is aligned. Feels like leaders at all levels (Groups, Divisions, Business Units, Functions) are marching to the beat of their own drum without regard to what the other is doing.
2.) In order to progress/be seen as a high performer, you have to assume multiple roles in the organization vs being given the opportunity to do one job really really well. This is okay for a season, but easily becomes the norm.
3.) We aren't competitive where we need to be from a compensation perspective. We say that we want to hire the best talent, but aren't willing to buy that talent.
Advice to Management
Continue to be conservative where it counts. Though this may be seen as a negative by many employees, this is why we remain viable. Take some time to reflect on what our competitors (direct, indirect, etc.) are doing to attract and retain talent. Doing things the way we've always done them will not result in attracting and retaining the best talent.

-Very noble mission of making the world healthier, cleaner and safer
-CEO is very capable and has achieved very good growth for the company
-Opportunity to work with amazing scientists who constantly push the boundaries of what’s possible 
-Very stable work culture - some employees have been there over 30 years
-Good 401k match and great benefits
-15-20 days paid PTO in addition to 10 annual holidays. Unused PTO can be cashed out when leaving
","-Politics between teams and managers
-It’s hard to impossible to move within the company to different roles
-No free lunch and mediocre cafeteria food
-Very bureaucratic for IT requests, software development, HR processes
-IT policies are very backward - limited guest wifi access, only managers have access to start a web meeting, crappy antivirus that hogs your PC, clunky conferencing hardware. In this modern age, employees should be able to effectively participate in a meeting wherever they are and from any device of their choice.
- San Jose office building and facilities are from the 70s 
-Employees and managers seem to get promoted based on non work related activities such as community and charitable activities. These employees are given the center stage at company gatherings. Employees who actually get work done are taken for granted and get the backseat.
-Company is very stingy with resources even when they are profitable. It's a hassle to get approval for better computer hardware and technical training. Employees going on business trips are asked to drive instead of flying and share the same hotel room to save company money !
Advice to Management
To make the best products, you need to attract and retain top talent. Provide more avenues for employees to ask questions, provide feedback and move between roles without fear of retribution or bad politics. Don't be afraid to clean house once in a while and weed out the bad actors that suck the innovation and intensity of employees.

Invest in modern IT technology that enables employees to collaborate wherever they are and using any device of their choice. Improve the projectors and conferencing hardware instead of penny pinching on everything.

","Long work days. Salary positions are horrible for 10-13 hour work days. Promotions happen to those that work long days. They maybe inefficient with their work load, but in eyes of management; they're hard workers. 10-15% paycut compared to it's competitors in Bay Area. Don't work here if you're trying to feed a family. But great place for new grads to take a paycut and learn industry work.
Advice to Management
Invest in your talent workers. Pay somewhat comparable to your competitors. Try to lower the attrition rate. Give lower management the head count they need to build the products. Standardize the GMP and not combine 3 different companies and product lines into one lab room. Atleast offer a free piece of pastry or muffin on Friday mornings to staff for their hard work. This is not a tech company like Facebook or Alphabet; however, you can afford to treat your workers with more respect. Please ask the manufacturing director to not say you can no longer afford to give out donuts at staff meetings when you generate over $20 billion a year.

","Expectation is 50 - 60 hours per week. No upper management acknowledgement that we have home lives and families. Department did not honor corporate Flex Time Policy. Constantly driving us to ""be the best"" , but employees did not get professional training so they could improve or achieve. Only the contractors did. The favoritism toward certain members of the department was not at all veiled. Management would jump to conclusions without hearing all the facts. Corporate business partners were treated as customers; therefore, they were allowed to be abusive. They are not customers. They are business partners. We should be working together. With mutual respect, consideration and goals. The message management sent to them was that we were their doormats and they could abuse us all they wanted to. The message sent to their employees was ""you are a commodity, nothing more.""
Advice to Management
Listen to your employees. They know a lot more about what is going on than you do. Learn to respect your employees. Acknowledge that the job is not their life. Allow them to have a personal life. If they are allowed to rest once in a while they will perform better for you. Look at the crazy staff turnover in some departments. That is not on the employees, that is on upper management.

PTO time is good.

","Very cliquish. 
Toxic team environments. 
People don't matter, only revenue. They will work you until you drop even if they can afford to hire another body to help out.
Some very toxic leaders who contaminate those who report to them. 
Your performance is based on a comparison to everyone else's performance in your team/group even if you do completely different jobs and it is highly subjective.
Performance reviews are very old school and out-of-date, they don't help you to succeed.
Promotions are based on if your boss likes you, or if you are part of the ""in"" crowd, not based on your actual performance.
They don't help you succeed, and it sometimes feels like they purposely stand in your way of succeeding.
Getting what you need when you first start is a nightmare. 
Training? What training?
Diversity is highly limited in every way. Clearly it isn't valued because it isn't there.
Advice to Management
Stop with the ""good ole boys"" club and start to value what individuals bring to the table.

Culture of keeping your mouth shut, head down, don't try to affect change, and that's the best way to survive and get promoted.

I don't blame the managers or the directors. I feel that it's a change that needs to happen beyond the SLT. Someone needs to step up and put safety and quality first before on-time delivery of product.
Advice to Management
Invest in the proper systems to get the job done such as a new ERP system, fix broken processes within the shop floor, focus on quality and safety before the delivery of product.

2018-07-23,Anonymous,,"Current Employee, more than 5 years","Growing Company, Very Difficult Culture","Thermo Fisher Scientific is a growing company. The pay is good. The benefits are good. Some of the people who you work with are great.
","The culture and leadership style are like the military. The boss tells you what to do, and you do it, no questions asked. Any comment that is contrary to what anyone else says is taken as a negative comment, even when you are not trying to be negative, but constructive. There is a true fear of having an open and honest conversation, as the discussion will be held against you. You will be labeled as ""not a team player"" and that is how people may talk about you. Once this happens, your time at Thermo is limited. They have a very high turnover rate. This is due to the fact that 1. they let a lot of people go, and 2. a lot of people want to leave due to the difficult culture. 

This leads to an unbalanced work / personal life. I typically work 12 hour days and some time on weekends. As they ""reorganize,"" which is another name for downsizing, doing the same work with fewer people, the workload gets more difficult. Now their employment is growing, but you need to realize they are acquiring more and more companies. I had a woman work for me for 3 years, and she was happy and worked hard without me asking her to. She moved to a new boss who is more inline with the culture here, and she has been on the phone crying to me in the last 3 months several times. The sad part is no one can say anything to management or HR because then their job is in jeopardy. They are not a ""team player."" 

Last, one way they manage their cost is they let go of older talent, who also tend to be more expensive. They don't value the experience of the older employees, and thus, they just cut them to save the money. Then, they put someone with much less experience, or no experience in their place, and tell them to just do the job with minimal training.
Advice to Management
It is easy to look at the cost side of everything, but when you look at the value side, you have so much more potential for upside than just cost cutting. I understand that we are running a business, but people make up the business, and people will go the extra mile without the need for fear and intimidation. You set the culture, and the culture needs to change. There is a very hostile work environment for many people, and you can't hear it because they are afraid to speak up. They don't want to lose their jobs because they have bills to pay, kids to put through college, and many people don't like looking for a new job. 

I know it is hard to change, and there is a risk. The company is doing well and growing. So, messing with the culture could put that at risk. But, the human cost is too high. People need to be happy where they work, and not feel intimidated and fearful of their management. (I am afraid to click the submit button to post this here because of the backlash I might receive, even believing it is somewhat anonymous.)

","Senior managers that are completely unprofessional and disrespectful, yelling at employees on conference calls for doing their jobs. 

No career advancement. No real directions from senior IT leadership. A lot of dog/pony shows and buzz words but no real progress or understanding of how to reach goals.

If you were a legacy Pittsburgh employee you have no future with IT as is seen after *all* of the infrastructure managers were removed in the last 2 years. If you want to try for another job within Thermo, well good luck. 

If you are looking for work balance you will not find it here. Sure, IT operations requires a lot of hours and always has. But Thermofisher is completely willing to bury you day after day, every weekend, and holidays so that you can work on other peoples issues. They will berate you on technical calls involving 30 or more managers instead of letting you work with your service partner to fix the issue promptly.
Advice to Management
Management has forgotten 2 of the the companies core values. 
Involvement- you have not involved the Pittsburgh IT employees for 3 years! 
Integrity - The way you treat your employees is the exact opposite of integrity. So many very qualified IT staff members have left because of your utter BS that we are left with Life/new employees that are completely clueless.

Management is also willing to ignore its audit compliance and assume the risk of not completing key deliverables hoping no one will notice while snowing its external auditors. This started in 2016.

2018-03-26, Process Engineer,"San Jose, CA","Former Employee, more than 3 years",Plenty of opportunity if you want it,"Overall I have had an excellent experience at Thermo Fisher. When I was hired I felt insecure after a recent layoff at my previous company. Thermo Fisher has offered me tremendous opportunities for growth, which I took advantage of, and I am now leaving to go to graduate school armed with greater confidence and many more skills.

Some highlights:
1. Mentorship and interaction with executives - Directors and VPs were readily accessible and open to my questions about how their business worked
2. Education outside of Thermo Fisher - they sponsored several expensive graduate courses at Stanford, in addition to offering many other employee training opportunities
3. Access to new challenges - I consistently felt supported and challenged in my roles, and my previous managers wrote excellent letters of recommendation for me which helped me get into a competitive graduate program
4. Opportunities for advancement - in my first role, it wasn't obvious what my next job would be if I sought a promotion, but it's such a large organization, that there are opportunities everywhere. I think they make a significant effort to promote from within.
5. Work life balance - I worked in San Jose and Sunnyvale and at both sites I thought the work life balance was good for ""professional track"" employees. I did close to no work on weekends, and felt like my schedule was very flexible as long as I was achieving results. Working from home was usually an option, unless there was work I needed to do in-person on the products themselves (I'm an engineer).
","1. Culture - typical of many major corporations. There's a significant amount of bureaucracy and it can be difficult to make changes even if the solutions are easy and obvious. 
2. Pay raises for hard workers - if you don't get promoted, your annual pay increase will be 1-2.5% MAX. My manager told me once, ""if you work hard, you'll get a 2% pay raise, if you work really hard, you'll get a 2.5% pay raise."" Which I didn't find very motivating.

","The entire department is chaos, no one knows what they are supposed to do, 3 out of 4 managers are completely clueless and when put on the spot, they will dump all responsibilities on you.

You will not get support from manager, you will not get training, you will learn by making mistakes and being blamed for it.

Managers and HR are intrusive, they will monitor your personal life, your breaks, doctor appointments (I had to wait a week before being given the time off and I was asked to provide the reason).

Managers will use scare tactics to make you work overtime and weekends (extending your probation period, shouting at you, asking you if you really want this job).

Workload is unbearable, you will be doing the work of 2 people, which means that you are bound to forget to do things or running out of time, you will be blamed and asked to provide full details on why and how you could have possibly forgotten something, while all the things you are doing well are completely oblivious to the management.

The department is badly organised, management is not aware that computers have been invented, you will print everything and archive it in a box, there is no database, only the boxes in storage. I have spent hours looking for a piece of paper which could have been scanned and stored in a database. Thermofisher is not a green company, you will spend your days printing.

I worked for 7 months and I know of 6 people who suffered from burnout, some people came and left within a week. They are 25 people in the team.
If you are asked to give suggestion on how to improve the department, do not answer, it is a trick question, you will be reported to HR for having a negative attitude.

The company is located in the middle of nowhere, if you don't have a car, it will be difficult to get to work, you can take the bus, emphasis on THE bus, there is only one which runs once an hour, if you miss it, you have to take a taxi which will cost 10 pounds. The bus is always full, be prepared to stand.

You can take the job if you are desperate, my advice would be to keep looking for something else, the department will not get better as long as the managers are there.

Business Outlook
Pros
Not much to say that is positive
Cons
Dishonesty ,cowardly and two faced behaviour from line management - no feedback and communication. Not once did my line manager offer and arranged a 1 to 1 meeting to discuss or manage expectations or if there were existing issues so watch your back. 

By then they will go straight to senior management or HR to be involved just to intimidate you when it could be handled more softly.

Face fit and blame culture - they will try and find every little fault about yourself and discredit you no matter how petty it sounds as to why you don't fit. So make you feel its your fault and humiliate you bordering on racial discrimination.

Disjointed systems meaning work duplication and poor data management. There are not the most efficient at managing their data and storing.

Office is near a landfill site so you need a car to get there but car park in poor condition - I had 3 punctures all with nails stuck in my tyre whilst working there.

I heard that the person who took my role also left very shortly afterwards. 

If you are use to fast pace , high intensity and very proactive environment then this is not the company for you because you will always feel you're being held back when trying to get things done by the bureaucracy and the internal politics.

2018-02-15, Senior Financial Analyst,"Carlsbad, CA",Former Employee,LSG finance is not a happy place.,"Base Salary and bonus are pretty good. Med benefits are standard. 15 Days of PTO which technically includes your sick time, but “working from home” when sick does happen. ESPP exists, but discount is smaller than usual. Really nothing overly special other than that it is a large stable company.
","Hard to progress with the amount of favoritism taking place. Even then, they seem more likely to hire from outside than promote from within. Deadlines are often unrealistic. All of their financial systems and data are a disaster. They acquire or restructure their businesses so frequently that it often makes any financial analysis so confusing as to be nearly worthless. Unless you are a director (with an office), you will have zero personal space. You will be seated in a huge open floor, in blocks of six seats, three per side. You will feel like your elbows are basically touching the people next to you, and you can see the people across from you... and that’s just within your block. It didn’t feel like finance was very appreciated there, even within finance, and there was just a general undercurrent of insincerity surrounding everything, especially performance reviews. If you are happy with you current employer, and your happiness is more valuable to you than whatever pay bump you might get here, then I’d recommend staying put.

 TF is constantly acquiring other companies to keep there stock price up, but reinvest minimally back into existing divisions. The Grand Island NY division is falling apart. Equipment and facility are old and not being repaired properly. Could be a real great place if money was reinvested back into it. Instead, senior management put up smoke screens to pretend everything is peachy so their budgets look good and they get their juicy bonuses. They never let corporate TF know the true story.

The company's name- do not stay here for more than 2 years. In some positions-You will not learn anything
","Unless working in the lab, not a good place to work if you have a science degree. If you do have such a degree, do not take tech support and customer service positions. In tech support, about 70% of what you do is customer service work. Do not believe the job description. You've been warned. 

Favoritism by management and throwing newer employees under the bus as well as taking advantage of them. 

Managers/supervisors with no backbone

Incompetence beyond belief, highly disorganized, nepotism, top heavy, and the company is too big for its own good. No company culture. 

Bitter employers. I have coworkers who think that because they have been with the company for so long that they don't have to do anything and management is aware. More seasoned employees will not share all that they know with newer employees in order to hold on to their job security. There are ppl who have held the same exact position for 20-30 years. There's no real cross training. 

Useless onsite HR. Have to contact offsite HR for everything.
Advice to Management
Please treat all employees fairly or they will not stay, regardless of the benefits you offer. Please structure your departments in such a way that employees' skills are utilized and that they are not doing work that they are way too over qualified for.

Upward mobility is encouraged and managers will hire within the company whenever possible.
","Thermo Fisher is a large and corporate.

1-Keep recognizing and rewarding good work in employees. Employees who work well are often promoted or recognized in some way, which gives extra incentive for the employee to do their best. 2-Cut the dead weight; the loyalty to their employees can sometimes be abused by lackluster employees.

2017-09-26,Anonymous,,Current Employee,"A bit of luck, a bit of hard work, and a lot of playing the game","We have the opportunity to make ""uncapped"" commissions, but in order to do so, you must understand the pay plan. There is a flexible work schedule that allows you to adjust your days to best fit your needs. There is freedom in your role to take advantage of traveling opportunities, networking events, and trade shows, but this is mostly based on favoritism or the territory you are assigned (not necessarily your achievement). When you start you receive 15 days of PTO to be used however you want.
","Blankly put, the pay is bad. You will get paid very similarly to your counterparts, no matter the size of your territory. If you make $3M in profit for the company, you will make the same as a rep who is only required to make $1M. You make your year's salary in one week and then rake in money for the company with seemily no payout as a sales person. Our pay plan pays cents on the $10,000.
Advice to Management
Relative to peers in our same job roles at other companies, we make much less. Most of our work feels like customer service and not necessarily sales. A lot of opportunities are rewarded to individuals who are viewed in a negative light by their coworkers. The work can be very unfair in the department with many people doing a ton of work and others getting by with huge accounts that require no hand-holding. A lot of seasoned reps just do well enough to get paid and don't want to work too hard, knowing that next year you are forecasted based on this years' achievement. This creates laziness and a very bad environment for new reps who want to move up and out. Everyone knows that you will only make more money if you leave the company, and it is encouraged by the amount of turnover in the department (over 1/3 of reps have been with the company less than 2 years).

","There is a culture of continual improvement which in itself is good. I just felt that some of the meetings were time wasting really; just to fulfil the corporate expectation of analysing all processes to save time and money. It felt like having meetings for meetings sake. There was even a feeling of deja vu as somebody actually said, 'Didn't another team resolve this issue last year'!! A team did spend time looking at it but few of the initiatives seemed to have been carried out.
Also some of the staff here were difficult to work with as there was a clique mentality in some departments with a lot of back biting. There was a lot of legitimate complaints about some members of staff but no headway in resolving the issues as the bullying just carried on.
Advice to Management
Stop the constant nit picking continuous improvements where some members of staff have to sit on 3 teams a year to fulfil a personal performance review. Just think about the time wasted when some people just don't want to be there when they could be more productive just doing their job.

","HR is not involved with employees and there are some leaders that are only interested in numbers. When there is an issue with a manager, HR is nowhere to be found. I worked there for 6 years and had 5 managers. My last manager did not treat me fairly and I was out. I know of 3 other employees that ended in the same way with different managers. All in the same discipline. No warnings, no corrective actions, no good reasons. Lastly, when an employee survey from the group came back with low scores, the employees were gathered and asked to re-submit the scores. One of their core values is supposed to be integrity. They didn't ask why the scores were low and instead gathered the group and asked that we rethink our answers. That is not integrity in my book.
Advice to Management
Listen to employees, not just the managers. If a whole group is having issues, maybe it's the manager. Encourage honesty to foster improvement. Have HR act impartially so the employee has a voice. You have lost a lot of talented people because of a lack of a voice upwards.

","Don't know where to start, my advice to you is just stay away from this place. The most dysfunctional company I ever worked at. Nothing is in its place and work right. There is no system in place. High turn around with no permanent HR or IT. Toxic culture and Gang-Like, only lazy incompetents fit in this culture.

In R&D you get to do the most boring task on the earth, trying to come up with an idea for an assay and you will continue to work on that for a while like 2 years, then you get scrutinized for example because it doesn't sell as well or there is a better product out there.

Very Very incompetent manager (Directors), who only want to keep their job and a friendly incompetent employees. R&D staff have a very toxic ""click culture"" who only gets a long with incompetent low motivated employee of their own kind. 

No good product is made in Thermo Fisher Scientific. They have people with no experience who are working on things they are just learning about.

No development opportunity is provided to R&D employees. Director constantly on his own pleasure off time (god knows where) and employees are forced to work over time to finish projects on their set deadlines.

You have to work 24/7 to keep up with their non-functional tasks/deadlines and you wont be appreciated at all.

Just do yourself a favor and stay away from this place.

","Leadership will never WALK the TALK, especially the annual ""farcical"" employee involvement survey, it is the most hypocritical input/output process. only pockets of leaders take it seriously, else this Company is a finance driven company (read top line and bottom line impact) and don't be waylaid by any of their PR campaign or propaganda about saving lives/ making a difference in healthcare or the foray into precision medicine. 

Jobs at few of their sites being outsourced to Lithuania. 
Inner circle of decision makers primarily comprised of middle aged caucasians patting each other's backs and will never reinvest in their fragmented IT infra and equipment infrastructure, as it is an extremely "" profit-driven"" culture. 
Demoralizing way of developing and engaging millennials : another classic example of ""your new innovative ideas"" may have worked at your previous employer, but this is the way it always works here. 
And they only talk about SMART goal setting for all employees: however goals are ONLY set ( sorry shoved down) to APPEASE finance VPs and Corporate execs. 

Lots of examples of "" fake it till you make it"" especially at the VP level 
No wonder there is attrition at every level.

2017-06-17, Project Manager,"Horsham, England, England","Former Employee, more than 5 years",Good starting ground,"Takes on relatively inexperienced staff and trains them, it's a place where you can start a career and gain experience. Always opportunities to get involved with internal projects, make a difference and get your name out there. Staff on site are pleasant and make it a good place to work. Change management is reasonably well done and at a good pace.
","Culture of bullying is present throughout the business unit from the top down so very hard to get away from. You are often made to feel like you should feel fortunate to work there as you're not good enough to get a job elsewhere - that sort of thing. Micromanagement is rife and employees are always physically watched by their manager, there is little trust in that way. It feels a lot like school, I once got told off because I had my elbows on the table and desk inspections took place to ensure you were being tidy. I felt this had no place in an office of highly experienced, degree-level professionals. 
Remuneration is low and below industry standards but the company knows this and this is their approach so negotiate what you are happy with up front. Appraisal system is harsh, requires a lot of work from the employee but it is fair and you are measured directly against your peers, the better you do the better % pay rise you will get but expect about 2%. Poor performers will need to improve fast or expect to be managed out. 
Although change management is done well overall employees are not listened to if they want to raise concerns. Workload was very high and most staff were considerably overloaded. No-one left the office on time.

","I heard a lot of criticism about my work and performance but little to no praise for it. First example, my manager was out sick for a couple of days. On my initiative, I posted a large note outside her cube to let people know. When my manager came back in, she was flabbergasted that I had done such a thing. Yes, she used the word, flabbergasted. She chewed me out for about 10 minutes. She claims that she told me not to do that before, but I do not remember the conversation. Second example, my manager called my work on an operator manual a failure. Yes, she used the word, failure. She pointed out specifics. I pointed out some things I did correctly in the document, but that did not seem to matter to her. When I asked my manager why I did not receive any compliments from her about my work, she did offer one, but I have not heard another compliment since.

I did not feel that I contributed to the company much. For example, my manager read and provided feedback on everything I wrote including some of my email messages. Although her feedback was valuable and improved the documents, I feel that things might have gone faster if she simply did the work herself. She often complained about how much time she spent redlining my work.

I did not feel that I was allowed to think for myself or take initiative in solving problems. For example, my manager asked me to resolve a conflicted files problem in our software versioning and revision control system. I asked a co-worker to help me, and we spent some time on the phone to resolve it. He seemed happy to help me, and we solved it. Afterwards, my manager told me not to waste his time and that every work-related problem I have should go through her first. She also called that co-worker to apologize to him for wasting his time, which I did not feel was necessary.

","They do not offer the sales representatives the support they need to the daily paperwork. No support for filling out forms or proposals. Real nightmare to get things done cause you to work 12 hours a day. 8 hours in front of customers not including drive time, airports and hotels to fill out daily paperwork and proposals. If you land to big an account, they will take it direct to keep you from getting the big commissions and then they raise your quota next year and take that account direct.

-There is general stability of the company as a whole.
-They've really pushed to start to help people understand their own career development. Some of the tools and speakers that are provided would be expensive to source ourselves.
-There are allotted volunteer hours, if small. And donation-matching for certain charitable efforts.
-The new maternity/paternity leave is impressive.
","-TFS still pays below the median in Pittsburgh and it will only be more evident as larger and more progressive companies come to the area. Having good health insurance is great and I am grateful, but it isn't as attractive to younger employee that is trying to build their life and pay their student loans.
-Annual raises are abysmal and below even typical COLA, so employees are constantly moving laterally to try to get ahead. This means that there are rarely people that want to improve their current roles past what it would take for them to move to another role. 
-The facilities are in the middle of nowhere and there is no public transit access, so you must have a car. This alienates a portion of viable candidates that aren't interested in the expense of a vehicle or can't afford it. Pittsburgh's budding metro area will only propel young professionals to have a lifestyle without a vehicle and look elsewhere.
-There are silos and divides everywhere that leads to very few people that are cross-functional. There is animosity between those employees whose work is considered more transactional and those whose work is considered analytical. The push is to consolidate the transactional work without really thinking or validating that those employees are producing the majority of the viable results. When things go wrong, there are no subject matter experts to work through the deltas. And something always goes wrong.
-The push for updating tools is commendable, but the tools that are being updated are the least important. There are inventory and order-intake tools that are decades old, but the company is focused on a facebook-like communication tool. Why?
-Diversity is touted, but hardly practiced as the band level increases.
Advice to Management
-If there is any contingent that is going to be in Pittsburgh in the future, it is important to instill trust into those employees that are integral to the processes that have been in place. The median age in most departments is alarming. Who is left to impart the knowledge to to actually complete tasks and not just analyze how efficiently they're being completed?
-Better raises mean happier employees that want to make their departments better and more productive. 
-ERGs are awesome, but only if their values are being practiced throughout the company. Diversity is more than just a word.

- Emerging Technologies Teams are very energetic. Great open culture
- Very flexible work schedules. Easy to strike work life balance
- Employee feedback is taken seriously by ET Senior Management
- Teams are encouraged to share and learn from each other
","- lot to improve on hiring tech leads and first time managers.
- HR is very negative. Need world class HR talent if we envision to be most admired company. Everything else is improving but this is a big drag
- Unnecessary and bloated HR Org - partner, manager, country, TA, Administrative HR. Employee ends up with confusion on why there are so many roles for a simple HR function. Each simple query or decision takes years and mostly results in a negative outcome due to incompetent handing.

Stop with unrealistic timelines for delivering projects. Appreciate employees not just by a mention, rather through more action.

- AP department is run like a old fashion small factory where the manager is allowed to abuse and bully the new employees
- Lack of basic knowledge on finance, accounting and IT
- Bad attitude of management generate unpleasant employees and constantly people talking in the back of their colleagues
- your capabilities are never recognized (often manager hide your skills from other manager to don't feel ignorant )

I worked with a lot of smart, hard-working people that I liked.
","I was not stretched too thin, but colleagues across the organization were, which made it difficult to get things done (want legal to review a simple MTA change? Give it a week or two... have a question for someone in AP or procurement? Good luck.)

Leading manufacturer of biotechnology's most essential products
","Goal of management is to optimize not just their products, but also their employees to their maximum - unaware that people are not robots, and burn-out is a thing

No real innovation - since culture is of acquiring companies to become an Amazon of sorts for biotechnology, they buy the tech and scale it as high as possible, quality be damned

Health insurance is expensive

Goals are for show, moving up is quite difficult in the provided structure.
Advice to Management
As part of the San Diego Affymetrix acquisition, most were excited at the prospects and opportunities a big company would bring but also for professional development. However, Thermo killed the once vibrant, family-like stick-together into one of each person for themselves, in less than a year. It's corporate in the biggest sense. All innovation or self-motivation taken out of the picture so employees are forced to focus on extreme deadlines with no time, or real incentive to help each other out.

Tone-deaf decisions with no employee satisfaction in mind: not going to succeed by providing a few Town Halls to vent his concerns. No transparency, unnecessary relocation to Carlsbad away from a biotech hub into a cramped space, false incentives when there's no hope of promotions, same below market eBioscience salaries. 

Overworking employees because some guy in a suit somewhere arbitrarily picked some numbers to meet unaware of mfg groundwork. Layoffs were awkward. New leadership has no idea of culture and makes no effort to understand, leading to people not being utilized for their strengths. Conversations need to be more intimate, stepping out of their offices but that's if mgmt actually wanted to act on these concerns..

Senior leadership needs to really examine how they are taking decisions. You can make us read endless acronyms and Thermo's ""values"" but end of the day, if your really want efficiency you have to mutually provide to employees; or else a thriving, collaborative group quickly falls apart ...and takes their expertise elsewhere...

Felt like working on a nice college campus and this contributes greatly to the overall feeling of going to work there everyday.

Generally uses state-of-the-art business platforms so this is a good place for upgrading your technological skills in the business world. It is a paperless company.

Not a lot of perks, but lots of freedom to get out of the office and walk around outside, which may sound funny but is actually a HUGE perk in terms of getting through the work day and enjoying where you work.

2017-04-05,Anonymous,,Former Employee,"Company doesn't live up to its 4is (Integrity, Innovation, Intensity, Involvement), has a high cryonism culture.","Medical benefits were OK. Seem comparable to others in the area.
401K match 
3 weeks paid time off.
Large global organization with the ability to work with people of a variety of backgrounds.
","High cronyism culture - meaning that people are hired and promoted based on their connections and close friendships with others in the organization (not necessarily based on ability).
Salary is very low. Often is at the low end of the market. Yearly increases are very low, sometimes not even enough to cover cost of living. How do they expect someone who is making $15/hour to survive on this wage? This results in a lot of turnover. 
Managers expect salaried employees to check emails at night and over the weekend to get things done. Often managers send requests last minute and expect an employee to work on it over the weekend. Work life balance is OK for some, but not others. 
Culture of constant layoffs to meet $$$ numbers driven by corporate. Instead of consistently delivering layoffs, they should be hiring competent managers who know how to manage their employees and know when to let go of under performing people.
Culture of throwing people under the bus is definitely prevalent. People do not own up to their mistakes and responsibilities, but rather blame others. So much for the value of integrity.
Lack of communication from senior leadership/management to employees and departments are often siloed.
Managers tend to do a great job of managing up, but do not know how to properly manage their own employees. 
Responsibilities and expectations are not clearly defined for employees. 
Lack of employee recognition. Often employee's hard work goes unnoticed and is never recognized. Sometimes employee's don't care about monetary rewards as much as they would appreciate being recognized for their efforts. 
Lack of career development conversations with management. As mentioned above, it is a high cronyism culture, so many employees who were promoted were just buddies with higher ups. 
No sick time offered 
No perks like other companies in the Silicon Valley. If you're going to try to compete with other companies in this area, you need to do a major overhaul on your company culture and company perks. Thermo offices in the Silicon Valley are stuck in the past and how things were done years ago. 
There is an employee survey every year, and management doesn't do a good job of actually making lasting long-term improvements. Instead, they put band aids every year to make it look like they are doing something to better their employees.
Advice to Management
Company culture has to change drastically for the outlook to change. I think a culture change will take a lot of time to reshape. Recognize your employees who are working hard and performing well. Stop focusing on layoffs and focus on managing your employees so that you won't have to do layoffs. If you paid well and brought in more high performers, rather than good to average employees, you might not have to consider layoffs.

","Thought this job would be a great way to start a career. Wow, was I deceived. If you are a Media Production Operator, have fun dealing with the favoritism and sucking up, not to mention the rude and inconsiderate attitude by fellow employees. Management is so uncoordinated and disorganized. The environment I worked in was a complete joke. My position was made for people who wanted to go nowhere in life, or they had no other option due to being a foreigner or having familial obligations, or maybe a combination of both. Unprofessionalism and favoritism were the worst parts to me. And don't get me started on how they love taking advantage of hard working people. I was working on a machine that really needed to be ran by two people, and required more physical energy in one hour than other people in my department put in in their 10 hour shifts. Did management care? I'll leave that up to the imagination. My advice would be to stay away from this place. I got direct hired, however most people must go through a temporary hiring service before they can become full time employees. And who decides when they are worthy? You guessed it: Supervisors. I've seen hard working temporary people take up to 9-12 months to get hired on FT. I've also seen people who love to be buddy buddies with the leads and Supervisors get hired within the minimum time of 3 months. Work here at your own risk, I could go on and on, but this is just the very tip of the iceberg.

","Limited ability to advance without a strong senior advocate. There is absolutely a good old boys club that places a ceiling on people regardless of their abilities. Business processes are often developed and used more to maximize profit than to truly serve the customer. In many divisions/locations, work-life balance is something that is paid lip service and nothing more. The extra hours and effort are seldom rewarded as favoritism is rampant. The compensation diminishes the longer you stay as they do not provide merit increases commensurate with effort or that match pace with cost of living increases.
Advice to Management
Senior management is not appropriately engaged and there are a number of middle management folks that are dreadful. Many rank and file employees have excellent ideas that are routinely ignored or hijacked by local managers to make themselves look better. As a manager myself, it disgusted me to see this happen over and over with no repercussions to the offenders. Many talented folks leave because they are overworked and unappreciated. Come out of the ivory towers for more than a couple of hours and actually talk to people. As a people manager for over a decade, I never once met the CEO or had an opportunity to do so. Very strange way of behaving.

","After 5 years with Thermo Fisher, I can say 3.2 rating reflects the Thermo Fisher employee experience. 

The Talent Acquisition organization in Thermo Fisher is a terrible place to be. First, the politics. Lots of gossip flying around every day about who TA's big boss likes, the person she likes seemed to be disliked by everyone else, and how that person likes to hire her own people and get rid of every one that's not her friend. Because people in this TA team likes gossip, you'll soon hear baseless comments/gossip about your work from everyone. 

Apart from the gossip and politics, there is also very little work-life balance. I found myself having to work way more than 9hrs a day to keep the stakeholders happy. 

If you could find a place that's rated higher than Thermo Fisher, then don't come here.

2. continuously fast paced work environment
3. As with most corporations, employees are continuously required to do more with less--resource constraints make it difficult to deliver the best work
4. poor employee on-boarding
5. contract workforce typically does not often convert to FTE positions, resulting in revolving door of new trainees
6. heavy focus on recruiting and attracting millennials and less-experienced, lower-wage employees
7. not a great deal of ethnic or gender diversity above the director level

","Leaderahip has favorites. Inability to grow and develop high performers on your team unless you are one of the chosen few. Director level disfunction - not a cohesive team. Finger pointing and lack of ownership. Nothing will ever change unless you see and own your part and take steps to stop the disfunction.
Advice to Management
Directors-figure out how to launch a succesful product, set reasonable goals, and stick to them! Stop driving unrealestic goals and dates to meet arbitrary metrics that show you are doing the right thing. Customer is affected each and every time you launch a product that is not ready!!! You see this each time it happens!
Celebrate your teams successes rather than continually find fault/opportunities to improve. Support each other and stop finding opportunities to throw each other under the buss.

","If you've ever worked for a company with politics at play, you'll know exactly what I am going to say before I say it. Politics eroded and destroyed the high-performing and trusting TA team I was part of within a few years time. It was mostly the doing of one particularly toxic and unfortunate leader, however when leader with these traits are empowered, the rest is history. The leadership of this team have a few blind spots and a survival instinct. . When added together, this combination left members of the team unsupported and craving a leader who had their back. 

I am a firm believer that open and honest communication can soften any news. I also believe that the integrity of the people that you work for matter. I found myself missing these things tremendously at Thermo Fisher. The only exception is when the project you are leading is a priority for the business. When that is the case, you'll be treated well, and moderately rewarded. But when your high priority project is over, so are you. 

There are so many opportunities right now, don't waste your time on Thermo Fisher. If you do take a chance on them, use it for everything it's worth so you don't look back and regret it. 

I do not regret my time with the company, but being on the other side really puts into perspective how toxic and unhealthy the last 2 years were.

","new sales strategies from leadership leave the sales teams feeling highly micromanaged and demotivated. Constantly changing the sales team product bag due to frantic acquisition rate makes it difficult to be a resource to customers and feeds into the negative reputation as the ""walmart of science"". Recent trends in company policy lead staff to feel more like members of a cold mega corporation instead of a cutting edge big company with a small company personal feel.
Advice to Management
Cut down on dictating blanket policies left and right to the staff and empower your leadership teams to make their own decisions about how to run their districts. Renew an emphasis on rewarding hard work and giving your employees room to be creative as opposed to looking for ways to cut down costs at every corner. Streamline your offerings and create sales strategies for your teams before making massive acquisitions and haphazardly throwing enormous product offerings on to your staff. Come down from the tower and see your teams operate in the trenches, ask for and pursue genuine feedback aggressively.

","As stated in the title, every Thermo Fisher Site is operated independently. My review is for my specific site in Fremont, California. Here at this site, the company grew too fast and the business model and technology could not keep up with the growth. Since the site is operating at a pre-historic pace, while trying to keep up with the industry expectations, this results in long stressful hours and absolutely no work/life balance. To top it off, the salaries do not compete with the current market, but i do hear that management is trying to adjust accordingly based off the current market.
