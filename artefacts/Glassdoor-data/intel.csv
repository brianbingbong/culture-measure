I love having both a mentor and Intel buddy. My Intel buddy has helped me acclimate to the company's culture. My mentor has been helping me with the technical side of things - such as learning test programs; helping me brush up on frequently used programming languages. Not many companies do this; this makes Intel stand out from other companies.

When hired on, get to know your manager. They will help guide you towards the best career path at Intel, whether that is within your current or if it is some other role/department. Continuously communicate your short and long-term goals.

If you're relocating, Intel will provide a relocation allowance.
","There is A LOT of content to learn, but that's ok. The team is not expecting a new team member to fully understand everything. Very frequently I am told that it will take about 1 year for someone to get comfortable with all the needed programs.

Great benefits. Paid 2-months sabbatical leave for refreshing...
","Under some management, treated people as ""resources"", and had made few discouraging decisions reducing career growth especially at lower grade jobs. Too much of a ""machine"" for design.

- The good managers support and advocate for your growth within and outside of the company
- Work/life balance can be fantastic
","- The pressure is on
- Not great for those who don't effectively self-manage their time

- good salary for juniors
","- constant, forced unpaid overhours explained as your low performance (in fact, management doesnt care about workers and uses mobbing to force employees to do the work of 2-3 people alone to the state when you dont even believe you could fit anywhere else)
- mobbing
- salary is critically low after few years of gaining experience and career
- custom working tools - big part of your experience with tools is useless anywhere else outside Intel - after some time you are some kind of addicted of this company, because experienced youve gathered is worth nothing on the outside
Advice to Management
Stop being blind about the rat race and mobbing you're putting because of ""cost cut"". You're earning additional dollars to your excel spreadsheet by the lives, free time, and family of people who work here.

","Moved from halfway across the country expecting to work with my hands and turning wrenches based off of the job description and the interview process but was put in as a recovery tech. All they basically do is sit in front of a computer all day and monitor equipment. Good job if you're fine with staying in one spot for multiple hours but not for me. All the techs in my team had similar expectations when they were hired. Seems like a waste of good talent considering everyone had a background in maintenance.
Advice to Management
Instead of having equipment techs and recovery techs under one title, split them. It takes two different people to do either role. Hire for each role separately.

","Politics, backstabbing, stressful, unhealthy place to work. You are ranked/rated against your peers by a group of managers who don't even know you. If you have knowledge or a skill that will set you above your peers, you had better keep it to yourself lest you help your competition. Teamwork is therefore nonexistent. If you made some processing error or other misjudgment you will be targeted for unsatisfactory performance in the next review period. If you are ranked low enough you will face an IR (improvement required) and be subjected to an embarrassing level of corrective action on top of your current workload. They reward you with more work. If you are nearing retirement you will be targeted. They don't fire employees outright. They make their lives miserable until they cannot take it anymore and then leave. Once you leave you are blacklisted and can never return (though I'm not sure why you would). Engineers literally work 24/7. I was required to call them in the middle of the night and they had to come in. IF the problem was resolved they could go home, get a short nap, and still have to show up for passdown in the fab at 7am. I would try to talk my worst enemy out of working at Intel.

","Not a nimble and agile customer, especially in software products. People who have been around longer (some even 30-40 years!) can be territorial and are protective of their seniority.

Many managers seem to have a good understanding of running a team proactively and successfully.

The company seems to be righting the ship and getting back to a place of leadership in the industry again thanks to efforts of senior management.
","The company has asked me to relocate at short notice and has moved this date forward and back by months with little communication. I've been assigned to work with teams in other sites that requires months of working nights without being paid shift allowance, time in lieu or any effort to compensate for unsociable and unpredictable hours.

Annual reviews are a formality with no input from the employee. Instead it's a predetermined statement that has already been filed by the time the employee gets to see it.
Advice to Management
Watch how team leaders operate. It's noticeable how professional some are while others are managed by their teams.

2021-07-10, Process Engineer,"Chandler, AZ",Current Employee,Great company but WLB is really bad,"Working in a fast paced HVM environment. The pay is good compared to there companies. All process engineers have on-call, but it isn't as bad as Samsung or Tesla. The latter companies need 24*7*365 support and you can expect a call anytime at night. At intel, each PE is on call for 1 week in a month, so its too bad.
","The work is stressful and mundane. Working in the fab is like being in a sweat shop. I have had previous manager who use to micromanage things and call me at 11pm in the night. Luckily my current manager is good.

2021-07-08, Equipment Coordinator and Manufacturing Technician,Leixlip,"Current Employee, more than 5 years",Empty promises.,"Benefits, but everyone else offer the same or better benefits.
Good work and life balance, like anywhere else.
I do like the company (But not my department).
","At least on my department:
As a blue badge: Big salary gap between techs whom are doing the very same jobs as anyone else with the same experience.
 - Poor training, and no trainer follow up, and no follow up of trainers, no one supervises the trainer's progress.
 - No training for someone who will be promoted, and there is no compensation if you get promoted. You will receive the same salary for 5 years (again, life is short, this is not ethical at all).
 - Very poor mentality from some senior techs, with very poor ethics and poor team playing skills. Some new tech are good enough but already got spoiled by the negative team culture.
 - New techs are poorly trained, due to the lack or trainers and lack of safe practice.
 - If you have a project idea, you better never tell anyone, because some techs will steal your idea and get all the credit for it, and the management will do nothing about it.
 - The salary is below national average(if you work on a Tech job for 4 years +). Contractors make way more (including their contracts and expresses to have them on site) than blue badges, contractors are way more organised (Now where is the so called cost saving? For me it is a non-sense excuse).
 - You may get a considerable raise every 10 years.
 - Each time you get a little yearly wage, they will make a big deal and say that you got a bigger raise than anyone else, which is a lie.
 - Too much talk too little action.
 - Empty promises to keep the team motivated, and they pile up and fall at some stage and can go out of control, I find it completely unethical.
 - Because your manager is friendly with you that does not mean that they care.
 - If you work harder than anybody else, all you get is a thank you, nothing else, most of the times not even a thank you.
 - These complains are known to the management and they are totally aware of these negative queries, and they refuse or pretend not to see it... which means things will never change on this particular department.
 - I have seen great talents and individuals leaving the department due to the poor salary, management and poor team ethics.

However, I know from other blue badges who work at other departments, and those departments are way better and totally the opposite of this negative review.
Advice to Management
Be more professional, transparent for real, and please stop making empty promises to everyone on the team, this makes people even more angry and demotivated and this impacts the team performance considerably.
 Two manager meeting per year is enough, you don't need one every two months and with a different promise every time.
 
Make a system. The training grade must be strict to the salary earned, do not promise higher salary before the employee completed the training. This is the most basic and logical business practice to date, first training, then 2 months solid trial, then manager feed back if the position is or is not accommodate for that employee, then promote the employee accordingly. 

Whatever I say will not change. The whole team should be changed, starting from the senior techs which are poisonous to the business health.
 A task force to develop a solid system, training, safety practice, documentation and daily action, staring with solid spec in Layman's.

","Actions speak louder than words. My experience as a lower grade employee (3,5,6,7) I have felt undervalued. When I first joined I felt the complete opposite, but there has been a negative trend starting before I joined. Lowering 401k contributions, removing GPTW freebies, removing quarterlies, dismal focal/insight budgets, ACT(layoffs), frequent hiring freezes, BU specific bonuses (CCG/DCG), frequent reorgs, exorbitant exec compensation all contributed to this trend. It is no longer a company I am proud to work for, it is now just a paycheck.
Advice to Management
For a company of Intel's size, the compensation for software engineers is so far off that it is a demotivating distraction. Don't give out huge allotments of RSUs to fix the compensation for only 25% of employees unless you truly believe that they are the only critical talent. Things are so messed up now. With these critical retention bonuses you now have lower grades making more than higher grades. Also, new hires are getting these RSUs as well. So, you now have grade 5 RCGs making the same as an experienced grade 7, how is this fair? I guess if you want to motivate experienced engineers to leave this is one way to do it.

The current CEO has his eye on the ball. We believe we are getting back on track. The benefit package is unmatched. Intel is very generous with PTO. The Eng Tech shifts are setup for 3 and 4 day work weeks. Most of us value this kind of schedule. Many BS holders stay working as Eng Techs for this schedule.
","There is an unbalanced emphasis on social issues within the company. Why would an engineering company who is trying to regain the lead in the semiconductor industry spend so much effort to tow the line for the Progressive political movement in their internal emails, intranet articles, WBTs, and pay structure? Most would prefer to focus our attention on engineering with an actual meritocracy, where it's the skills we bring matter more than our race, gender, or sexual lifestyle.
Advice to Management
Move back to a meritocracy system if you want to keep talent. Stop cramming the Progressive political agenda down your employee's throats. 
Some groups have decided to prevent workers from transfers into other orgs (TD). This has a negative affect on people's abilities to grow their experience base, and their careers. For this reason, I have started applying for work outside of Intel, and have already generated a lot of interest.

","Toxic workforce kill or be killed. managements principles are to compete with your colleges so everyone is out to get one over on you. Pay is disgusting for shift hours, they will hire you and tell you promotions are yearly and pay will improve, wel forget about promotion for at least 3 years and standard pay rise is 2% (standard inflation in the real world)good pay rise is 5% if ur very lucky. Management is useless, favouritism and scared to deal with certain individuals, no sense of direction, puppets for upper management, will sneak around and follow your activities. HR reps are there to get you to shut up before you go to HR legal. bullying and racism. Night shifts and working every weekend for peanuts. Avoid place has gotten a terrible name in recent years, here only to milk Ireland dry

Intel has a policy they don’t tell you about that won’t allow you to work on their site as a vendor essentially punishing you for not wanting to work with them. Time varies on job position and time employed be sure you really want to be regulated like that before you apply. Also they say they foster innovation through questions and challenges but really they don’t care what you have to say and changes are only made by a PHD holder not the common worker.

","Extremely high workload, constant email and IMs and feeling of always being behind despite constant prioritization and focus on daily tasks. Management doesn’t support employees to increase resources so that employees aren’t over burdened. Management unwilling to talk about career growth, seems they only care if you get work done. Very transactional nature between engineer and management.
Advice to Management
Bring on more people so we are better resourced. That way, the quality of work will be better and employees can be proactive not reactive. Also give employees bandwidth to grow their career and keep up on technical training/learnings.

forget IT.
Advice to Management
Try to not treat people as if they were just a WWID. Prove them that they are important instead of just telling them. All the great values that you make sure to post everywhere on the walls and proud of, they should be evident. They should not be talked about all the time, they should be just followed. Just because they are posted everywhere, they will not be. Another thing to consider: the overhead put on employees that they have to deal with tasks not directly related to their work is too much. One gets the feeling that one's time is not precious at all. Nobody cares how much time a highly educated expensive engineer needs to spend with solving a problem which normally should be an IT topic. This goes to HR/payroll as well. Everything that has already a defined and known procedure works. And everything else doesn't. It would be of benefit for Intel and ease it's employees work and life overall to have it's own IT onsite instead of using externals in call centers around the world. Payroll/HR likewise. With that you would show your people that they matter to you and their work and time is precious and appreciated.

Advice to Management
In a research team of engineers and scientists...EVERYONE should be first-class citizens, with opinions and contributions valued equally. Within Intel Labs, this is not the case. Scientists are clearly valued more highly, even when it comes to software design (which many don't have a professional background in). Engineers are expected to 'fix' sloppy work by scientists and penalized when they are unable to.

Bottom line...if you write code in a professional environment, you should be held to professional processes and standards (or at least be willing to improve your skills). Management needs to understand and enforce this, instead of using engineers as scapegoats for all technical issues (because we have less academic backgrounds or whatever the reason is).

2021-05-11, Technical Program Manager,"Santa Clara, CA","Current Employee, more than 10 years",Improving,"- A new CEO with a lot of experience, great enthusiasm, and deep insight into what has and hasn't worked well for the company. He is making bold moves as part of a multi-year plan to try to correct operational and strategic mistakes of the last 10-15 years. As a huge company with incredibly complex engineering and products that require years of lead time, it will take a few years to gauge the results of his efforts, but employees are more hopeful than I have seen in fifteen years.
- Decent pay and benefits for region, though not exceptional and less than a number of peer companies. 
- Much better respect for work-life-balance than many peer companies. 
- Many nice, supportive, and helpful co-workers. People are always willing to help each other.
- Periodic 4-week or 8-week paid sabbaticals. 
- Good maternity and bonding leave benefits compared to most U.S. companies. 
- Intel has a general expectation that its employees are responsible professionals, so office employees are rarely micro-managed.
","Intel went through a long period of poor CEO choices, where short-term profits and stock performance were prioritized over maintaining technical leadership. This delivered amazing profits while causing massive damage to the company as Intel coasted on its former technical leadership. The most skilled and experienced employees were fired because they were more expensive, employee morale plunged due to all jobs being at risk for the next cost-cutting move, and stock buybacks were prioritized over research and new technology investment.

*That damage weighs heavily on the company today, but is recognized and openly addressed by the new CEO. He has proposed a new multi-year strategy that, while not without risk, is promising and is garnering extensive enthusiasm and support.
Advice to Management
Please restore a sense of job security and an opportunity to build a long-term career. Intel regularly stresses internally how much it values its employees, but its layoff practices, years of benefit cuts, and its preference to fire and replace rather than retrain have demonstrated something different. If an employee was not at a director level or higher, their job was at perpetual risk due to whatever randomly selected metric someone was focusing on in any given year. The new CEO indicates that he recognizes this and that things will improve. Please follow through.

Advice to Management
When you see a future need for new employees then hire early (months, not years) and give your senior employees a chance to train. Instead you hire when the need is NOW and expect your senior employees to carry the weight of sustaining and training, which can lead to high stress and burnout.

","they preach ""inclusivity"" but there is still outdated male mentalities of ""women's place"" or ""women being too emotional."" the Good ol' boys club still exists and men will go out of there way to say hi to me while I'm walking to the fab (which is uncomfortable) I am not given the same opportunities as my male co-workers despite having 7 years experience as a mechanic. Intel can definitely work on getting rid of their complacent employee's.
Advice to Management
Do better about addressing sexism and people abusing their power's and being professional in the work place. minimalize hate speech towards different types of people.

Cut through the useless red tape! Make sure your talent is being efficiently put to use. Saying you have 1000's of Ph.D.'s working for you doesn't mean you have 1000's of Ph.D.'s doing sophisticated work for you.

You will learn a LOT.
they have a kudos program where you can be thanked by a coworker and you get money that the coworker didn't have to give you.
401(k) matching and SPP is pretty nice!
They give you learning subscriptions like Pluralsight, LinkedIn, and O'Reilly.
work/life balance is really good here due to bonding leave, and sabattical.
","They don't appreciate you at a corporate level.
promotions are few and far between.
raises are mediocre generally 1-3%.
When you own something here, you own it for life.
Very little room to grow and you are likely to stagnate because of the large corporate environment.
Advice to Management
Back up your values with money. Be sure to show fiscal appreciation to people who align with the company values. Don't let people stagnate in pay grade - Especially as you see their value to the company. Be sure to listen to the first line managers when determining promotions and raises - NOBODY knows the contributor and their contributions better than their manager.

It's a wonderful place to work and has an inclusive culture that I have not encountered at any other company. Everyone is willing to help newer people learn and become stronger as an organization. There is a focus on personal & career development through different job roles. It's a friendly, happy culture overall.

Within Operations, people tend to rotate to other roles every 2-3 years, which keeps things fresh. Job transitions are voluntary. There is a Great Place to Work team, comprised of volunteers that keeps things fun and interesting outside of work as well. Benefits & perks/discounts are quite nice and varied.

Having Pat (CEO) onboard is a breath of fresh air and his expertise will be needed for Intel to evolve to the next stage.
","Compensation is less competitive than what I had expected since I had relocated to the area, however the total package met my needs after some negotiation. Per labor statistics for the region I am in, Intel is competitive for compensation.

","Too many changes in top leadership in recent years have resulted in unreliable commitments to technology development. High focus on stock buy-backs and fiscal matters in lieu of engineering and technology investments. Top-level software leadership is very weak and lacks 'software' expertise, leaving the company with no strategy for software other than 'enablement' of its chip platforms. Pay and benefits are not competitive.
Advice to Management
Properly invest in your people and technologies; hyper-focus on operating margins and fiscal minutia (while sitting on mountains of cash) has stifled progress and innovation in important technology areas and killed initiative among the ranks.

The people you meet at Intel are some of the most skilled and innovative people I have met anywhere.
Intel's bonus structure is generous
","In my opinion,:
As a large company, one can become invisible if you are not continuously promoting yourself.
Intel, as with any large company has the usual bureaucracies which can become tiresome.
Intel bases performance on a continuously rising standard, so it can feel like incentives are a carrot-on-a-string sometimes.

","The day to day work was never ending, constantly high stress, with zero retrospectives to learn lessons. It was a reactive environment. If you tried to apply a lesson to the next project, you'd hear things like ""let's see if it's different this time."" Our team often wasn't included in plans which led to thrash. Nothing felt like a win, and I didn't leave each day proud of my work.

I was bullied and micromanaged by a manager above mine. I became afraid to do my job. I did not feel supported by my management team - I felt like the issues I brought up were brushed off. I do not feel HR took my report seriously or dealt with it in a timely manner.

","When there's conflict, Intel and management kind of throw their hands up and don't take any sides. You could be right, or wrong, usually doesn't matter.

2021-03-29, Hardware Engineer,"San Jose, CA",Former Employee,cog in a wheel,"Intel has good benefits with 3 weeks vacation per year to start and separate sick pay, and since 2020 a 401K plan as good as any out there with in-plan Roth conversion available and decent matching. They also have a 100% matching program for charitable donations.

As a large company you won't be running out of licenses for industry-standard tools and the vendor support staff will return your emails and calls.

After you've been in your position a year you can transfer internally and a few people do take advantage of this to get exposure to different areas of engineering or roles.
","As such a large company any person's experience is going to reflect the specific division and group they end up in. So I can only comment from what I saw. 

Pay is a bit low compared to peers. Younger engineers leaving after a few years at Intel get big raises but that's always been true in engineering; once you join just about any employer out of college you only get a few percent a year raises and its up to you to get a big jump by leaving after no more than 5 years at that first job (or at least get offers and see if your current employer will match, knowing you have to leave if they don't match) 

Intel uses a mix of industry standard tools and in-house ones. The staff is made up of people who have only been there a few years and lifers who joined out of college and have 20+ years at Intel. This has 3 consequences. First, using the in-house tools depends on tribal knowledge. To the extent documentation exists it will be filled with jargon such as project names and references to previous tools this one replaced. If you don't know what these were (and as a new hire you won't) then much of the documentation is useless. Second, change is hard because the people making decisions are often those with long tenure. They justify things with ""we've always done it this way"" because they are comfortable with the convoluted steps needed to configure and run the in-house tools and flows. Third, some (if not most depending on job assignment) of skills younger engineers learn at Intel have little to no value to employers not named Intel. There are people with 5+ years experience that have the same value to any other employer as a college grad, so they face a challenge if they want to look elsewhere. 

Intel has literally thousands of engineering positions and a person taking ownership of their career can build a wonderful resume that would make them an attractive candidate elsewhere in case there is a layoff or they decide to leave. Relatively few people do this however. A key lesson to understand at any large company is the only person looking out for your interests is you. This is especially relevant if all you're doing is running in-house tools and flows.

A surprising lesson is how much personal connections matter to getting your job done at Intel. Intel works on large chips and any person doing actual engineering work (as opposed to management) only is working on a small slice of the chip, usually just a few steps of the overall effort to design and integrate one of the many modules into the chip. You may be running timing, or verification, or placement, etc. So you'll need to work with other engineers to get the module in, especially when you have problems due to their work or vice-versa. My advice here is how critical it is to build a reputation of doing everything you can to help out when someone has a problem that may be from work you own. Eventually the tables will turn and you'll need help from others; they'll remember whether you helped them and their teammates or just tried to pass the buck when they needed you.

The fab needs to go to a normal production model. Operators (not ROC), Process Tech, and Equipment Maintenance.

Always do whats best for the employees, not just what they are asking for or even what they need. Yes, majority of employees don't need assistance in transitioning to working from home, but wouldn't it be appreciative if your company went above and beyond that?

","Grade system makes it impossible to apply for jobs where you have experience. System has bias built in. Example...if you are hired as a 7 you apply for jobs at a grade 6 or a 8...but chances are pretty good that if you are experienced when you are hired, you will be more experienced than people that have had their careers at Intel and are grade 9 or 10s...and there is no clear methods for getting promoted (grade change) as it is very manager dependent amd most managers have no idea how the system works. So be aware that grade matters for career growth and development if you are experienced and seek career opportunities at Intel.

Advice to Management
Pay employees more. Apple and Microsoft are poaching a ton of engineers and Intel is out giving inflation raises to engineers with good performance reviews. Intel will be torn apart, inside and out, by competitors unless Intel aggressively invests in itself.
I hear management say that “Intel is a big rich company, we’ll make it through”. You know who is 8 times larger and has better profit margins? The companies stealing your employees and known for giving tech employees 10x stock options compared to Intel.

When I started at Intel, the culture was very much about ‘meritocracy’ meaning the rewards were based on what you accomplished and the results you achieved.

2021-02-24, Field Sales Engineer,"Santa Clara, CA",Current Employee,Exciting and fulfilling with some of the same caveats you see everywhere,"Pros of any big company, with add-ons as Intel has lead the world in so many advancements. I will leave the normal pay / health care / retirement out of this as that is a personal decision that is so different for a 25 year old than it is for a 40 year old or a 50 year old. What I say on that subject would be largely irrelevant to many. Suffice to say I have been here 20+ years so it is good for me. What really keeps me at Intel is the technology we invent on a day to day basis. I truly believe we are doing things that change the world. We are not always first and not always the best at everything. But we keep going and what we put out had the opportunity to changes lives around the world. I love that. The people I work with have been amazing. They love what they do and their zest for the job is infectious - they make me want to be better.
","We are a big company and sometimes (almost always) it takes time to make changes. Sometime obvious changes are embarked upon slowly as it is hard to get 100K+ people to move in a new direction. The other issue I have, and this will not be a popular opinion probably, is that I feel that we have gone too far on diversity and inclusion. I am not against any diversity or inclusive activities. What I am against is having it thrown at me every day and tying my pay to it. There should not be bonus kickers that relate to diverse hiring - that is nothing I can control nor should it be there at all. I am still old school where you hire the best person for the job and then investigate why one manager seems to hire only 40 year old white male. Go after people that offend vs telling a manager a diverse candidate is the requirement when the non-diverse candidate is clearly the better choice. I have been on hiring panels where that was forced on me so no one can tell me it is not happening. I see Intel as having many of the same big company problems my friends and family have at their big companies. To me, the ""bad"" is pretty equal across the big companies so the good has to be what sways you.
Advice to Management
Put the best people in position to do the job and then get out of the way. Give decision making powers to the people doing the work - endless meetings kill the spirit.

","It is hard to be a fit for Intel, it is not for everybody, the ramp to be up to speed in a job could take even a year for what I have seen. And the other big Con I see are politics, I guess this happen in many companies, but it is really important to care about appropriate networking and internal communication, these 2 elements do not seem as negative elements to have, it just the importance of it versus the actual work performance what I see as Con.

","may be very team dependent, since it seems many people at Intel get away with doing nothing. I am choosing to leave after a year because my team works crazy hours, scheduling meetings at 10pm, working on the weekends, and pushing aggressive schedules when the issue is that the Intel environment and tools we use are just complete garbage so our efficiency is halved.

The whole company is a mess and I began looking for new jobs within half a year of joining. Management doesnt listen to concerns and the problems keep getting worse and not better. Intel chooses to pay important DA positions or support teams overseas instead of in your timezone, so if you ever need help you have to give up your evening to meet on their time. Stay as far away as possible. I was excited about a fairly high pay package for my level and field, but the costs are NOT worth it

","You will be seriously penalized and retaliated against if you are a top performer and show intention of changing group within intel. You are told explicitly that the only path forward to a promotion is if you don’t change groups even if you want to make a move within the same organization/group / technology. If you insist on to be considered for an open opportunity for which you will be a perfect fit you will be penalized and will have to “pay the price” . Immediate Managers have perfected the art so well that they will very connivingly start to undermine your contributions. If you get another opportunity within intel and your manager gets to know that they will actively undermine the transfer . If the new manager doesn’t pay heed your transfer will take place otherwise you will be stuck in your position with promotions constantly being used as a bargaining chip. This attitude has given me so much mental stress that I will not wish that on anyone .
Advice to Management
I wish there was a way to independently determine the year to year progress for a promotion. I wish a manager’s decision could be sent for review to an independent person who took employee’s best professional interests under consideration . The exploitation needs to end if we want to be a world class company. Most of us work very hard and do everything right but still are exploited by immediate managers .

2021-02-08, Demand Planner,"Hillsboro, OR","Current Employee, more than 5 years",Great experience in business groups,"I think the culture can be a little different (and maybe more grueling) in engineering functions, but I've found the culture to be very positive in business roles/groups. There is a focus on results/meritocracy, but also an emphasis on work-life balance and flexibility. When something comes up (home repair, illness, kids thing) all of my managers have been flexible and encouraging to take care of those things when needed (and don't need to take a vacation day to do it).
","Not much I can think of honestly - I really enjoy working at this company. Like any mega-company, there are a dizzying amount of org changes and new initiatives always to keep track of, but as far as Fortune 100 companies, it's a pretty great one to work for.

Respectful workplace. Overall, working with other engineers is a great experience. You can learn many technical details from different groups
","The promotion opportunities are minimal, and the managers care more about your length of employment than your contribution to the projects. Many managers lack technical knowledge, so they cannot provide any insight into the process development. Instead, you need to spend lots of time educating managers. Due to frequent changes of higher managers, many duplicate and unnecessary updates are requested from managers.
Advice to Management
Reward people who made a contribution, not the people who stay longer in the company. When you have no idea about the project, don't pretend that you understand it and provide opinions that slow down or derail the project.

","They fed cockroach on a plate. Driver intentionally runs over a puppy. VPs managers are obsessed about everything you do on your phone(they switch on the signal jammer near office so you are forced to use WiFi and they introduce malware which enables the hack). Managers have no respect for personal life even when someone’s loved one is dying from last stage of cancer. Worst people I’ve ever met in my life. Best decision I’ve made in life was to quit my job. Disrespectful managers who have no respect for people coming from diverse backgrounds. Manager has no interest in building your skills no ownership only blame game on junior engineers. Bullying mentality of seniors who are always frustrated which only shows their incompetence.

I think management is doing great. Intel is moving away from the old ways of working. It does still seem like Intel rewards individuals who work long hours, lose sleep, and do not have as much personal/free time. Though it does seem that Intel is trying to move away from this. Please make sure to drive the importance or work/life balance.

- Have always felt comfortable speaking up when a product is not going smoothly without fear of retaliation from management
","- Like any large company, sometimes you are restricted to explore outside of your current domain; you tend to fill a specific niche
- Progress upwards can be challenging as only 1-2 people on each team might get a sizeable pay bump / promotion each year
- Constant re-org changes; you build up rapport with a certain manager only to have them leave (tale of a big company)

","U.S.-based technical writers are non-exempt employees, so they are paid by the hour. For the most part it's not a big deal, but it can create some ""bean counting"" and excuse making with the writers. For example, I've seen writers use not being able to get overtime as an excuse to avoid a meeting scheduled in the evening when they could have just said something like, ""I'm not available at that time. Please take notes so that I can stay apprised of decisions and action items.""
Like many silicon design and fabricating companies, there's a strong emphasis on engineering skills which can leave people with other skill sets at a disadvantage (from a liberal arts background, for example), even if engineering skills are not what's required to be successful in a role.

2020-12-19, Remote Operations Technician,,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Worst job I've ever had. Never working for Big Tech ""leftist"" Corporations ever again.","The pay differential for working nights is decent. 401k is pretty good. Quarterly bonuses are usually pretty decent.
","Ever since the COVID-19 ""pandemic"" lockdowns and masking mandates, this company has been the most tyrannical and draconian I have ever experienced. I despise showing up to work ever since this started in March and every chance I get for lunch or break, I drive as far as possible whenever possible. Feels like a prison complex; no freedoms no fun, no nothing!

Horrid leadership that gets promoted based on their gender or skin color or sexual orientation to fill in the quotas; not based on actual experience. Disgusting. They treat disabled military vets like trash and place them in positions that are even worse for their disability. Been here for well over a year and have yet to see one single promotion irregardless of how hard I work.

Nightshifts are the worst: even on your days off, it is nearly impossible to transition to see daylight. Basically, your family life is non-existent if you are married or have children, or even desire to have a social life.

Training: non-existent. You get thrown in the deep end and basically try and figure it out on your own. If you make a mistake, you basically get chewed out and embarrassed before everyone.

Needless to say: actively searching for another position ASAP. Cannot wait to quit.
Advice to Management
Don't low-ball your recruits with false hopes of bonuses. Base pay should still be competitive. 

Don't promote inexperienced people into leadership roles just because of their gender or race or whatever: you are ruining the quality of your leadership and your company. Hire people based on experience, not silly degrees only. 

Stop treating healthy people as if they are all sick and forcing masking mandates, temperature checks, etc - we are adults and know how to take care of ourselves if we have the flu or any illness.

Stop cramming your leftist progressive agenda down everyone's throat. It is really upsetting and disgusting and not very ""inclusive"" of you.

Diversity & Inclusion - Commitment on leaderships part to ensure we are fully representative of diverse people and cultures, and dedication to ensuring we are at full pay parity for all of our employees. 
Compensation & Benefits - Outstanding and competitive compensation package with fantastic benefits. Intel is constantly evaluation and adding new benefits as the need arises, including a fantastic response to the pandemic in order for employees to work from home with all the tools they need. 
Leadership - Our leadership has remarkably stepped up and led us through this pandemic, ensuring those employees who must be onsite are safe and healthy. Additionally, they have made decisions over the course of the last year which are clearly in the best interests of the employees and it shows in their support.
","Lower level leadership doesn't listen very well to their employees. During organizational level sensing surveys, when it's obvious that there is a problem within the organization from the top down, the leadership often doesn't recognize it's stemming from them. This makes it difficult to illicit change from leadership when they refuse to accept their role in the concerns and so the problem persists. There is often a lot of bureaucracy which can really get in the way. Intel could use a lot of streamlining.

I have felt supported, encouraged, and developed when I was clear about my career goals. I have also been able to travel around the world and meet with coworkers in person. It doesn't sound like a big deal, but when you work with people for months at a time, it makes a huge difference getting to meet them in person, versus just on the phone.
","The company seems to have lost its focus over the years. There have been some amazing advancements, but they have come at a big cost. Culture, focus, direction all shake out from this. And when there is lack of clarity at the top, it snowballs all the way down the chain of command. This leads to burn out, lack of priority, inter organization threats and no unifying thread or purpose to tie employees together.
Advice to Management
Prioritize, prioritize, prioritize. If we are everything to everyone, then we are nothing to anyone. We don't need to do 100 things to be successful. We need to be fearless, pick the few key things that drive results, and commit to them and be supported when we say, ""no"".

2020-12-06, Software Engineer,,"Current Employee, more than 10 years",Typical enterprise and big company sadness,"Supposedly really good health insurance. 401k match (I believe), RSU (stock grants), bonuses, all that. Pay may or may not be competitive, see note below about inside of IT.

If you're female and especially a person of color, you'll have a really good chance of being hired, regardless of experience. The emphasis on diversity is strong. Years ago (before this recent push!) we were told that out of the candidates who applied, if we did not choose the woman, we had to justify that to a VP. A VP mind you that has no idea what we actually need. There used to be crazy large referral bonuses the more unique of a hire you could find. Get that koosh large company job, find a nice place to settle in and eventually become a manager that is simply just a warm body in a chair.
","The IT organization is mismanaged and horrible. Some of the main culture pillars include ""customer orientation"" and everything in IT goes against that. Nobody has faith when you're told to ""go to it.intel.com and submit a ticket"" that it's going to be done properly. The system doesn't allow for easy rerouting. It's full of third world support people shoving tickets around, not understanding the issues. Anything above ""can you turn it off and on again"" type stuff is an absolute joke. This same system is what everyone uses be it ""my laptop won't turn on"" to a huge advanced IT project's support. The lower tiers have no idea what those things are and usually the ticket is DOA.

Let's not forget the push to SAFe. What a joke! Our fearless CIO Paula introduced it as part of this ""digital transformation"" and it's been a slow burning dumpster fire. Classes forced on how the process is supposed to work (designed by an amazing third party vendor!) and then immediately thrown out because Intel wants to do things ""their way"" anyway. The consistent ""one size fits all"" approach coming from the top down (while simultaneously wanting us to ""be fearless"" and challenge the status quo and all that) stifles real innovation or ability to meet specific needs with the right solutions. I could go on for years, but they've done two rounds now of large amounts of IT layoffs in the last 3 years alone, and I've had 6 or 7 managers in that time. I did enjoy my job well enough for many years outside of IT. The company itself is known for high stress, in general. Add to that the IT organization's continuous desire to cut costs and eventually heads when there's no more costs to cut... why would you want to work there?

Also, funny tidbit - the IT organization pays less for the same exact job that is located elsewhere in the company. Not that any of those really exist, since geniuses at the top decided that everyone who does IT work should be in the IT organization. Remember: one size fits all. If it doesn't fit, it will eventually. Think square peg in round hole being jammed in there until one side breaks.

Another con, probably true of any large company - too many managers, too much management. We have new VPs every month. It's insane. We have the wrong people doing things all over the place. People who have no clue making certain decisions but are empowered to make them anyway. Or ""skilled"" labor that can't seem to even form a single thought. I don't know how some of these people can even find the bathroom without assistance.

When I was hired, I was given stock options. They expired before they were ever worth anything. Nowadays they issue RSUs for things, which are much better. But I was stuck getting absolutely nothing for my hiring ""bonus""

To summarize: this is not a place you want to work if you're going to be inside of the IT organization. Inside of a business group, sure, it can be alright. Manufacturing, sure. But IT? Run for the hills.
Advice to Management
Bring in someone who can manage the IT organization properly. Not the latest woman or woman of color who looks impressive to the board. (Nothing against women, but it feels like some of the management decisions are purely for a good public appearance.... nobody really brings a decent culture shift with them.)

Make sure management has the right credentials and don't come from another enterprise company. We just keep winding up with the same result over and over again. SAFe was a joke from the beginning, and nobody can honestly say that the company is functioning any better. The way the organization is setup needs to be redone, not compartmentalized, not dressed up with ""fun"" team names. If anyone outside the company watched the quarterly planning meetings they'd think it was a more boring version of Office Space. All the output from it winds up being a long list of dependencies on different teams, but no real way to resolve them. Instead of having dependencies amongst compartmentalized teams, how about having teams made up of the that appropriate resources aligned together? I understand that is scary from a cost efficiency standpoint, but I guarantee it will be more efficient long term.

Also, each round of layoffs winds up leaving large craters in tribal knowledge and impact. They don't seem to have any rhyme or reason to who is chosen, and many teams and customers are going to suffer. Nobody is being backfilled properly. I've seem my team reduced to half its size naturally with no effort to backfill with appropriate resources, just interns. The obsession with keeping headcount low is sad. There is zero feeling of any sort of loyalty. I know long term Intel people who are considering looking elsewhere and bringing their knowledge with them. Very key and critical people. They don't want to be blindsighted by the next round of layoffs.

The way the organization is setup needs to be redone, not compartmentalized, not dressed up with ""fun"" team names. If anyone outside the company watched the quarterly planning meetings they'd think it was a more boring version of Office Space. All the output from it winds up being a long list of dependencies on different teams, but no real way to resolve them. Instead of having dependencies amongst compartmentalized teams, how about having teams made up of the that appropriate resources aligned together? I understand that is scary from a cost efficiency standpoint, but I guarantee it will be more efficient long term.

Also, each round of layoffs winds up leaving large craters in tribal knowledge and impact. They don't seem to have any rhyme or reason to who is chosen, and many teams and customers are going to suffer. Nobody is being backfilled properly. I've seem my team reduced to half its size naturally with no effort to backfill with appropriate resources, just interns. The obsession with keeping headcount low is sad. There is zero feeling of any sort of loyalty. I know long term Intel people who are considering looking elsewhere and bringing their knowledge with them. Very key and critical people. They don't want to be blindsighted by the next round of layoffs.

- Lots of interns to interact with.
- Can meet with anyone in the company at the request of a 1 on 1. Don't waste managers or CEO's time though.
","- No job placement for many internships. It's all on you to find another group resulting in self directed job hunting within the company. Even if you do find something within the company, it can easily be taken away.
- How much you get out of the experience highly depends on the group you are in and who you work with.
- Noticeable difference in how direct full-time employees and contractors are treated, despite that they work side by side with each other and many things overlap between their job duties.
Advice to Management
Help Interns land jobs, or connect them with hiring managers. Interns aren't just cheap labor (compared to employees), they are people that took the internships for a potential future career at Intel. If you don't have a potential job lined up for an intern to take, then don't offer an internship, and let them work for a different group that does.

2020-11-28, Technical Director Mod & Integration Yield Eng,"Hillsboro, OR","Current Employee, more than 1 year",Improving. Cross company integrity and direction needs improvement,"Working with smart, highly skilled and competent individuals is very satisfying when designing and executing projects. Messaging about work-life balance, diversity, inclusion and results seems to come from the right place even if not always the reality, although I do appreciate their effort to create inclusive company language on official documents. Benefits are very good and most managers are flexible on off time after covering weekend or night time projects. 

Good training opportunities for the most part, good ergonomic programs, and good pay. Skype meetings are at least 2X as effective as old in person meetings.

Most people are open to answer questions or help train you on certain items. This saves a lot of time.

Since covid start, direction and decision making seems to have improved. Not sure if this is from increased company cohesion or from Engineers and management not being as exhausted when making decisions.
","Low integrity between modules and with some upper management to mid level managers, sometimes questionable data is requested to be “modified”. Pressured to hide data or not confront easily predicted excursions until upper management prioritizes the item after excursion occurs. Lots of time wasted on unnecessary items that are company wide not module specific priorities that leave little time for more important development items. Surprisingly, more then you would think # of instances of coworkers referring to colleagues as slurs(like universally considered bad ones), calling out of problem is ignored, there seems to be a reason Intel has issues retaining certain demographics.

Ability to call out root cause issues seems to be primarily determined by seniority opposed to robustness of model. Issues and solutions are sometimes investigated in this same manner leading to lots of time wasting. Not all managers willingly share data or reasons behind certain decisions that affect your area or ability to close on items. Usually they are experienced enough where this is not an issue, but sometimes bad calls are made since no one has the big picture and data sharing can be limited. 

One should expect to work nights and weekends for project items routinely. This is not for everyone but a required part of the job.
Advice to Management
Request increased truth and transparency from managers. Sometimes questionable data gets presented to meet timelines, where the experiment/test really needs to be repeated to validate. Might be better for managers+engineers to own up when presenting data that is not iron clad or report preliminary data.

","While an employee in their Technology Manufacturing Group, I reported another employee for assaulting someone only to see the assaulter face little or no recourse. Furthermore, in mid-January 2020, as a vendor for another company, I was given 24 hours of notice to handle an escalation in China. This was at the onset of the COVID-19 epidemic. Intel didn't inform me of any virus before I traveled yet, upon my arrival, all of the China-based Intel employees were fully aware of a virus. I was not supplied any safety equipment and no preventative measures were instructed while on Intel's campus. After leaving China for safety concerns and returning to work in America, two of my coworkers displayed COVID-like symptoms a week later. This behavior is outright reckless and negligent! Assaulting people should not be tolerated and safety is Intel's self-proclaimed top priority. How can they miss such a huge oversight?

2020-11-18, Mechanical Technician,"Hillsboro, OR","Current Employee, less than 1 year",Strangest Job I've Ever Had - Extremely Poor to No Communication and I am Paid to do Nothing,"1) Intel's benefit package is a bit above average: medical, vision, dental, lawyer on retention, 401k 4% match, commuter benefit, HSA, FSA, Dependent Care Assistance Program, EAP, adoption assistance, education reimbursement, and on site amenities like a gym, a vision clinic, a bank, a mobile dental office, a massage studio, a mother's room, multiple cafes (currently serving free meals due to COVID), and free shuttle buses. There is also profit sharing, bonuses, and other financial incentives which can add multiple thousands of dollars to your annual salary/wage.

2) Employee performance isn't punitive in nature and meant to empower improvement through transparency - meaning that at every manager 1:1 session you're shown how you're doing and talk about it so there's no surprises at the end of the year review. 

3) There are employee resources for help if there are issues - like a warmline for staff to talk about work-related issues and come up with a plan with the warmline to help the issue(s) to improve. (note that you need to know these exist and how to find them) 

4) There are various employee career improvement/development programs like a buddy and a mentorship program (note that you need to know these exist and how to find them).
","The biggest issue I've had is that I was hired, given an initial training called their NEO program, which we were told to hurry through online, and then I've been sitting with nothing to do for months since. It took me a week and a half to figure out who my manager was & my manager wasn't responsive when emailed. It took me weeks to figure out if I was supposed to be doing something, and when I ran out of tasks that I figured out, I've been trying desperately to make my own work since. I'm someone that thrives on staying busy, and this has been very hard for me. I have contacted everyone that I can think of, like HR and their Warmline, for help & so far change is not happening. Additionally:

1) It's extremely difficult to get hired at Intel as they get their ""pick of the litter"" due to their reputation and name. It took me multiple years of applications to get in.

2) Communication in general is very poor and I don't know enough to know who to report poor communication to or how/where to look to find answers.

3) Intel's outsourced their general IT and HR to 3rd parties, and this has so far not only resulted in appalling customer service but leaves me with no avenues to report poor service to since they don't mention who they report to or what agency/agencies they are. 

4) You are completely on your own to figure out everything at Intel. No one tells you anything. 

5) Intel (for reasons I understand) is very abbreviation and acronym heavy, and unfortunately, the internal vocab definition site is extremely lacking, so most jargon goes over my head and I have no resources to help me understand them. 

6) Management appears to have no idea you even exist. I have no idea who my co-workers are as well.

7) As a former contractor, this one bothers me a lot - there is definitely a caste system at Intel between the ""green badges"" (temps/contractors), ""ice blues"" (employees with a defined employment term), and the ""blues"" (employees). It's dreadful. I watch the ""green badges"" get yelled at and talked down to by the blue badges, and some people won't talk to you without you sharing the same badge color.
Advice to Management
1) Have a much more robust new employee hiring process that pairs you with a buddy from day 1 (this is apparently supposed to happen but didn't happen at all with me) so that you can learn about Intel and how to do your job.

1A) Have a robust checks and balances system in place to make sure this is happening. 

2) 1:1 meetings with your manager should happen by far more often than once every few months when you're first hired. 

2A) Have a robust checks and balances system in place to make sure this is happening. 

3) There should be a robust website with jargon defined so that new employees don't feel lost and left out during team meetings.

4) There should be multiple levels of communication expected - like co-workers introducing themselves, managers sending out team emails and having team meetings on a regular basis, and higher level managers reporting via emails and meetings on a less frequent but still regular basis.

5) A check-in system with new hires to make sure things are going well vs. leaving them completely adrift like myself. I've lost a lot of respect that I've had for Intel and have felt completely demoralized and discouraged from being ignored for months. 

6) I've had a few examples of a ""hurry up and wait"" environment as well - like there are web based trainings that you have to do in a specific time frame, but they're not relevant to your job (from what I can tell) & then there's nothing to do until training will suddenly pop up that's due very quickly again. I've also been told that I'm behind my peers, whoever they are, and that's frustrating because I'm given no guidance and limited training. I think that any ""hurry up and wait"" model should be re-examined - trainings should be proactive, not reactive in nature.

-Everybody knows the name Intel, it will look great on a resume
-Low stress except around predictable times of the year (usually back to school and christmas, although this depends where your place is in the design flow)
-I loved my team and felt like I was part of a family. Everyone was very nice and helpful
","-Personally I could feel the effects of brain degradation during my 3 years there. I left a dumber person than when I entered
-They seem actively discourage learning outside your one area of expertise
-Much lower starting salary than competing companies
-Innovation is discouraged on certain teams because they already have a way of doing things
-Corporate will routinely fire people for no reason. You are a number to them. The hierarchy of the company is much too large for any sort of relationship between corporate and their engineers
-Less perks than similar tech companies
-Poor communication between different teams
Advice to Management
-Work together with other teams more. Encourage cross-learning. I always felt a sense of disdain coming from the other teams we worked with. We are all part of the same company, and should act as such.
-Stop firing people for stupid reasons. Less head-assery in general.

","Zero work-life balance. They will push you beyond your breaking point and take anything they can. The politics are terrible. They are known for being very ethical, but the truth is the culture is to hide what isn’t ethical. Legal instructs people to not put things in writing so they can’t be sued. This kind of mentality leads to hiding the truth and creating groups that watch each other’s back. So lots of unethical treatment occurs, including sexual harassment and workplace bullying.

","Inexperienced leader and managers who struggle to manage the team and work. There is no work life balance , roles are poorly created and conversion to full time roles/promotion depends upon your rapport with your manager than your work. There is no transparency in the system, no empathy for the team members and unnecessary processes add to stress
Advice to Management
Hire good leader and managers who can manage work and the people in their team else you will see a lot of good people leaving the organization. Many of them have already left due to all the issues they were facing.

Advice to Management
Instead of doing stock buy backs focus on retaining talented employees, fixing the process and product as AMD/NVIDIA have a plan and they been executing flawlessly and on time. Quotas of hiring URM's is not good for the company as people will focus on hiring people based on the outside not what they are qualified to do based on more money on hiring bonuses based on if they are a URM or not. I would say disband the board and get folks that know the semi-conductor business. Too many finance and medical folks on there.

Advice to Management
Focus on providing a good growth potential for your employees. do not try to fill roles just for formality rethink if you really need people to do those jobs. there are many ppl at Intel who are clueless as to what they have to do. Senior leadership does not know what its strengths and weaknesses are even within its core engineering teams. their strategies to handle attrition are so archaic and useless.

- you will work with really smart people
","- It is an up or out environment in the finance organization
- Front line managers were eliminated such that if you are not very senior you will not be a manger. The biggest problem with this approach is the managers don't know and or don't remember how to do the jobs of the junior and senior analysts.
- Most of the work that you would cut your teeth on and grow with the company has been outsourced to (LCG) Low-Cost Geographies. Thus there is no foundational knowledge to be gained as to how to really get into the core FP&A skills.
- Given it is up or out, you are in direct competition with both your peers and your manager. Each manager in your organization will want to know about what you are doing and as much as possible claim it as something they thought of, directed, led etc... so that they can claim in as an accomplishment on their yearly review. (FOCAL)

There used to be ""GPTW"" - Great Place To Work, a program that added a lot of extra value to employees and even their families. It was cut to save money.

Intel has been successful despite management's best efforts. Moore's law and the high barriers to entry have kept other companies from entering the CPU business. Moore's law will end, and ARM based processors will enter the server market. When they do Intel will be in for a big challenge.

Bob Swan has done a lot to move the corporation in the right direction. He has trimmed a lot of fat. However, in cutting the fat he cut a lot of people who were the ones that just got things done. They knew what to do, how to do it and they did it.

Advice to Management
Be upfront and truthful to your employees, Stop beating around the bush and trying to play politics. If you are trying to destroy the company before TSMC/Samsung or any others takes over tell the workers well in advance so they can prepare for the lay offs and job searches

Listen to, supply and help the People on the floor, more than the people trying to stay relevant in the offices. You are a diamond currently not a pyramid. Too much in the middle, nothing at the base 

Make a perfect chip, Stick to it, if you improve it make it the next model (You are Intel, GO BIG or don't do it), stop adding Pluses, Your competition is real good at one chip, then learns from it, then makes another chip with all the upgrades and improvements with a NEW name, not a plus, then repeats process

","The facilities group (Corporate Services) is not ran like a facilities operation. Too much bureaucracy at the technician/worker level. Political. Finger pointing and blame games rather than real problem solving. Too much emphasis on irrelevant data than keeping the factory running. Until it isn't running. Too much unnecessary stress. Repercussions of mistakes results in employees not performing their duties and pushing work onto others. Terrible employee review process that is largely based upon whether it's your turn (negative or positive outcome). Pre-determined quota of bad reviews to be handed down to employees. Small 1-2 percent raises regardless of employee review rating. An excellent review (few and far between) does not equal a good raise. Majority of knowledgeable employees forced to retire, fired, or quit. Too much carrot dangling. Highly unqualified system owners with no experience. No trust in employees from management. No trust of management from employees. Continuously being thrown under the bus. Little credit for quality work. Lots of credit for being a self promoting meeting extender. Low pay for experienced workers. Unable to higher qualified employees. Too many managers. Too much emphasis on improving processes that work, which results in system impacts and wasted money. .
Advice to Management
Fix the cons mentioned above. Remove the management, the factory continues to runs smoothly. Remove the technicians and field engineers... not so much. How many impacts happen on holidays and weekends when management is not forcing unnecessary changes (improvements?) to systems?

2020-08-10, Senior Mask Designer,"Hillsboro, OR","Former Employee, more than 10 years","A great place to work, for those that are driven.","The primary ""Pro"" is the people. In addition to being a highly intelligent and motivated group, there is a real sense of community and a sense that every one around you wants to see you succeed. This is due at least in part to a strong corporate culture, which the upper management seems to take seriously. 

Also, you know that you are working on the design and production of cutting edge technology that we all use daily, which makes it easy to be proud of the work that you are doing.
","After working 20+ years on Intel design teams, I can tell you that burn-out is a real issue. While the culture is great at keeping people motivated and happy doing their work, it might be working a little too well. It's common for people to work long hours for extended periods of time and to not take their full allotment of vacation time. To their credit one of the Intel benefits is a sabbatical every four to seven years, but it's common for people to push those out as far as they can due to an underlying pressure to perform.
Advice to Management
Upper management seems to do a great job at keeping the company competitive and productive, but that takes a toll on people over time. More attention needs to be paid to the over all well being of it's greatest asset.

Advice to Management
There are decision makers in the company who have single-handedly cost the company billions over the last decade. Ask your engineers what decisions have been made over the last decade that hurt their productivity most, and trace those decisions back to their origins. There are people who keep making the same poor decisions that repeatedly impact the productivity of hundreds of engineers', and we just keep letting them do it again and again.

It's clear that they care about giving interns the best experience possible as they keep connecting us with more and more people, not only to learn about the company but also to advance our owns careers. From the start, my manager made it clear that not only are we here to work as interns, the goal of the program is to learn as much as possible of what we want from our own careers, as well as what Intel has to offer. Everyone is supportive every step of the way and will take time out of their day to help you and teach you. They have great values and a great culture.

","This position depends a lot on your shift. You may get lucky and be on a shift were everyone contributes or you may be on the shift that no one wants to be. Management does not care about your breaks since and they will be demanding for more and more... you need to know when to STOP overworking if not they will take advantage from you by being a hard worker. Saying so... the better you become the most likely they will NOT approve your vacations because guess what? they are always short on people so since you are a valuable asset for the company (since you do more than average people) they will excuse on the fact that there are not enough qualified people as you. As I said before it depends a lot on the shift, if you get lucky you may be on a decent shift that would allow you to grow but at the same time they will respect your breaks/lunch but if not well... you know what to expect. I have been on both sides and trust me you do NOT want to be in a bad shift but if you are new to intel you will not be able to tell so do your research if you know someone inside before accepting the job unless you like to be under a lot of pressure.

2020-07-13, Senior Software Engineer,"Hillsboro, OR","Former Employee, more than 10 years","Some good SW experience, but it was time to leave for a real SW career","Stable company, good benefits, its actually pretty cool to take the Intel Air Shuttle for career/customer meetings, there are good depts out there at Intel to work at. 

I worked in Storage, NAND/Optane storage, and it was a very good experience- the dept ran like it's own company, lots of opportunity, esp in Linux SW design projects. At one point the storage dept was projected to ship more silicon than Intel's CPUs which is crazy.
","red tape, tech growth a little muddled, IT laptop support still all Windows (hello, macOS and Linux laptops anyone), there are bad depts out there to make u miserable.

The storage dept got relocated to the Aloha campus, which is a campus where basically engineering growth (esp SW) dies because lets face it- the Jones Farm, Hawthorne Farm and Rhonler Acres is where all the RandD is happening and you are on your your own forgotten island at Aloha (Intel's first Oregon building).

Also, at the end of the day, if you really want a modern career in SW, you'll need to leave the company. Intel is not a SW company though there is SW work; however it's really hard to find the latest and greatest SW opportunities at Intel. I started realizing the danger of me becoming obsolete in the SW industry when I attended a few external conferences. I was also severely underpaid as a SW design engineer and had to get a few external offers (one I obviously eventually took) to prove to management what I thought I was worth was true, especially since I was doing the role of 1.5-2 heads (design + QA).
Advice to Management
Don't want to lose a valuable SW engineer? Pay attention to SW price market. Support more SW career growth and projects and don't trap SW engineers on concentrating on their powerpoint skills as they become more senior- they should still get some SW opportunities with their veteran experience.

Advice to Management
Management has done a fantastic job trying to fix issues with upward transparency so that everyone has at least some exposure to broader level BU plans. They should continue this effort for OneIntel. 
There is still too much variation between managers. I've had managers that not only have zero clue how to effectively manage a large team and project and actively point fingers to other Intel teams, but also give zero attention to professional growth. I've also had managers that land on the complete other end of this spectrum, being true leaders while fostering individual development. Managerial hiring should become more stringent. 

The effort for transparency should also extend into pay as well. The canned ""Depends on the budget"" and ""Hard to say"" manager-playbook responses when asking about promotions and pay raises seem to be reflecting in the growing attrition rate.

2020-06-04, Senior Technical Writer,"Portland, OR","Current Employee, more than 5 years","Challenging, but the right kind of challenging","The near-infinite complexity of the product itself and the scale of the organization make for a highly challenging workplace. Fortunately, the managers and engineers I've worked with are smart, knowledgeable, and driven by a sincere desire to make cool products. Very few managers are ego-driven overachievers, and staff across the organization are approachable and helpful. Also, the commitment to diversity and inclusion is palpable, and is driven by the highest levels of the organization. As a result, project teams and cafeterias look like the United Nations General Assembly (if the U.N. had hipsters with tattoos and piercings), and the glue that holds it all together is the desire to do good work. It probably helps that the competition for market share is fiercer than it has been in a long time.
","Sometimes it's hard to work in such a large organization. Sometimes the complexity of it all is hard to deal with. It's always hard to see worthwhile initiatives and innovative products not quite make it into reality.
Advice to Management
Always try to help line staff see the bigger picture in terms of technologies and the market landscape. That gets lost down in the trenches, but it's necessary to give our jobs meaning.

Trying to manage balancing the excessive workloads while being under our working time limits was a constant struggle.

Uncalled for because this is not primary school and everyone is a working adult. Only able to use during lunchtime and must be on the dot exact lunchtime or else they will escalate to management.
Must wear white button down collared shirt and black pants or black skirt and black shoe - Like a banquet uniform, tho office environment - No flexibility . because have to pack shipments and etc not comfortable at all. 

Cannot be in toilet for more than 5 mins or they would escalate.. 

Will have to cover for shortage of manpower for months. 2 person workload. 

Pay very low for the workload done. When voiced out they usually talk their way out of it. 

Every small thing that happens would turn into an escalation with the JLL management. 

They would check CCTV on what you are doing , if you are late abit or they feel you are lying. Really uncalled for. Like as though being stalked.

They would not recognize you if there are compliments or good feedback in from employees, they ignore them and pick on how you should improve more "". 

They ask a lot of questions when you are unwell and need to take MC. 
Same goes for Annual leave.

Advice to Management
If you want to keep skilled people in jobs, don't make them compete for money. That only helps one kind of person, the aggressive, type A people. Do you really want a company made up of one type? Also, Don't try to BS all these smart people about what you're really doing. We know you're greedy. We like our jobs, but straight-up lying to our faces every year doesn't make us feel very loyal.

","Most corporate operations groups range from utterly useless to straightforward malicious. 
* Building management ignores requests for adequate air conditioning where everyone is forced to wear sweaters. When you look up hundreds of similar requests in the system from different employees which were ignored, they start running around checking things out, in the end not doing anything to resolve the situation.
* Trying to put your group's product online using company network is virtually impossible, as they will demand insurmountable amount of documentation, dragging the whole process for months, finally denying your request. Save yourself time and heartbreak, and go with ""shadow"" IT hosting like AWS.
* Part of IT support and certain operations are based offshore with totally clueless and lazy personnel, who will ignore your requests to save your data, until it passes the expiration date and becomes unrecoverable.
* Open space office surrounded by conference rooms and phone booths where people yell on top of their lungs all day, making your workday miserable.

You are the bureaucracy, you are the problem, and that is the root of the whole system in your company, everything else is a direct result of management that doesn't care about anything.

","Bureaucracy, flow of information is siloed (need to know basis), layers of middle management, HR is ineffective, coworkers choose to escalate issues instead of speaking to you first, easy to get lost in the corporation, Intel way vs. real world application
Advice to Management
Get to know your employees and treat them as individuals with passions and goals instead of ignoring them and forcing them to find information on their own. Information should be shared with your team, whether it’s good or bad. Your employee is your biggest asset so they need to be treated with respect and autonomy. 

Limit the number of approval processes to senior management. Bureaucracy is not efficient and slows down processes for no reason.

Create a work environment where employees collaborate with each other instead of bulldozing each other for promotions and raises. A positive work environment is collaborative, innovative and equitable. A positive work environment allows employees to ask questions and not feel shamed to seek help.

Human Resources does not protect the employee or offer any valuable insight when there are problems. If there are issues between you and your management chain, you’ll be advised to document your communication and save emails.

The culture transition isn't working in PTD. Go back to the drawing board.
Continue increasing headcount. It's the only way to improve work-life balance while keeping pace in a competitive industry.
Weekend task force meetings result in burnt out engineers making bad decisions 7 days/week. Get rid of them and make a serious effort to reduce the 24/7 demands of the job. Sleep and time away from work is vital for productivity and problem solving.

2020-02-14, Manufacturing Equipment Technician,"Hillsboro, OR","Current Employee, more than 1 year","Solid good place to work, but not without its faults","Good pay, stable, and they want you to succeed at your job. Great benefits (401k, health insurance is actually *good* and you have options for cheap vs my last 5 employers).
Safety first and always in actual practice. 
A place where innovation is encouraged and known/calculated risks are taken. The sky is the limit for what we do, and that's recognized in day to day conversations.
There is an effort for more teamwork in small workgroups and people really do try to appreciate different backgrounds.
Going above and beyond is recognized often, and seems to be rewarded.
","It isn't a different planet, and you still get employees in who are more trouble than anything, and slackers. 
People who very obviously need to get fired tend to be there a very long time before they are sent off, even when their problems are gratuitous.
Management is not living and breathing the in-factory environment, and is a little (not a lot) disconnected, but they are responsive.
Hand-tools are a godawful mess. 
The recent reorganization has made things messy, which can be very very frustrating sometimes, but that isn't attributed to your own personal failing.
Hard to get into engineering positions without a Masters or PhD.
Advice to Management
Assign full-time project managers - stop having people add in additional tasks. It takes far too long for things to be fixed/updated. Things that could be done in a week with a dedicated project manager get dragged out for 3-6 months instead.
Get in the factory and tag along or check in with technicians in person once in a while. 
Plan more before diving into changes. Specifically, the reorganization had foreseeable challenges that could have been mitigated before changes went live rather than as fires to be put out afterwards.
And could we please have 2-ply toilet paper rather than the awful public restroom stuff we have now?

","There is absolutely no regard for work/life balance, to the point where supervisors tell their supervisees that the key to success is to sleep less so you can work more. The workplace culture is toxic, and the job is not as advertised. You're expected to be reachable 24/7, even in the middle of the night and on weekends (including scheduling regular meetings on Sunday mornings), and thus can never escape.
Advice to Management
Hire more people so the work is more manageable - 60-80++ hours/week is unhealthy, even for those without families - and so people don't need to be on call 24/7. Rein in your supervisors and hire people with a regard for their employees' happiness, both within the workplace AND AT HOME. And for goodness sake, let employees go home and log off! This stuff isn't life or death, so please stop treating it as such.

2020-01-25, Engineer,"Folsom, CA","Former Employee, more than 5 years","Great place to start your career and end your career, not so great in the middle","* Plenty of learning opportunities, especially for starting out in your career.
* Easy to switch groups and try new things.
* Great work culture, especially among engineers. The thing I miss most about my time at Intel was the people I worked with. 
* Some very talented people to learn from.
* Reasonable compensation (not super competitive, but average-ish) depending on location. Avoid the Bay Area location, unless you aren't planning on staying long term.
","* Highly political, especially as you get more seniority in the company. Some groups are worse about this than others. Towards the end of my stint at Intel, most of my week was spent in meetings trying to manage expectations, reporting on workflow efficiencies / inefficiencies to management, and arguing with other teams on behalf of my team.
* Raises and promotion are not truly merit based; your success in the company depends on being on the right projects, in the right groups, and being able to sell yourself to management.
* There are some truly great engineers at Intel. However, in larger organizations at Intel, management tends to try and fill positions as quickly as possible (or risk losing headcount). This results in there being a lot of engineers that don't have the skill set needed to do their jobs well, which can be very frustrating.
* Numerous 'big personality' types at Intel. These are usually very senior and principle engineers that have been in organizations for a while. They are easy to identify; their names will come up in conversations when discussing new ideas, usually in fear that the 'big personality' will come down from their high altar in the mountains and smite anyone that doesn't conform. Often these people bring little value to the organization, but they've managed to hold the organization hostage due to their long term presence and 'wisdom'.
Advice to Management
Try to reduce the ridiculous amount of politics. Make the people who keep everything running actually feel appreciated. The trend that I have seen is that the talented individuals get fed up and inevitably leave, and the less competitive engineers are the ones that stay long term. Management should try to reverse that.

","The company currently has at least two CFOs and no CEO. CEO of Intel needs to be a position occupied by a person who has a technology vision for the future, and who is inspiring enough to rally the company to get there. Not a CFO. Also, company appears to be a mode of not wanting long-term employees and instead hiring outsiders only, outsiders that do nothing but talk down to long-time Intel employees. Not good. Not necessary. Not right. We need fresh insights. We need outside talent to come in. But, we can do that AND respect our past - AND respect the people who built this company. I find it interesting how Intel spent 50 years building an innovation, profitability and manufacturing powerhouse, taking on and beating every almost every competitor. Intel prints profit. Yet, now we think it’s a sound strategy to hire the technology and business leaders from the companies whose tails we kicked for 50 years to come in and tell us how to do things right? Say that out loud and see if that makes sense.

Advice to Management
Bob Swan removed the “Great Place to Work” organization which would provide free tickets to local events inclusive of your family. Truly put Intel above other companies and you could say it cared about you outside of work. But Bob has made it clear he’s cash cowing Intel, collect his bonus, then leaving. CEO and CFO are more focused on the stock price than the culture. But leaders who grew up through Intel put the employees first.

","The company is dealing with a great numbers of awful and inexperience managers some do not even have any technical background to be leading a technical group in the first place. If you have found a great manager my best advice is to stake with him and maybe not change group till you are sure where you will land. There is a lot of gossiping going on at the work place mainly the style of management create such hostile work environment. Some groups at Intel become like gangsters to get admission is to state your loyalty to the manager and their own culture while the company policy dictate another. My experience is HR is not to be trusted, they are not helpful just a bunch of bureaucrats looking for their next pay check. If you are ever in a dilemma with a manager better look for a new job in a new group. Overall do not trust anyone nor any manager let's time be your ally, then you can let your guard down and that is after 3 years of working with them.

2019-12-29, Staff Software Engineer,Bangalore,"Former Employee, more than 5 years",Change is the only constant !!,"Most of the reviews are a reflection of a particular business group, leadership or manager. I have worked with 5 different managers from 3 different geographies, so I guess I can rate it well: 
- Fantastic work culture, very employee-friendly, human, sensitive and responsible. 
- An amazing pool of talented people, across the world. International exposure is amazing. 
- If you are a part of a COE (centre of excellence), you would be working on cutting-edge technology. 
- Ample infrastructure, like dev machines, HW, SW, and lab space (of course on a justifiable basis) 
- Most of the managers are encouraged not to micro-manage and connect with people well. 
- Huge office space (In Bangalore at-least), open areas, Gym, multiple cafeterias, good food. 
- If you are a good performer, you will enjoy a good salary and benefits.
- This is far better a place than it feels from outside news and talks about it.
","- Very (very) slow in decision making, due to huge beaurocracy levels. It seems impossible to put everyone on the same page. 
- People on the Technical ladder feel powerless/unheard after a particular level, and its extremely difficult to convey a change to the top levels.
- Business decisions related to a product mostly come from top-bottom, and execution teams have very little say. If you have a moron at the top, as an architect, forget about logical work distribution.
- Slow growth at higher levels, you are expected to please everyone to move up, without being a threat to anyone. 
- Too much duplication of work across the world. Many business groups and product teams do the same, what COE does, maintaining their codebase in several different places and tools, causing an absolute waste of time for everyone. 

Overall, if you have an appetite for aggressive growth, or you want to contribute big in business/product, you might not find this to be an exact match. But if you want a steady and constant growth with very good work-life balance, this is the place for you.
Advice to Management
- Changes are good for the company, many changes show that the company is trying hard to pick up velocity, but too frequent and too many changes mostly indicate chaos. We have an insider joke among techies ""The area in which Intel does its maximum RnD is Org-restructure"". 

- After doing a change, stick to it, back it up for a few years to show it was not an impulse buy by some immature leader. Do not just open huge business groups, to close it down next year. Set your priorities straight.

2019-12-24, Engineer,"Portland, OR","Current Employee, more than 10 years",16 Years at Intel,"Big company with many opportunities. There are lots of smart people. Good training opportunities.
","Lack of integrity of the management. Intel benefits look good on paper but are not honored by middle management. Intel has a crisis culture that burns people out. The internal bureaucracy is mind boggling and often costs vast amounts of time for the simplest tasks. The work spaces are loud and there is limited janitorial staff. IT services make the DMV look efficient. Work days are filled with useless meetings during which most employees ignore the topic to send email. Public humiliation is considered good leadership by management.
Advice to Management
Honor your benefits packages for vacation and respect FMLA labor laws. I sadly found out that these policies are not worth anything since middle management does not honor these policies and senior management does not value its people. Treat your employees like they matter instead of disposable equipment.

After 16 years I left for a better culture and better pay. I would not consider returning to Intel unless the dysfunctional corporate culture is corrected.

Facilities are excellent (thank you corporate services!)

I do like the Agile changes in the last few years - as long as we stick to the basic concepts & not complicate it with Intelized project management. (Please no more scrummerfall)

Challenging and interesting work most of the time. People are mostly focused on making things better. High quality employees to work with & lower quality ones are more obvious (in a good way) than they were in years past. This really helps morale.
","There are still many low quality managers in IT. Too many processes in IT to count which makes us slow & not able to respond to internal customers. 

Leadership only focuses on escalations and not what isn't on fire at the moment. There are many very complex areas of IT that are held together by long term employees. No these jobs cannot be outsourced without major impact to internal and external customers. Only outsource where it makes COMPLETE sense. 

Too many early and late meetings due to cross site/country teams - APT's should all sit in one country please. 

IT has been measuring their success mostly based on cost and much less on quality. We are there to support our business groups and enable their work, lower quality and slllooooow moving is hindering them. They are laughing at us when we say we are now ""world class"". I don't blame them.
Advice to Management
IT management - PLEASE no more processes! And as a PM I like Agile! 

Pick a better PM tool that is not just web based (with no mobile - really? I could get a lot done on the fly if I could access user stories on my phone) and that integrates into O365 apps / MS Teams, etc. Rally is an abomination. 

Put a ton more money into deploying O365 / exchange online and other basic office tools - we are behind other companies and it's embarrassing. 

Managers in your infrastructure group should focus on their entire team's responsibilities, not just the escalations ""squeaky wheels"". Many things are being held together with duct tape and gum - with no escalations right now. Look forward and strategize for the future of your teams. 

For grade 8 and below - managers should really be in the same country (or at least overlapping time zone) as the employee. It's not about ""independence"" it's about being able to get to know your employees. 

Also can you please hire more of our US green badges to blue? This used to be a very good path for some people but the practice has not been supported as much for many years. The GB's integrate soooo much faster.

","The work was dreadful. It was really boring and not at all challenging or cutting edge. There are times where you will be confused why you seniors are getting paid much more than you when it doesn't seem like they are doing much more work. It was tough to get modern software development practices in such an old company a lot of things were legacy and basics like Agile was considered groundbreaking... 
Promotions and rewards not based merely on merit. It also depends on seniority so you will have to wait your turn to promote.
Base pay was also pretty meager, they try really hard to comp with stocks but stocks vest in 4 years.

Employee loyalty is inspired by constant comparison of ""them"" (AMD, Nvidia, ARM, TSMC) vs. ""us"" with little/no accountability on continuous bad decision making. A lot of theatrical performance by leaders and it's surprising how little time is spent on personally getting to know their employees- needs, desires and aspirations. Human resource organization is a joke, they should be called ""resources"" since the ""human"" qualities such as empathy is missing. After hiring, no proactive conversation or coaching for diversity candidates - no wonder they leave in few years. It's alarming the lack of diversity in senior leadership positions. If you are a women and a senior leader, it's highly likely that you'll leave tired of the beauracracy and lack of growth opportunities.It's all about who knows who to get ahead and chances are slim without an executive sponsorship. One free fruit a day (you are only allowed one per the sign next to it), free coffee and soft drinks (caffeine and sugar is good for performance), ""limited choice and average"" food in exchange of full price.

2019-11-06, Technical Program Manager,"Santa Clara, CA","Current Employee, more than 10 years",No Sense of Job Security,"- Decent pay and benefits for region, though not exceptional and less than a number of peer companies.
- Better respect for work-life-balance than many peer companies.
- Many nice, supportive, and helpful co-workers.
- Can be a good company at which to start a career.
- Sabbaticals are a nice benefit.
- Good maternity and bonding leave benefits compared to most U.S. companies.
- Intel has a general expectation that its employees are responsible professionals, so office employees are rarely micro-managed.
","- The accountants are running things (literally). 
- The company is more profitable than it has ever been, yet still finds ways to reduce benefits nearly every year.
- Doing a good job and earning a raise appears to increase an employee's chance of being fired since that raise has now made the employee more expensive than lower-performing peers.
- The company earns billions, yet still manages to structure layoff criteria in ways that ""coincidentally"" disproportionately target older workers.
- Executives seem to see employees as little more than an expense line in a ledger that should be slashed whenever a boost to profit margins is desired, rather than as people who are committed to the success of the company and who have families and lives that may be irreparably harmed.
Advice to Management
Intel regularly stresses internally how much it values its employees, but its layoff practices, years of benefit cuts, and its preference to fire and replace rather than retrain demonstrate something different. If you are not at a director level or higher, your job is always at risk of being eliminated on a whim because someone decides that an internal organization should be 5% smaller based on some random metric. I don't know any employees at Intel that feel they have job security, no matter how much they contribute to the company's success and no matter how profitable they have enabled the company to be.

2019-10-24, Equipment Technician,"Hillsboro, OR","Current Employee, less than 1 year","Great pay and benefits, but too much walking.","Intel offers great pay and great benefits. Most people work a compressed work week which is much better than standard 9 to 5. Lots of room for career growth.
","Too much walking. The Intel RA campus is extremely large and you must walk for 5 to 15 miles each day. Traffic is bad, especially if you live further east from campus.
Advice to Management
Skew hours for different groups to help with car traffic to and from work and it would also help lessen the massive human stampede that occurs when all groups enter the fab all at the same time. Find better means to get around campus to decrease walking distances. Create a better map of the campus specifically for new hires to get around.

","Grinding bureaucracy 
Executives seem more concerned with their advancement than the success of the company 
Telling the truth and and working together for the company's success have become fundamental issues which is surprising if you are a veteran of culture that made this company so successful.
Execution a real issue and in the current culture this leads to finding blame vs. banding together to solve.
Advice to Management
1. The written culture transformation is nice, but senior executives are not role modeling.
2. Need to revamp the vision. Connecting the next billion users to the internet was compelling...today's vision of data centric is rational, but not compelling.
3. Younger leadership is disenfranchised with the actions of leadership and politics. This needs to be addressed or the best talent will leave.

","*Soon to be former employee, here's why!*
If you have a BS in engineering/science, and have loans to pay off then this job is not worth it for you. The job really only requires that you are a person that is willing to learn, other than that it is basically manual labor. Nothing against people in manual labor jobs, and If you spent 4+ years and $100k in college to do manual labor, then this is the job for you. But if you ask me, you can do so much better than this job. But for some reason, upper management in the Portland plants think that you're not good enough to do an engineering job when I know more techs that would be way better at it then most the engineers that I have met. 
There is also no upward mobility. You can possible get the Night shift Engineer position, but pay is the same, and now you are salary and have 10x more work to do. Definitely not worth the headache
Advice to Management
-Use some basic logic for once. 
-Don't encourage engineers to put off problems until they break, if the job was done correctly the first time, there would be less downtime in the long run. 
-Don't be elitist. Pay your workers accordingly. Portland is an expensive place to live, If you convert pay to the cost of living to any small city, I would be making round 36K. That's barley above the average living wage for the US, (meaning my current income is barley above a living wage in Portland). To put it in perspective, I make about $-5/month after loans and rent and a very very very basic food budget. (Oh don't worry, I never wanted to own a house, or have kids anyways and I like being almost homeless every month.) If you want to pay workers accordingly, don't require a bachelors degree for a job that can be done by someone right out of high school, and then pay that person like they are someone right out of high school. Seams.... logical (refer to first point in section).

The great things about Intel GDC:
- Healthcare Benefits
- Paid Vacation time and Medical Leave
- Paid Maternity Leave
- You can change your role or change group or organization within a Year inside Intel
- Lots of free courses about multiple languages and roles
- Human approach
- Free fruit and juice at the cafeteria
- Cafeteria on site
- Free and well equipped Gym on site
- Massage, Dental Care and Nursing on site
- Various activities and after-work groups
- Payslip Bonuses 
- Intel offers Bus Shuttle for most parts of the city
","- Some of the methodologies their are using are very old
- Knowledge sharing within higher grades and lower grades its almost impossible
- The ""No Retaliation"" policy its not always true (depending of the person you had the issue with)
- The pay is not very competitive, its just average or little below the average
- The interview process can last more than a month sometimes
- The Site its very far from many bus routes (but the shuttle its an option)
- They really dont try to retain talent

Lots of chances to prove yourself, lots of smart people to learn from.
I enjoy creating a process and building microprocessors. 
I feel pride in my work
","I believe that having to work 50-70 hours every week is not sustainable. 
There are so many parts of the Sr. Packaging R&D Engineering role it is very difficult to get everything done on time. This title is also called process engineer and Module Engineer.
Have higher ups that like to add stress to the system, verbally put down engineers that are doing the work for them... Seriously, this is a soft skill that goes so far. Just be nice and helpful to the engineers that are actually doing the work that the managers are delegating. don't put us down, especially in meetings in front of our peers and peers in different groups - I don't know why I have to say this...

push LIFE work balance. Life is first. this work is my passion but my passion ends at 5pm. 
Don't put down people that work for you. Help them out with training, connecting to others that help them out/ train them.

2019-09-30, IP Logic Design Engineer/SOC Design Engineer,Bangalore,"Former Employee, less than 1 year",A good place for people with donkey/slave mindset - Worse than a mindless IT job,"you can work from home any day
","I worked in something they call ""RTL design/IP logic Design team"". Within a week I got to know that the designation is fake. Every body in design teams in Intel India is just maintaining the designs made by Israel or American teams. My work only involved removing errors, cleaning and maintaining their flow. The management is trained to manipulate the employees by frequently lying that whatever they are doing is something they have to be proud about. I was lied before I joined to this team that I will be getting the best work in the world!!! 
As soon as I joined I was given a bunch of linting errors. People who worked in Intel for more years lack skills and are incompetent/useless outside India.People who join Intel after college are either stuck in Intel forever or are forced to go for higher studies. US teams consider indians as slaves and expect them to be always available. There are some very senior people in the team who are so insecure that they will try everything they can to make sure that the junior people will not learn anything so that they can remain important. Approaching the management is useless as all they can think about money. You will get reminded of the mind set of indians that led to their enslavement by the europeans in the past.
Advice to Management
I am well aware of the fact that the management is filled with cowards who can never take up intellectual responsibilities. When is the last time you allowed any team to do something from the scratch? You are well aware of the quality of work employees are getting and how much you love boot lickers and you had to be one to get to your position. Best thing to do would be to resign your positions and leave it to bold and smart people.

Lots of goodies
Good work life balance
","If you are looking for a technical software job, this is not the company anymore. You will get service company like jobs like fixing static code analysis issues, legacy bug fixing etc. Typical of an MNC, where US and EU employees get to do the important work whereas India is seen as a maintenance center only.

 Zero onsite opportunities.

Any paper or presentation opportunities are few and far between and mostly gets cancelled by your managers.

Managers have 0 roadmap and you are left in the dark about the future. Have worked in 2 business divisions, one of which thankfully closed and the other called IOTG is worse than a service company. 
Few managers in IOTG even openly discourage you from attending traingings, presenting or publishing papers and patents. 

Come with very very low technical expectations if you are in software.
Advice to Management
Promote technical innovative culture. You are a technology company not a service company! Educate managers about the importance of this culture. A brand name is everything. If you want to brand Intel India as a service company you are on the right track, else act immediately. Else why should we as employees choose you to work for??

Advice to Management
Don't hire PhDs to do 100 hours of grunt work per week. It's expensive for the company and makes us all miserable. Hire twice as many bachelors and a small number of PhDs to do development and you will have a much happier and more productive workforce for the same cost. You also will have a build up of institutional knowledge that is currently impossible with current turnover.

Firing the previous toxic manager of etch was a good start, but the people who came up under that person have the same attitude and resist improvements.

Don't trap people in toxic modules. If no one wants to stay in a module, then try to fix it instead of making it impossible for them to move within the company.

2019-09-04, Soc Design Engineer,"Santa Clara, CA","Former Employee, more than 5 years",Good company. Headwinds ahead..,"Intel is one of the best companies to work in the semiconductor industry. 
Strong brand. Enjoys a very wide competitive moat with its x86 product line. The company is trying hard to transform from a PC-centric business to
data-centric business, but faces significant headwinds and competition in new markets. Few decent acquisitions in the past with good
margins. Payoff on others remain to be seen.
Great people and work-life balance. Strong technical contributors
in some teams. Great resources to learn from if you are motivated and willing
to put in the effort. Great internal recognition tool. Good work is rewarded.
Amazing quarterly and annual bonus plan. Transparent 
profit sharing. Decent ESPP plan.
","If you are an engineer, your mileage will vary depending on the team and the manager. It is easy to get stuck as a cog in a hundred thousand machine.
In some teams few strong technical contributors do all the
heavy-lift, while others easily slack off. Inefficiency is rarely punished.

Slow decision making at the corporate level, which is slowly, but surely making way into newer acquisitions. Hierarchical corp. structure and deep layers
of middle management, some of whom are non-technical. 
Fair amount of internal politics. Hard to get promoted beyond a grade level which leaves no option other than to look for jobs outside. Average
compensation (esp. in the bay area). Low on stock rewards and the stock has barely moved up. Inconsistent hiring standards and nepotism in some teams, which often lead to bad hires who eventually rotate to other teams. Cost-cutting and hiring freeze have become the norm. Some projects are kept floating for the sake of keeping people around.
Advice to Management
Cut down the fat. Improve project focus and execution. Improve
compensation package for great engineers, or they will leave. Layoff poor performers and remove non-technical management. Flatten hierarchies.

","Intel made me an offer at a higher grade and then switched it when I joined. Confronted manager about it and said nothing he could do. Then I switched teams which lead to different title with more pay, a couple of months later HR switches title back to lower pay. My manager only changed title back AFTER focal. The pay in oregon is terrible and there is no career advancement. There is no incentive to take initiative and do more than whats asked. Expect reorgs at least once a year. Intel is slowly cutting benefits: no GPTW, no snacks on fridays, 401k matching isn't what it used to be, change RSU allocation to short change you. Intel can't make any headway into new areas; AI/5G/SSDs are all failures.
