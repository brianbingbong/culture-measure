","Favoritism - There is definitely favoritism, if they like you, you can do whatever you want. Managers - Those that are leads from China, give you no room to grow and everything needs to go through them for approval prior. Takes forever to make a decision. Those managers are often seen as immune from any type of disciplinary issues as often complaints are ""investigated"" but nothing is done to change. They steal all of your work and give no credit to you and either take the credit themselves or give that credit to those that are around them. Company uses a employee rating system, and though it isn't a bad system, the managers will give a bad rating to anyone they don't like, and won't offer an explanation of that bad rating. All in all, I will say, if you want to be nothing, and do nothing, appear to be working and just never shine as a employee, I think its the job for you. You will go through life just collecting a check and whittling away until they get rid of you. But what am I saying, most employees will read this and want to take a chance anyways.

Many perks, free bus, free dinner (if you leave office after 8 P.M., you get a ticket for dinner), and free breakfast now. The canteen is very good with many kinds of food. Great company culture and employee care, let you feel like you are a member of the family. Even after you leave the company, you can still get some care once in a while (I got a red packet last year, and a T-shit this year :)).

","Working in the US office is extremely difficult if you don't speak Mandarin. You may feel socially excluded and depending on your department, you may be cut off from certain kinds of career advancement opportunities Some departments in the US office have, in the past, been grievously misused by management in China. Despite its good investments in videogames and tech, Tencent in general does not have a strong strategy for actually doing business in the west and will often start and stop projects in the US at the drop of the hat. This can be a major career blocker for the western employees assigned to those projects Some of the management in China seems fundamentally unsuited to managing employees in the US. This includes American-born management working in China. Some employees in China tend to ignore work done or recommendations given by employees in the US, particularly if those US employees do not speak Mandarin Once you get off the high of getting a cool trip to a foreign country, you may become exhausted by demands to travel to China over and over again, particularly at times of the year which are sensitive to US employees but not Chinese employees. For example, they may ask you over and over again to spend several weeks in China at the end of December While US HR obeys US labor laws, the departments in China do not seem to have many of the protections we have and you may find yourself in some awkward situations if you go over there and visit. However the biggest harm you are likely to experience is to your sense of self-respect at being associated with a company that does this kind of shit-- in general, I was treated very respectfully Throughout Tencent, disruptive reorganizations are common and it is likely that your job or task will change frequently, often before you are able to make any big successes for yourself. Because this is ubiquitous in the company however it is not exactly a career blocker
