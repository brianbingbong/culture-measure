I work my way up from working in the HP service center, then finance, and later sales. 

The best thing about working here probably because you grew along with the people you work with, you develop friendship over the years. I have seen people come and go. But the actual perks here it's because the office is within a huge mall, right in the center of south jakarta most happening area. The office provide flexibility in working, coming to the office didn't feel like a burden to me. 

The overall situation in the office is very casual plus the multicultural setting create an atmosphere working with people from other countries very much enjoyable and didn't let you stuck working limited only with local people. 

The pay is pretty good depends on your workload and your job level. If your manager is good you will be pampered.
","There is no clear career ladder here. You work your way up on your own. No overtime pay but sometimes you are required to work overtime. The culture here is too regulating somehow even it feels your are being micro manage everytime. And they kicked you out just like that during covid breakdown. But, hey i was just about to leave anyway and it leads me to early retirement package in 2020. So long HPE, it's been a hell of ride.

2021-09-12, Solutions Architect,,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","Terrible Place for Sales Positions, Decent Base Pay & Benefits","Most of the time it is a low stress environment. Base pay is decent for the amount of work required, usually. Benefits are good and generally ethics are considered a priority and most of the people I worked with were great.
","Unbelievable compensation issues for commission and sales incentive work. Account rostering, systems used for crediting sales, etc. are all defunct. More than one occasion had pay RETROACTIVELY taken and awarded to other account teams whose only job is to sit and ""claim"" deals in Salesforce.

The above is exactly the problem; there are too many ""old guard"" leaders and workforce members that have made a career out of doing no work and claiming the work of others. Good leadership from acquisitions and internal growth are alienated and let go, in favor of underqualified legacy HPE managers. 

No one listens to these issues and people use their one counterexample as a way to wave off problems.

Confirmation bias is the thing that kills this place.
Advice to Management
Stop letting good leaders go, stop rewarding useless leaders internally that shouldn't have their current position, let alone promotions.

","Oh so many. Where to start.

Compensation: below market
Stability: minimal, stealth workforce reductions
Politics: backstabbing and undercutting common,
Culture: islands of sanity surrounded by decaying mounds of silos
Company direction: none. This ship is rudderless.
Company growth: via M&A, which they then destroy.
Product offerings: obviated by cloud, not as good as competitors.

Summary: They really don't know what they are. They keep buying companies they don't need, gutting them and losing their value, so it is never accretive. They don't grasp how the market has changed, and believe people will still buy from them, because reasons. The politics and backstabbing drove me out, as it did with many of my colleagues.

","You rarely get a salary raise, even if deserved. Even if company reaches or exceeds target revenue, and your effort was part it, you rarely get to see something else other than your salary. Unfortunately, it seems like upper management constantly gives employees the impression that if they want a salary raise they need to search somewhere else.
Advice to Management
Talk to employees about salary, even if it's stressing and you cannot provide salary raise, it is really important to discuss.

","Politically influenced with emphasis on diversity and inclusion to the extreme. CEO was very quick to assume Asian hate when the spa shooting happened in Georgia without having more facts about the case. Also just announced that all employees will be required to get Covid shot to work in the office regardless of preference or medical condition. This type of decision should be made by individuals and not by the employer.
Advice to Management
Stop being so woke and politically influenced. Treat US employees with more respect despite the political climate. In the US vacation hours top out at 20 years of service. How about giving more vacation hours with each 5 year increments after 20 years. Develop talent internally to reduce reliance on consulting firms as this has been very costly and difficult for HPE employees. Need improvement of internal support to resolve technical issues for employees.

The installations tend to be quite nice. Good input for your CV. Serious company. A bit above average salary. Good flexibility (depending on your manager).
","Managers outside the US are micro managers. If you are not in the USA, there is no growth whatsoever in your career or salary: only lateral movements are possible. The profit sharing is a joke. The salaries, while not bad, are not good either. The company is in a constant state of change with no clear destination. Took pandemic as a pretext to shorten budget at the expense of the employee's tools. There is a clear sensation of subordination if you are not in the USA. When a problem arises, you are completely alone vs the company. The company talks about a magnificent internal culture that is not really applicable in the daily life of the common employee.

There are really good managers who has clear vision and strategy to execute.

Cons

HR function is worse. I witnessed 2 pregnant women being fired. 
Irony is they do offer 6 months maternity leave.

The work life balance was ideal in hewlett packard enterprise. People were also kind and easy to work with. I'd recommend it.
Cons
As of the moment, I can't remember any cons aside from the seeming rule that you cannot be promoted before 2 years has passed. Don't know if that's the case in other teams

","Low pay compared to its competitors, tons of attrition & change, issues with commissions, micromanagement with useless KPI's set by upper management, raises/promotions were based on politics rather than performance, and there was a clear bias for outside (field) sales over inside sales. 

Basically- they hire inside sales reps either with little or no experience so they can underpay them with the hopes of sculping them into exactly what they want. But most reps figure this out within a year or so and go elsewhere for more pay and less bs.
Advice to Management
Fix the painfully obvious issues. Pay reps more, don't change every aspect of their job annually, promote people fairly etc etc. It's not hard to figure this out. Then maybe the avg tenure would be more than 1-2 years.

","There are many cons! The compensation is below market value. HPE pays their employees less than their competitors. The pay structure is set so that middle and upper management get the bulk of the salary increases and bonuses. The culture at HPE is everyone for themselves. It is extremely hard to get promoted and pay raises with the company. The management team consists of re-treads that under performed in other roles that get ""lateral"" opportunities to stay in management roles. So they re-cycle low performing managers to other management positions. This creates a culture of have vs have nots. The company is filled with people that gossip and brown nose to keep their positions. Upper management prefers to have people around them that ""think like them""! There is a lot of political division within the workforce that permeates through clicks and employee silos! People spend a lot of time trying to figure out who the next WFR will be. When people are WFR'd they are usually the last to know. News and rumors travel fast at HPE in Houston. Don't ever get on the bad side of management because they will purposefully make your life miserable! They will lie on you and get the other management contemporaries onboard to craft a negative narrative that will follow you throughout your career. A bunch of ""good old boys and girls"" playing corporate games to keep themselves in power. Please be careful working here! Get in there learn what you can and then take your experience where you will be better compensated and don't have to deal with the far right culture that is overtly prevalent in the workplace at the Houston campus!

Pros
Great Work Culture 
Good Benefits and Perks
Employee Centric when it comes to work culture. You get regular goodies and gifts. 
Good Mediclaim features
Stock options available
Work Pressure is less when we compare Vmware or Dell.
Cons
Not much to learn or explore
Same traditional work 
Legacy technologies are still on
Edge to Cloud is still not heavily used 
GMS cloud is pretty new to establish its roots with the likes of Vmware Vcloud Suite or Oracle cloud. 
No proper hike.
Salary is below industry standard.
Internal Job Posting requires good amount of Skills and experiences and under the table ways to crack in. Later being the most prominent way to get a designation upgrade !!
Advice to Management
Please recognise core talents and hardworks
Managers should be more agile to find out who's doing what. Rather than only recognising them who flatters well. Favouritism should STOP.
Pay hike and Salary should be at par industry standard
More internal movements should be done so that HPE Don't lose out on potential employees to others 

PS.: Managers depends from team to team and so is the work.

Luckily i got a very good manager but not a great team. The kind of work i do is not satisfying.
There's nothing you can learn for sure. Growth is negligible.

Upper management isn’t communicated with properly and very out of touch
Disorganization, on boarding to a new role can take a long time 
Pay could definitely be better
Quotas are too high. No one should be celebrating hitting 75% but unfortunately that’s where we are
Advice to Management
Upper management needs to be more in tune with the every day role of their employees, there is opportunity for greatness here but it’s not being leveraged. Quotas are absolutely unattainable at this point.

2021-06-11, Senior Software Engineer,Bangalore,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Being treated like slaves, lot of politics because of old employees who are incompetent","They show that they have good culture but in actual they are bunch of insecure people who doesn't have good skills and are incompetent to change jobs in the current markt. So they are lying in HPE doing politics, favouritism. Since, they are highly incompetent to get jobs in the current market, they will try to show everyone the same and expect their tem members to work live slaves.
","Manager expects you to work long hours. Lot of people who in HPE for a long time. They feel insecure about their jobs and hence, do a lot of politics, also they will work long long hours and force the other teammates to do the same. 
Almost no hike during appraisal. No internal job change opportunity. Even if it is there, Your current manager will kill it so you remain their slave. 
Negligible hike during appraisal. There is a huge salary between current employee and a new hire for the same job level.
Advice to Management
Why can't you give hike with a promotion. There is a huge gap in salary of current employee and new hire at same job level. Also, clean up your old employee population who are incompetent and do nothing apart from politics or working like slaves.

Does not lay off

Cons
Job becomes monotonous as you are not given chance to learn new
Lot of internal politics
Not a good growth in terms on money as well
Management does not listen 
(all the above only valid for Bangalore customer solution center, rest HPE is retirement company)
Advice to Management
Please stop politics while internal job openings. People who deserve it should get job, rather than giving it to undeserving candidates and that too with no experience. It really pushes us to quit.
Please hire more people as people literally struggle with over work.

Business Outlook
Pros
If you hate your current manager, you'll probably have another one in 3-6 months.
Depending on your management team, you may be able to work remotely for awhile - in my case, about 6+ years but it might also be the reason why they lay 
you off.
You get to put a Fortune 500 company on your resume.
Relatively diverse experience on a lot of different teams / projects.
There used to be amazing and super smart people that worked at HP/HPE, unfortunately, a lot of them probably got laid-off.
Cons
Constant change / instability-Even if you were a consultant and love change, HPE will probably give you PTSD. Org changes were every 3-6 months. 
You will be worked-to-death (nearly) because of the constant layoffs, acquisitions, and spin-offs. There will not be any work-life-balance. 
Difficult to 'officially move-up' even though they may give you a lot of new titles and more responsibilities (excellent ratings/bonuses), you may never officially move past the HR title given to you. 
Pay/salary is lower than their competitors in tech. and you may never get beyond that without leaving/going back.
Neurodiversity Issues - Don't ever tell your manager you're ADHD or that being on ""Skype is distracting"" when you have multiple projects and a gazillion deadlines because HR will want to speak to you (despite being a high performer / HR is clueless about ADHD /autism spectrum/etc) - Say NOTHING. HR is not your friend.
""Transformation"" is a code-word for downsizing / org changes. 
Unique processes that may not translate to other tech companies.
When HPE talks about 'agility' or Lean 6 Sigma, or most other key terms in the industry, their version will, most likely, not be the standard that you are used to. They make it up as they go = agility.
Advice to Management
Learn to 'walk-the-walk' of what you preach to your external customers. Instead of constant change, learn to stabilize, at least until you can figure out if something is or is not working and that isn't 3 months into the process/policy change and then abandon the initiative! You might actually become a better company if you went private again like Dell did...think about it. You were always so beholden to Wall Street that you sacrificed 30,000+ employees that were critical to your operations and customers. Some of the smaller consulting firms that were involved with 'hiring/strategy' were actually abusive to the employees that were farmed out to HPE and I really wondered where the oversight was? I really felt like senior management was out-of-touch with what was going on most of the time. Employee engagement / happiness should be a focus and not an after-thought because the research is out there, your company would probably be performing better if you actually practiced what you preached instead of burning out your best and brightest and then throwing them out like garbage. Honestly, of all the acquisitions you made, Aruba was probably the smartest. You should really take their advice on their innovation / people management / agility instead of going down the same path you have been on since the separation (again, beholden to Wall Street).

Pros
-Well-ventilated workplace. Co-workers are good. 
-Working style is very flexible. Because of COVID-19, all employees can work at home with no application. Even before that, time-flex was established.
-Evaluation is advanced. Not only your result, challenging itself is evaluated.
Cons
You could not feel globalization here. This company corresponds internal customers only. Language is only Japanese.

Trying to compete with amazon is pie in the sky kind of nonsense after you laid off of all the best engineers. While you can try, it is a race between what will tank faster, the server market or HPE's cloud play. Also, the whole diversity/inclusion push is weird; we already are and have been for many years. Trying to drink silicon valley cool-aid and virtue signal is just pathetic. And frankly your hiring guidelines are illegal and you will get sued if they are ever published. Focus on engineering and let your inclusive and diverse workforce do the rest.

There is no way for you to use modern stacks. Everything you propose will be disregarded.

Reported sexual assault which was swept under the carpet

Advice to Management
I don't blame HPE for who they have in charge but the people at a certain level think they are invincible. These people now work for DXC since the merger. If CEO were aware of some of the behaviours I think they would have been disappointed.
When sexual assault is reported rather than giving the guy in question a redundancy package when you say you are investigating do so. The situation was to scary to get the police involved and no investigation was done by HR.
I believe the work ethics of each account and their management are different. There was one account and it was amazing. It had a real expert dynamic, I say this to make sure anyone that does read this I did have some good times.

Some of the finest folks in the industry work or worked for HPE. Co-workers and managers were always ready to help and assist. Truly enjoyed the people there. A few real good product lines, like Aruba, as well. Also the CEO articulates sound strategies, but execution fails.
","Inability to execute. Legacy business models and offerings have forced the company to be a commodity provider relying on selling solid, but me-to products. This is a space much better suited for nimbler entities. Especially for a company that tries to reinvent itself annually. HPE has bewildering back office procedures, which cripple its ability to bring differentiated products and services to market in a timely or cost effective manner. Like many old behemoths the right hand simply doesn't know what the left hand is doing.
Advice to Management
Streamline business processes. I would completely eliminate all back-office functions and start from scratch! Yes, they are completely broken. Just ask any front line sales about specialised pricing or procurement, ask your customers about accessing appropriate Support resources. It's broken, dont fix it, replace it.

CEO Approval
Business Outlook
Pros
Very relaxed environment
Great people to be around and work with
Decent projects
Very flexible working schedule
Learning benefits
Very limited travel for client work (even pre covid)

It doesn't come with the office politics, the people that are willing to step over dead bodies to go up the ladder and the amount of red tape other big consultancies are notorious for, which makes it a much friendlier place to be in and much easier to aclimitise when you first join. Projects can also be very interesting and you can gain a lot of knowledge, as long as you end up in one of the interesting ones.
Cons
Lacks the skillset that other companies have in certain IT areas
Projects can be uninteresting at times
Rotation between projects can be difficult
No structured way of sharing knowledge
Recognition is there, but promos can be a bit slow
Not a very clear path of where one can go after the ""manager"" level
Advice to Management
Offer more structured ways of sharing the knowledge. Attempts have been made in the past but they're always going stale after a while and people just stop caring about this part of their job. Siloed knowledge and skillset end up creating cult groups.

Offer more responsibility to people who are ready to take it.

","The company as a whole is abandoning the strengths that have gotten them the success they have so far, to ""pivot"" to the ""as a service"" model and deemphasizing the servers and direct install software lines. In my opinion, that will be the beginning of the end for the company as a whole and it will spiral downward over the next several years.

Working as a Contractor will be hard as you will be working on par with your colleagues if not better than them at few instances but, when the day comes you will be paid much lesser than an onrole person. Plus there are no yearly performance reviews, No yearly hikes

2021-03-19, Senior Marketing Manager,,Current Employee,"HPE is a ""fine"" company - not horrible, not great","Able to work autonomously which is nice. All depends on your manager
","Lots of disarray in my group. No tools, need sales teams to follow up. Vacation time is not up to par. You get 3 weeks, but HPE makes you take 1 week at Christmas. So essentially you have 2 weeks of vacation that you can use when ""YOU"" want to take vacation.
Advice to Management
Fix vacation time off. It's far below industry standard. Most companies do shut down between Xmas and New Years, but don't make people take PTO.

2. Ok benefits
3.good focus but too slow to evolve
","Lala favouritism culture in India from HR teams to leaders assistants to Sales teams highly encouraged from top to bottom in structure .

1. Too many 40-60 yr olds associated with this company for over 20 years hence the problem is political powerhouses created with no space for MNC culture and I am the boss do as i say attitude with less risk takers , or enthusiasm to contribute .Tech teams lack knowledge and the managers are more than required in number and also highly insecure than in any other MNC hence focussed on themselves completely and busy appreciating themselves in each recognition platform showcasing their own good work and lack leadership broader vision , team spirit and good team practises 

2. HR culture only on paper , HR teams are the ones growing by being inline to top managers say 100%

3. Diversity on paper , good for entry of women n girls from colleges with whom they have tieups or yes 15 yr old in company or some current employees relative 

4.People are insecure to share knowledge , work together and take risks .. too many old timer managers afraid of change or something new or acknowledging others work .. its like a PSU sir culture totally 

5. Only managers no leaders here hence do not expect anything work for money no growth And leave on finding something better ...
Advice to Management
Please broaden the mindset especially develop leadership as manager culture is much like a PSU. People work and leave but in any PSU managers keep sitting in organization and growing for decades at a place eroding the very basic concept of let others also grow and progress . I am the boss so I cannot help , 2.he is my favourite so he does not need to work , 3.the other is someone elses relative hence do not expect from him , 4. the 5th is 15 yr old here with deep knowledge hence take guidance do not expdct contribution ... out of 6-7 in a team hardly 1-2 working and making others grow for obvious reasons .

This culture wont take any organization farther and is dated impractical and less productive and demotivating for obvious reasons

Stop laying the people doing the work off. Company is run top down and the people at the top have a disconnect with the ones at the bottom. Decisions from the top don't make sense and the people at the bottom suffer. Most of the work is being outsourced to Taiwan currently. So much for this being an American Company. They really shouldn't have the name Hewlett Packard any more when most of the work is done in Taiwan. Just change it to a Taiwanese name.

Advice to Management
While the CEO drives the vision, it needs to trickle down to the people who drive change.

 It is essential to ensure that people driving change are recognized for how difficult that is in the current company culture Vs being dinged on growth opportunities due to internal people centricity metrics as they focused on larger org priorities - otherwise you will have people fearful of making Bold moves.

2021-01-31, Strategic Procurement Manager,"Santa Clara, CA","Former Employee, more than 10 years",HPE does not value the HP Way,"Some great individual contributors, who only want the best for the company and fellow employees. Many seasoned people are great in sharing their knowledge, while a lot of early career hires are eager to learn and make a difference. Executives have worked hard to align the company values with the old ""HP Way"" which Bill & Dave, (Hewlett & Packard), began the company with, being the employees are the most valuable asset.
","Middle Management and former Compaq values have destroyed the company. After the HP/Compaq merger, much of the Compaq management were put in charge of manufacturing & supply-chain decisions which put HP back 20 years in the streamlined processes, and ethical dealing, (i.e. supply-chain management accepted items which could be construed as 'gifts' which influenced decisions). When HP employees expressed better ways of doing things, they were threated with the jobs and told by the Compaq management, ""We've Always Done Things, This Way"". HP's open door policy was pushed aside, as the Compaq management talked out of both side of their mouths, saying they want to hear new ideas, and got angry when people did not follow, ""The Chain of Command"". Managers, not individual contributors, are rewarded significantly with bonuses when meeting 'metrics' that are mostly made up numbers, while individual contributors are told they must make those metrics or fear loosing their jobs. Little to no opportunity for advancement, as recruiters are compensated for hiring from outside the company, or if an employee does everything, (ethical or not), to make their management look good to get bonuses.
Advice to Management
Not sure if there is a chance to turn things around, even though a lot of middle management has been removed, but think it is a mistake moving the headquarters to Houston, where the values are not the same as Palo Alto had. Take away the bonus structure for management, and bring back the profit sharing program for all employees that is not tied to each business unit.

","Volatile, stagnant, and unbalanced. Organizational structure gets shuffled far too often, with layers upon layers of ineffectual middle management. Location dictates promotion chances. Performance rating, which affects your yearly bonus and promotion opportunities, is relative to the rest of your team members, which makes performance ratings something of a strategic decision.

Invest more in Data Analytics. We can do so much more, but it needs better funding. I've been with HPE for 19 years (9 yrs as contractor and 10 yrs as employee) and was recently WFR'd due to cost. I created, from the ground up, a complete data analytics ecosystem (EPRID: 209789) for the North AMS SS&P group. I have much more to contribute to the company and I'm sad that my organization looked at current cost as a decision point over a mid-to-long term investment.

I created, from the ground up, a complete data analytics ecosystem (EPRID: 209789) for the North AMS SS&P group. I have much more to contribute to the company and I'm sad that my organization looked at current cost as a decision point over a mid-to-long term investment.

Advice to Management
quit laying off the long term employees that know how things work. This creates a knowledge vacuum that can not be replaced. also, decide what you want to be and stick with it. quit changing directions every 2-3 years. all the top talent has left or is leaving or being ran out of the company. I enjoyed my time at HPE, over 10 years but the political games, constant change and low pay definitely wear you out. Its a great place to start your career but don't think they will let you retire there. get your experience and move on to your next job where you can make a career. What's left of Senior Mgmt needs to gracefully move on and let others lead this once great company.

","Antonio has professed the same strategy for years, but seems to have a new re-org every 2 or 3 months so the strategy doesn't get any traction.

Stock price shows no signs of improving.

Salary reduction and ending 401k matching during pandemic was poorly implemented. Not all employees were affected.

More energy is dedicated towards finding out who the new players are from the latest reorg than is spent actually executing on strategy.

Much more money to be made elsewhere.

2021-01-16, Graphic Designer,Bucharest,Current Employee,Jack of ALL TRADES Master of all,"-Relatively decent salary at the start, considering the average salaries in Romania.
-Was lucky and came in a team where the colleagues are really nice people and I love them
-Opportunity to learn new things and further develop your career at least for me
","-Manager is not aware of how many biases they have, but keeps talking about them like they're the perfect human being.
-Favoritism and nepotism are in season here, outweighing actual skill, knowledge, ability to comprehend, communication skills and so on. The bigger the lamb you are the more your favored for positions like TL/project lead/manager.
-Salary increase non existent, if you ask ""there are no funds"". Yearly increase debatable, 3% to max 2 people in the team IF they ""exceed expectations"". I exceeded all expectations in my yearly review and got 3%.
-You're promoted, but you don't get a salary increase. unless it's TL or Manager promotion. Being promoted to a new and completely different role, does not mean you discard your previous roles. So Outlook signatures look like lists of employees in a team, even though they're all roles for 1 single person.
-Job Description for which you are hired is tripled after the first month and not even on paper. They just keep giving you tasks until you reach a point where you work 15hrs a day and start getting heart spikes and fatigue. They pretend to care, but then they ask about deadlines and tasks pending :)) so hypocrisy at it's best.

Who here LOVES this sentence ""HAPPY MONDAY EVERYONE"" :))) followed by a trillion tasks you need to do ""yesterday"".

-HORRIBLE WORK STATIONS, like let's be frank, a decade old G3 HP laptop(which is definitely NOT a workstation), in a job position where you work with PHOTOSHOP and ADOBE SUITE in general, with CODE, with HUGE Excel files of tens of thousands of rows filled with data (try performing VLOOKUP's or pivot tables on that, good luck), which was handed to you day 1 with a burned out battery, which reboots randomly when you're in the middle of important past deadline work, which apparently goes into sleep mode or lock screen whenever it feels tired, which besides being a 14"" screen, doesn't even have a functioning HDMI slot, come to think of it IT DOESN'T HAVE ONE AT ALL, it only has VGA which is broken. You got to admit, HP laptops have a mind and personality of their own!
-Last millennia's tools, outdated programs which barely function and make your work even harder. (combined with the very performing G3, woo you got the perfect combo right there).
-With the covid situation, we were told that we can request extra screens and desk chairs to have a more comfortable WFH experience. I put in my request 3 months ago. Guess what, still using MY OWN. Manager did not care until I asked and when I asked they blamed me for not putting in the request, when THEY were supposed to put them in, let us know when they get approved and THEN we would log in a ticket to either go pick them up, or to pay 100 lei to have them delivered directly to our house. 

There's a lot more to say, but I guess this is enough to get the gist of what HPE really means.

2021-01-14, Sales,,Former Employee,Improving culture but still Lots of other areas to work on.,"Culture is improving significantly with a strong focus on employee welfare. 

CEO leadership is strong and developing, with strong experience and roots across the company.

Benefits (not salary) are on par with peer organisations.

A fair degree of autonomy is afforded (with most managers) and trust can be earned quickly.
","Some leaders are stuck in formulaic approach with little innovative thinking.

Salary increments are very low compared to the industry (despite what HR say).

Cliques and favorites are prevalent with managers, leading to a lot of hiring in their own image, limiting diverse thinking.

Global functions have often been ineffective with respect to the country-level organisations. This leads to Global functions perceiving themselves to be above country orgs in the hierarchy, acting with a bias to transmit versus discuss, and a lack of accountability to the front line staff.

","Very unpleasant leadership. It is a terrible organisation with constant turnmoil and WFRs. People are scared to speak up because of retaliation from leaders. Very low employee engagement scores in my organisation. No career development opportunities. No learning and development. Only poor quality online training.
Advice to Management
Get rid of all senior HR execs. Start with Chief Talent Officer. She is the worst HR person I have ever seen in my career. People are the greatest asset of an organisation but not according to HPE's Chief talent officer. I have never heard a senior HR leader to speak so disrespectfully of employees. She sees people as 'cost', as a 'burden' that we need to get rid of rather than an 'asset'. She fired the best leaders in the organisation, so she doesn't look so incompetent. It is such a shame! This is a classic example of a poor leader who destroys an organisation. Leadership matters more than anything else.

2020-12-04, Custom Project/Program Manager,,"Former Employee, more than 5 years",Exactly what you would expect in the current economy,"The benefits offered are good. These include life insurance, group legal, and discount programs. They offer excellent starting PTO (15 days plus a bunch of holidays). They recently deployed a terrific parental leave program that affords new parents (mothers and fathers) 6 months of paid leave. Prior to the suspension of the 401k, the match was decent. They are a mature organization when it comes to operating in a remote work setting.
","Tools/programs for completing work are half-baked and frequently run out of funding. Constant name changes for different business units based on the director of the week. WFR culture is the modus operandi. Good luck getting promoted or raises. Salary for individual contributors is well below market rate.
Advice to Management
Stop failing your workforce. There are way too many bumps on the log that have no real skills outside of HPE, so they panic when they hear WFR. Stop making decisions based solely on employee costs. Instead, consider how you can retool the current workforce. The 10-15% pay reduction turned out to be completely unnecessary given the massive WFR in November and December. Stop partaking in political movements that are garbage and subjecting employees to ""sensitivity training"".

","No consistency in corporate vision or culture. Things that should be fundamental and immutable parts of our core were thrown out and replaced with shocking regularity. No one bothered trying to remember the ""core values"" because they kept changing so often. 
The quality of the people in senior leadership positions varied greatly. Some of the VPs were excellent, inspirational leaders but they were the exception rather than the rule. For some reason, the culture at HPE tends to put clueless, empire building ass-kissers into key senior leadership positions. Failures of leadership are clearly to blame for most of HP's big problems over the years. 
I despised the system of forced ratings distributions for performance evaluations. No more than 10% of the people in a team can receive the top rating and at least 7% MUST get the worst rating, regardless of the circumstances, no exceptions. As a manager, this gave me an incentive to tolerate, even encourage, poor performance in some people just so I could have justification for giving the poor performance ratings at the end of the year. Its a stupid, counter-productive and demoralizing policy.

In the past, I found this leading me to triple-check every item on a spreadsheet, closely proofread emails to ensure I’d communicated what I was trying to get across in a clear, concise way, or fiddle with the layout of a presentation to ensure that it was perfect. I’ve since learned to successfully budget my time and gauge which tasks require and actually benefit from this level of precision.

Pros
I didn't find any pros or perks worth mentioning in my limited time there.
Cons
- I worked at a client location and left within few months due to the toxic work environment.
- There was no WFH despite the whole Corona situation in Delhi.
- We were forced to work on weekends, till late nights and on holidays.
- Some of the management people treated employees like slaves and there behaviour was really unprofessional and questionable.
- People were not allowed leaves even if they were sick.
- Even after few employees tested Covid positive, rest were called to office and made to sit 9 hours daily.
- Customer was treated as God and employees as slaves.

This may not the be the situation of whole company but my project experience was really disappointing.

2020-11-20, Cyber Security Analyst,Galway,"Former Employee, less than 1 year","Leave your brain at the door, toxicity abounds in the CDC.","Decent pay and subsidized food in the restaurant.
","A self proclaimed ""world class"" cyber defence center. You know they're not world class when they have to actually say that and when they're the only one's saying it. A group made up of people from penneys, bars, hotels, IT repair shops etc. A lot of which have no prior experience and trained by people from similar backgrounds with almost none of the staff having experience beyond a few years in the job.
Hardly what anyone else would qualify as world class security professionals.

In the job bullying is encouraged from the leads, by lower management and expected to be accepted. Expressing a dissenting opinion or even disagreeing with an opinion of someone more senior is the quickest way to be ostracized in a clique based environment where compliance is mandatory. Complaining is also a sure way to know that you won't be kept on beyond the 11 months contracts as noted with other interns who are gone now. The illusory job at the end seems to be something lower management wants to dangle over your head so they can have you do all kinds random other things beyond your working hours or duties. Insincerity is rife, with a number of fake brown nosers about and ultimately the status quo of toxicity has to be maintained at all costs, so yeah don't complain, you're privileged to be here in this hellhole.

Leave your brain at the door as you won't be able to do the slightest and most rudimentary tasks without getting permission each and every time regardless of how basic it is and how repetitive some of the alerts are. Your opinion does not count. In any way. Only those with marginally greater experience does, or a lead. Follow what they say no matter what, EVEN, if they contradict each other. Only what the lead on shift says is valid.

You may have been great in other jobs and valued a lot. In here, comply always and forever in everything, don't think. The most controlling place i've worked in despite some aspects of the work being incredibly basic.

You hire people to become analysts and then train them become monkeys and forgo their own thinking. I shudder to think what might happen when a crisis hits and these people who have been trained to just obey have to use their independent thought. Sounds like a crisis waiting to happen.
Advice to Management
If you do manage to hire smart people, help them to develop as analysts including their own autonomy, and thinking, instead of killing their drive with the above mentioned. Show trust to them over time and stop stifling them by not even letting them do menial repetitive tasks or some of the basic alerts that a 12 year old could do without permission. You're stifling their autonomy, enjoyment of the work, development as security analysts and feeling of actual ownership for what they're working on.

Stop allowing leads and maybe even lower management to treat the interns like they are nothing and remove some of the cut throat leads who do this. There are leads at HPE that can teach and can be really good at that and can develop the people in there. Encourage that kind of behaviour and start treating people with respect. You will lose more people to this, especially if they have experience in better environments or value being treated any way decent.

Working for HPE in the CDC ain't as marvellous as you guys want to have the interns believe. The only reason you're getting away with it is because the interns don't know any better. For most of them this is the only corporate job they've had and that's abused to the max here.

Advice to Management
Management tends to speak in ""corporate speak"" and it is not authentic. In every employee meeting, every Executive talks about how they are ""so excited"" about whatever they are announcing, even if it bombs later. Antonio Neri is outstanding but the next levels on down are weak. They are currently restructuring, and employees have waited months to find out their new role. They use a Voice of the Workforce survey, then do nothing to address the gaps and concerns. They talk about being the kind of company that everyone wants to work for, but do nothing to invest in systems and processes to minimize the administrative burden on employees. I bet it gets better as the market demands efficiency and effectiveness.

Please overhaul and create a commissions portal so sales employees can track the funds that they earn. Good salespeople leave your company every year because the company has difficulty paying them properly. Create an employee portal where all groups can search, connect, and communicate with each other in a fast organized manor. Provide easy to locate organization charts and a chain of command.

","Poor benefits. -- expensive and high out-of-pocket expenses.
Really horrible at acquisition integration.
Very communicative about irrelevant successfulness of ""the business"".
For years they told us how valuable our division was until it was suddenly shut down. Basically, our product was commoditized. Would you like SimpliVity fries with that enterprise order?
Had many touchy feely meetings at the beginning of the COVID-10 crisis telling us how important family was and that we were part of the ""HPE family. Right up until they laid off well over 100 employees right in the middle of the pandemic. The layoff was not pandemic related. The reason was purely pure greed. I am sure executives made great bonuses for the quarter. HPE announced a new acquisition the very same day the SimpliVity division was closed.
Advice to Management
Enough of the disingenuous rhetoric. You could have been truthful and given your ""HPE family"" members time to look for a job while they still able to provide for their real families during the pandemic. You know, like our spouses and children who need food, shelter and, yes, medical coverage during the pandemic.

Recommend
CEO Approval
Business Outlook
Pros
- You can join on a decent package
- They try to ensure Sales & PreSales earn close to OTE with SPIF's on occasion
- Largely left to get on with things how you see fit in the field
- Some decent Managers
Cons
- No annual Salary or package increases, not even cost of living / RPI related, so your income effectively erodes over time
- Increasingly plaguing PreSales with SFDC related admin that's unnecessary - activity time logging and suchlike
- Process & red tape to do simple things like get competitive pricing out to customers is plain silly
- Layoffs are a frighteningly regular occurence with 'Workforce Reduction' type initiatives every year I've been here with a large scale WFR programme underway currently leaving it hard to feel any sense of job security
- Removed car allowance from many staff out of the blue saying that they hadn't done enough mileage to qualify when up until then everyone that had it included when they joined thought it would alway be guaranteed income like their basic. Those staff effectively lost thousands from their annual packages
Advice to Management
Stop with the frequent layoffs and don't nickle & dime employees with things like the car allowance removal and not even inflationary salary increases to cover cost of living increases. Remove the unnecessary admin & process burden from your field sellers to give them more time to spend on revenue generating activities.

2020 has clearly been a difficult year but navigating onwards needs a steady hand and nerve, NOT knee-jerk reaction in terms of WFR. A move to increasingly early career Inside Sales people largely lacking in experience is not the way to beat the seasoned competition. Working with the channel is very necessary but channel resellers increasingly rely on us to do the heavy lifting for them - getting rid of that in-house skills and experience will not bode well and those same channel partners will look elsewhere to Vendors that can do the heavy lifting and pay them decent margin.

","Benefits could be improved. Pay was below market value. After going through a couple splits with the company, employees were not treated well and it was a pretty demoralizing place to work. No perks, benefits were cut, budgets were so tight. The kitchen didn't have any utensils or plates... something as basic as that shows how company focuses on squeezing pennies at the expense of employees' well being to meet the bottom-line. Great people ended up leaving the company one by one. The work was pretty dry with no real innovation. Very bureaucratic. I didn't get to exercise my creative thinking and take lead on my work, so when I left the company to join a place where that was encouraged, it was a culture shock to me.

Stop allowing managers to bring in talent and promote based on relationships and not skills. Be true to the inside workforce and diversify, train and promote workers.

","HP- HPE has been on a transformation journey for decades, and with that thousands of layoffs have been the constant. During almost 11 years I never felt any type of job security. I absorbed at one point 3 people’s jobs as they let them go and I started because I was ridiculously underpaid. 
There is no control over the amount of work or effort that it takes to do a certain role, so some people might be doing nothing while others are being overworked.

There’s no real career path, although they sell you that the sky is the limit, I was never longer than 2-3 years on a role before a new reorganization or transformation would hit and another arbitrary role would be assigned. 
Applying for jobs to try to move or escalate internally is all a lie. 
Roles are pretty much given by who you know, you will get interviews, because obviously there’s an HR process to follow, but they will ask you whatever just to make the “quota” and tell you that they selected someone else, and that you lacked skills that they did not even bother to ask if you had.
They keep bringing people from Dell, Cisco and other competitors hoping that they will provide competitive insight, and these people will start laying off people to bring in their new buddies and cycle starts.
Being a USA employee is really hard, as their location strategy is to send all to low cost countries. So most jobs in US tend to be moved to Mexico, India or Low Cost countries in Europe.
They also love to let go people with long careers in the Company, I am taking with about 20+ years, by forcing them on early retirement, regardless if they are ready or not. I know a bunch of people that went through it and are now trying to look for a job in their late 50’s early 60’s. A pretty bad way to thank loyal employees who invested their whole lives in the Company. 
They did change their benefits being really altruistic by offering 26 weeks of parental leave. All of this happened while I was already pregnant, so I was pretty exited about that! 
I came from maternity just to realize they had hired a replacement in a low cost country , and they laid me off a month an a half after returning from maternity leave.
I would not recommend this company to work for if you value yourself, and or if you are looking for career growth and stability.
Advice to Management
Value the employees that are about to retire instead of getting rid of them.
Workforce reductions will help you with your balance sheet but is it a sustainable strategy? You have let go so many talent that is being taken by the competition and then wonder why you keep struggling to meet you goals.

The reporting structure was effective, too, making it easy to escalate issues if needed.
","As with other long-lived companies I've worked for, there's a fair number of employees that seem to be ""phoning it in"" during their last few years before retirement. The management have made a strong push toward modern process and provided a bit of a ""shake up"" to those who aren't fully engaged, but you'll still find pockets of co-workers who seem to only respond to critical issues and otherwise coast along.

Neri (CEO) repeatedly invokes the long rich history of HP and it's founders Hewlett and Packard. He should stop doing this. His way has nothing to do with the HP Way or respect for the individual. He should embrace his way as the WFR (work force reduction) way. Maybe change the name of the company from HPE to WFR.

2020-08-24,Anonymous,,Former Employee,Behind the times and struggling to cope,"Very nice pleasant people. Seriously everyone works and acts with kindness. 
Great work life balance and accommodating personal needs.
","Monumentally behind the times and totally in capable of acting efficiently. 
Nothing gets done without an 8-12 month road map and months of documentation. This could in theory be great and lead to better organization but in reality it means there's constant delays and a lack of competition with more modern nimble competitors. 
There's also an enormous and costly reliance on DXC for any technical task and an extreme lack of even slightly technical people outside of IT/engineering. 
The work life balance is nice in some ways but there are very many employees working at half capacity because they can or because no one is encouraged to automate or be productive. Lots of very manual work done very slowly. 
Data is a complete disaster despite using best of breed solutions and reps struggle to find info as basic as order data or even install base. 
Adding to all this management made it a month into the pandemic before cutting pay across the board and laying off many employees. All the while making more large acquisitions of barely competitive companies. If it took weeks to lead to a covid melt down at an enterprise company where everyone worked remote anyway it can't bode well for the future.
Advice to Management
Build internal talent and cut DXC loose. 
Remove unproductive employees and foster an environment of productivity vs manual work arounds.
Develop more nimble processes.

2020-08-11,Anonymous,,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Good work life balance, constant reorgs","Work life balance is great. The company is slower paced which can be good and bad, depending on your preferences. Easy job as long as you do as your told. Good benefits, flexible WFH options
","Constant threat of layoffs due to reorgs. Management finds it convenient to cut labor expense than own up to strategy failures in other ways. Organization is very hierarchical with some micromanaging at each level. Age discrimination can be a thing depending where you are.
Advice to Management
Instead of improving bottom line by cutting jobs, have more accountability at the top so major strategic decisions don't just affect ICs. Enable more autonomy amongst the employees - it will driver more accountability and better results.

I think management is on a good path to make sure HPE is around for a long time. Continue to focus on the customer and the employees. I would definitely work for HPE again if the opportunity exist.

- Good work life balance
- Good collaboration across different teams
","- Very poor at compensation. Have not been paying good bonuses for last 8-10 years. Stock component is nothing. Base salary increments are very small and are not given every year.
- Focuses only on giving more vacations but that does not help.
- There is no plan for retening talent.
- ESPP (or SPP) sucks big time. They should consider giving 15% discount on the closing price of first or last day of the 6 months period whichever is smaller.
- Medical premiums are high.
Advice to Management
Start improving people's compensation. Don't ignore that compensation is very crucial part in keeping people happy. Talk to the employees no that front and understand their concerns. 
Adopt to the latest and greatest tools and technologies at work place.

Pros
Overall pretty good pay and benefits. Upper Management do try to promote a positive culture but it can get a little cheesy at times.
Cons
Mostly have to self-train, and some PDFs/videos are not enough for technically complex products. Getting approval to cross-train to improve skills is very difficult. I was not officially trained on most of the products I was expected to support at a 3rd level. 
They have an historical pattern of outsourcing/laying off, losing clients/contracts because of poor service, then hiring again, outsource, lay off. Rinse, repeat.
Advice to Management
REAL training, like classes/labs, not just CBTs. Stop outsourcing. It never ends well.

","The onboarding process is a bit disjointed at times. Training materials are lacking for some essential aspects of the job and you're expected to just know who's who in a large worldwide organization that has tens of thousands of employees scattered across a myriad of departments in hundreds of locations worldwide.

","There feels like little room for growth even though it is talked about often. In 5+ years of being with the company I have only truly been permitted to grow vertically once and it took a significant amount of effort to force upper managements hand.

2020-04-22, Systems/Software Engineer V,"Seattle, WA","Current Employee, less than 1 year","Decent W/L Balance, cheap on benefits","It's a big company with resources if you need it. My part of the company was purchased recently (former HPC company), and that group has been exceptional to work with.
","It's a big company with a massive emphasis on only one thing: shareholder value. This is good from an investors point of view, but bad when it comes to investing in anything that will add true value down the road. 

Every chance they get, they attempt to decrease costs in a way the is not transparent. Health benefits seemed acceptable, until I started using them. The (high) deductible is split into 4 groups, in-network/out of network and medical vs pharmacy, and all that costs me (for myself and my husband) around $500/mo. All other benefits tanked after the acquisition as well, and my old company wasn't a big, they just treated people right. 

Work/life balance is reasonable, but most people that have been there long enough seem to just be getting through it. Not much excitement for innovating or doing anything new. It seems like a great place to be a salesman, not a great place to be an engineer, as all the innovation they make is purchased from other companies. 

There's also a massive hierarchy and tons of red tape for almost everything. My manager has been great at keeping it from being my issue, but I can see the toll it's taken on him and others in management.
Advice to Management
Be more transparent with people and invest in new technologies. Try to break down the silos between different groups that de-incentivizes collaboration. There's a chance for this company to do great things, but massive changes are needed from the top level down.

","Lack of innovation. Lack of capable leaders. Management don't really care about innovation, only about making a sale. Will sell anything if it brings in money. Does not really care about customers, or employees for that matter. Management lacks the EQ to motivate employees, at least in my department. Pep talk does more harm than good.

Just recently implemented one work from home day a week (must be in office every Monday and Friday). 
Wellness Friday - able to leave at 2pm every second Friday of the month. 
Point system to acknowledge good work allowing for online store purchases.
","There is a colossal issue with compensation - the team complains time and time again about inconsistencies with little to no resolution. 
There is no explanation on how you are compensated on each deal. 
There is not a lot of career advancement opportunities for HPE Canada. 
The office culture is very archaic and you need to be in a cubicle 4 days a week from ~9-5. 
You spend one fiscal year in a territory building relationships with customers and then are moved to another the following year to start over. 
There is no formal onboarding training for HPE Canada - you must ask busy coworkers how to do each task every day until you are savvy. 
There are weekly pressures to forecast deals in which you have little control with closing. 
This is not really a sales job - more so administrative.

Supports working from home but depends on manager
","I would not recommend this company because the pay and benefits are lower than average and definitely not competitive, the company does not invest in tools for their engineering groups and the type of work you mostly end up doing is cleaning up other people's messes.

* Company is behind on the technology curve with their products, trying to catch up with distributed system design with microservices
* The recent company change laid off almost all their senior engineers and increased the amount of lower paid, less experienced, offshore engineers from 30% to 60%. Now this new group is expected to transform their monolith products to a microservice architecture???
* Engineering groups are asked to develop leading products with poor tools and limited budgets. This is a company that supports business people, not engineers.
* Engineers spend most of their time fixing someone else's defects and rarely get to work on something new.
* Below average pay for what you are asked to do. Benefits (especially insurance) are more expensive and not competitive.
* The company makes it difficult to move positions within the company for career growth.
Advice to Management
* Invest in good tools for your engineers or what you get is ""garbage in, garbage out"".
* Offer competitive pay and benefits are truly reflective of the market versus lowest common denominator 
* Build a culture of software quality (more CI/CD) so engineers are not frustrated with cleaning up other people's messy code with lots of defects.

2. Salary can be a little better as its less when compared to the rivals.
3. Contract employees conversion depends on the manager's liking of him/her.

Please stop hiring stupid folks from college and waste time, money and trainings when you know most of them leave in a year to go for further studies or get their fantasy job in some other company. 
Infact give chance to the contract employees who work for less, already know the process and technology and are reliable to stay for a long time in the company. Plus these guys know the value of the job. 
Can hire from college also but gaze them properly and make sure if they are in they atleast stay for ample amount of time and are really wanna part of HPE. Dont be a doormat for them.

Canteen was low quality prison food. 
NO respect from the managers. 
This felt like being a slave back in 1700s USA or a modern ""boiler room"" in Philipines or India.
The moral was rock bottom across all our teams, mainly because of managers and an completely unreasonable workload. 
I genuinely hated every hour I spent in the office. 
Once I found something elsewhere I walked out with a smile on my face... whilst feeling a great sadness for everyone who was left behind. 
NOBODY wanted to work there, it was purely a means to pay our rent and food whilst desperately trying to find another job on the market.
I have NEVER had such a bad work experience ever in my entire life, in ANY country or ANY work environment... ever... EVER!!

My advice to the managers is obvious, you whold have left your job or changed your attitude. 
If you were fit for your roles you would be able to dicern that you literally killed the teams that you were there to build up. 
I was amazed that you did not analyzed yourself as we walked out one after one fuming with anger.
This inability/unwillingness to change yourself was also a case of utmost hypocrisy since you at the same time DEMANDED a positive change from the people working under you.

2020-02-29, Senior Software Engineer,,"Former Employee, more than 10 years",It's not HP anymore,"In its heyday, up until around 2006, HP was THE place to work. ""The HP Way"" was that management's job was to tell their people what the objective was, then ""let them loose"" to accomplish it. And it worked, exceedingly well. Management was there to provide support and enable their people. ""Micro-management"" didn't exist at HP. People felt proud to contribute, to ""break rules"" if needed, and innovation was a ""given."" Bill & Dave treated everyone as a friend or family. This type of managment was unheard of back when HP was just beginning, and at the time other CEOs literally laughed at their business model. They stopped laughing very quickly, but found it difficult to become ""Another HP;"" It takes very unique skills that the founders were blessed with.
","However, eventually Bill & Dave passed on and we brought in a CEO who outright disliked everything HP was. (One example: HP had ""profit sharing"" and we had a good year and the rewards were quite good. The new CEO was angry at ""having"" to spend those monies on people and rushed to make profit sharing a thing of the past.) And we purchased, in an attempt to ""be bigger"" a company that also didn't fit the HP Way model. From there, the company changed almost overnight. And the change took away what was truly a unique company and replaced it with becoming just another cold, even heartless one. I left HP as a result, as did most of my coworkers. The HP I left had promised me my job back, and I followed up only to find they had a ""policy change,"" and once you left you were not welcomed back. Instead they hired new people, people who know nothing about the old HP, and assumed all companies were the same, job security was always a concern, rewards are rare, and you felt ""disposable."" My heart breaks to see such a miracle disappear.

And my title here, ""It's not HP anymore"" was something a friend who stayed. When she heard I was thinking of coming back she said I shouldn't, and she too wished she had left but was getting closer to retiring. But like most of us ""Old timers,"" seeing what happened to HP is, in a word, painful.
Advice to Management
Watch (At least) one documentary, I suggest ""HP Origins."" It does a very good job about how HP started, about Bill & Dave, and primarily, what ""The HP Way"" truly is. It's well-worth the 1/2 hour. Good luck to all.

2020-02-26, Operations,"Bloomington, MN","Former Employee, less than 1 year",Only there 2 mths and not impressed.,"Good pay. OK benefits (minus health because of the surcharge fee they have for adding dependants) Wellness Fridays seemed cool and good idea.
","Our small but mighty tech company was recently acquired by HPe. My position was eliminated in the process. My end date rolled into the first months of them acquiring us, which was odd and didn't seem necessary. We had to enroll in benefits, payroll, IT systems, only to lose them a month later when we ended. Although they provided some career transitional support, it wasnt at all at the level it should have been. Any questions we had around the process we were pushed into a generic ""ask HR"" email address that would get a response 3 weeks later, or not at all. Their never seemed to be anyone who knew answers or could provide help. We were constantly told to ""go to links"" for info. No personable feel at all. It was a terribly disconnected process and the communication was always broken. The right hand never seemed to be talking to the left. You were made to very much feel like just a number during the process and I could feel the growing curve from a small personable company to a cold tech giant company in which no one seemed to care what you did before the acquisition, or know how to help with anything. The culture started to drastically shift, which was sad. The IT onboarding process on our first day was terrible and I have never been treated so rude by IT people. After leaving, I was told my completion bonus would go in on a certain date, and it didnt. I spent hours back and forth with HR trying to get answers as to why that changed and was not communicated to me. On top of that, noone from HPE confirmed with the state the information I submitted for unemployment benefits, so I was left waiting for a response, and finally the state took it in their own hands to confirm the info with me so I could get my eligibility. I was very unimpressed that such a large company like HPe would not have a handle on taking care of the people affected by an acquisition layoff. Once again...they made you feel irrelevant and like a number. I expected more from a company of this size. It has nothing to do with getting laid off. It happens, its the corporate world we live in,but its about ethics, taking care of the people, and making the offboarding experience as easy as possible for those leaving. Didnt happen. It was a circus over there from the second they acquired us, and it was starting to ruin the great culture our company had into place before HPe came in and swallowed us up. I hope they can improve this experience for future situations like this, because I have such a bad taste in my mouth from HPe, I dont think I would ever work there or recommend them to other peers. Whats sad too, is they bought us because they couldn't beat us. I just hope they can carry the legacy and incredible work we did. There is a reason we were number one in our industry. Time will tell if they will carry our flag or sink our ship..

","HPE throws away their entire Q1 by making huge adjustments during the end of the calendar year, they pay their people under market for the roles they hire for, there's a level of ""playing the game"" internally that hinders the true top performers from progressing, the upper management hides behind the smoke and mirrors of executive privilege while they overwork and underpay all positions, there are fundamental alignment issues in sales teams, understanding what sales reps get paid on is more complex than rocket science, supply chain issues compound the already impossible quota attainment issues, and people threatening to leave are being rewarded with raises and roles in order to stay while more tenured folks on the floor are being paid less than those being hired fresh out of college.

This is all in conjunction with every role internally being converted, essentially turning the entire building into a call center.
Advice to Management
Learn to not divide your people in every way imaginable. The people you undercut will eventually leave for competitors and apply salt to the self-inflicted wound HPE has successfully acquired. This company has the potential to do great work, but it is the management internally that are hindering the success with a poor professional brand, abysmal decision-making, and an absolutely deplorable excuse for a start-up culture. Take a weekend and re-write the entire system, starting on page one.

","Same issue for past 15+years. The compensation program still not able to pin point who sold the solution. Can't really track effort to pay. People put up with it because there is nothing anyone can do. Enough people make bank on accounts that require little to no effort to keep the village happy. All based on revenue not margin.

2019-12-16, Senior Software Engineer,Bangalore,"Former Employee, more than 5 years",HPE - Aruba very good place to test your limits.,"I was with HPE for close to 5years, Joining as a Junior Dev Engineer and I was a Senior Software Dev engineer when I left.
I was part of HPE-Aruba networking BU so I will keep my review relevant to this BU alone.
Excellent place if you really like the development activity as part of your job.
This BU is always growing, innovating and looking to compete with the best in the industry, hence there is always lot of feature development opportunities for engineers.
There is a real scope of understanding standard as well as new technologies as there is so much work involved.
Pros as per me :
1) Excellent development work and great platform to learn and improve your knowledge with respect to Networking protocols
2) Very good and experienced seniors who have a overall knowledge in their respective fields
3) You can test yourself as you will be involved from the design phase to delivery for customer stage. You will understand the whole process very well.
4) Help is always available if you ask for it.
5) Decent Hikes year on year.
6) Management and leaders have a good vision of what they want in next 3-4 years.
","Though the company offers great oppurtunity to build career, it does have cons as I have seen. Here are the cons with the BU I worked :
1) No Work-Life balance.
2) There is a lot of obscure activity expected from the developers. Which could have been easily performed by other teams. This takes too much time other than the actual work being assigned and the worst part is it is these obscure activities are not even considered as work even if it takes a lot of time.
Hence the pressure is high on developers.
3) The process involved in getting a feature to completion is so tedious. It sometimes feels like developers are running the company.
4) Management is very much involved in micro-managing.
5) Other than working on technologies and becoming knowledgeable in the technology part, there is no career plan for employees.
It is like management just want you to work a lot but they have no plans to help build your career. 
6) Though it has decent hikes, the bonuses they offer on yearly basis is literally peanuts. Worst in the industry.
7) No Flexibility, no WFH options.
Advice to Management
1) Stop micro-management, trust your engineers to deliver the feature.
2) Improve compensation benefits.
3) Treat developers as humans, Please come up with a program to offload lot of the obscure activity which the developer is not equipped with to other teams. This helps the developers improve their efficiency.
4) Appreciate your engineers regularly, they work so hard. They deserve it.

Stop giving huge increments just for vow score, stop sending out skilled experienced employees who can scale up, there are non technical managers in the low and mid level, goofing up with numbers to show up green in metric than focusing on improving quality of support, manage operation cost by pay cut than firing skilled high paid employees.

Advice to Management
Pay attention to the staff, listen to them, understand the reason they reach out to you and try empathy. Not everyone works the same way, and there will always be personality conflicts in life. Work to better understand your people and what motivates them to push the needle vs. the need to push the needle and not understanding why is isn't.

-Upper management are clueless on what actually goes on 
-Management turning a sales org into a call center
-Managers micro manage on a daily basis 
-New tool every day that makes hard to keep up with all 
-This is territory based sales so you better be lucky other wise you are not making money 
-Field is over paid and inside is overworked and under paid 
-Account alignment was a joke in FY19 with unrealistic quotas and bad accounts that don t fall under correct segments
-Re org with out notice an people placement is unorganized 
-Reps who are praised either got lucky with accounts or they play the ""game"" your efforts does not matter at HPE 
-For a big company like HPE they sure have an HR department that is lost and out of touch with employees 
-do not expect to move up unless you suck up to management

2019-08-12, Installed Base Specialist,"Roseville, CA","Current Employee, more than 3 years",Company culture is fantastic (and still improving) but the work itself is not,"It is rare to truly see a company-wide difference when it comes to a new CEO but since Antonio took over we have really seen a difference in company culture.
There have been new benefits added like additional vacation, upgraded paternity/maternity leave, new events on site and ability to work from home. Just from a culture standpoint, this is the best company I've ever worked for and it is really appreciated that they are working to make it better.
","Tools, data and processes. Working in an installed base sales environment you need quick tools with data you know is accurate - we have neither. Our tools are so cumbersome and slow that to make a small/simple change to quotes it will take multiple days to complete. If I were to rate the company on how easy it is to do my job without internal roadblocks, I'd give it a 1 star. Supposedly they are working to fix some of these tools but from what I have seen, it is just a re-skin of the same tools we have.
Also, and maybe it is just my area, but it does not seem like there is a lot of room for growth internally. There is no natural promotion in my business unit.
Advice to Management
Find different ways to provide data. Don't provide the same data re-skinned. Find new ways to organize. We should be able to find information about what we sold a customer easily. Stop providing roadblocks for sales/account management. 

I understand that IB/Renewals aren't ""sexy"" but we keep the lights on.

Business Outlook
Pros
Base salary paid on time, work from home, flex-time
Cons
- Absolutely no vision, no understanding of the market, no products (only slides), no investment in new products;
- Product documentation is 10 years old or more (""nothing changed"")
- Bullying management and least skillful management I ever had
- Customers are being constantly lied and projects are delivered with years of delay
- There is NO HPE Cloud, NO IoT, nothing, regardless of the nice slides prepared by Marketing
- Unrealistic sales targets (10-15x vs. average of previous 3 years)
- Unrealistic expectations (""we want to be #1 or #2 in all markets"") - with no products and no investment in new technologies
- Internal divisions fight against each other and do not support common business

I have only one thing to say - stay away. You learn nothing, you get no value for your career. Unless you hold a Director or higher position - you are NO ONE. You're better off elsewhere.
Advice to Management
Stop lying customers. Stop bullying people. Start investing in products - you need to spend some to get some. Start firing morons. Shred off 3 management levels - there are more people doing nothing than people actually working. Get to work. Get a life.

2019-06-17, TAM,Singapore,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",Technical Account Manager and Critical Event Manager,"Totally flexible. Understanding leadership and management.

Unlike the competitors, The business strategy is quite open to include Hybrid cloud where public and private cloud can be almost any leading solutions. From traditional infrastructure to Devops, they have solutions to support almost every workloads - traditional and cloud ready. And the devices do top in TPC losing just a couple of benchmarks to Korean hardware.

They have strong focus on Data Science and everyday i see at least a full-house of resources working to build AI/ML solutions from the most expensive location on earth. This didnt happened by sitting on laurels but by careful acquisition of Aruba, Nimble, Cray, Qattrolab, Plexi , Simplivity BlueData etc
They started spending extensively on employees and started grabbing the top 10% talents which will surely be reflected in the brilliance and quality of upcoming solutions and products.
This company definitely holds a considerable share in all the future technology. 
So if you are doubting over a long term investment in-terms of your career, stocks or buying technology - do not hesitate. HPE will not let you down and that is in the DNA of the company.
The
","There is a slight bunch of senior managers who haven't got enough of the vision. Sometimes they happen to be in the most critical delivery pipeline and we lose all the hope of being at our best version. Rarely but definitely we still have to spend 3+ weeks to convince some managers that automation is beneficial. They are definitely the best managers, but they havent trusted and bought the vision sold by the experts above them. 
If you happen to be in such a team, please raise the voice through VOE. The management and HR do listen and take VOE seriously. This feedback loop is definitely working and kudos to HR for implementing it - its in progress but not perfect.
Advice to Management
Firstly ----Keep it up, thank you for making me proud to be an HPEian. 

Well, a lot of us know that these guys are doing above and beyond the mark to make HPE the best place on earth when it comes to Customer satisfaction and Innovation. 
I got the opportunity to listen to them casually and understand their strong belief system which is the driving force behind all these dramatic changes.

Im not delusional enough to think that i stand a chance to advice this brilliant management. But just an amber light warning that there are a few vents which may drain all the energy and efforts of you guys instead of reaching it to customers. I'm sure in this road towards total perfection, you guys will identify them and close it out.

","Low pay, zero promotion potential even for top performers, super reactive decisions by leadership that don't give any chance for a direction to work or take shape or see if it's going to work before another reactive decision turns it in another direction entirely, layoffs at the drop of a hat and for no reason that makes any sense to anyone affected, time off seems good until you realize they require you to use a week of it for the December mandated shut down, you're just a number and they have zero loyalty to loyal employees. They mask having a ""great culture"" with certain improvements that are long overdue, touting this awesome place to work and yet don't follow through with other things that matter even more, like leveling salaries and whatnot (they talk about doing this but it never happens). Get ready to be underpaid and laid off, because it's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when.

","Upper management has too many initiatives that they roll down to ISAMs. 

Directors make unrealistic promises to upper management which leads to management micromanaging sales reps to the nth degree which stops all productivity.
 
Field reps put in zero effort and are paid two and three times as much as inside reps even though they do not contribute to closed business. It’s demoralizing. 

The pay is below industry standard and is inconsistent across the floor.

Territory planning for FY19 was a mess and many reps are stuck with a quota that is too high for the number of accounts they have.
 
Your success is based on which manager you work for.
Advice to Management
Be more selective with the initiatives you want sales reps to focus on. They can do two jobs poorly or one job excellently. 

Do not promise upper management 150% for the segment when the segment was carelessly rearranged. 

Stop glorifying field reps who do not contribute to closing business. 

Quit micromanaging. You hired these reps. Trust them to do their jobs. 

Pay reps the industry standard. 

Take better care when mapping accounts and territories for FY20.

It is common to see several people doing the same work that they view is different from each other. Communication channels across organizations are poor.

The job function consists of 25% sales 75% support/management. Easy job to enter the technology industry. The people here are great, always willing to help, fun to work with etc. Lower management is young and easy to get along with. Tons of upward mobility because of industry standard turnover. working with channel partners creates an expansive professional network. work life balance is great. Very easy to play corporate politics.
","This is a very boring job. Internal processes are always changing so its hard to keep up. Change is constant. It seems as if the role changes every 6 months. middle/upper management does not fundamentally understand the role of an inside sales rep. HPE strategy is unclear and not defined. HPE places heavy emphasis on its enterprise run-rate business. We are getting killed in the small/middle market space by competition due to lack of resources and poor go to market strategy. Pay is garbage and confusing. HPE cannot figure out employee compensation and its concerning.
Advice to Management
Understand volume vs value compute and decide where you want to play in the market. The storage team internal structure is misaligned with its corresponding segments. Aruba is carrying the weight of struggling business units. gotta ""give to get"" management does not really care about this company and fails to motivate employees.

Furthermore, there are opportunities to grow within the company if you are interested in marketing or sales roles.
","The employee age range is on the very high end and most likely, only sales and marketing career opportunities will be available in the local country offices. 
From having been a solid long term employer one could pursue a career within, HPE has developed a global hub type of mindset with global hubs in Tunisia, Bulgaria, USA and India. In other words, all other type of roles than local sales and marketing should be considered short term and very likely to be subjects of the workforce reductions that have been ongoing at HP(E) for the last decade.

","Even if you are clearly the best performer, they may give promotions to people with more years at HP, so it is hard for newcomers to grow.
Language is a barrier for a lot of people. HP is famous for its acronyms. The same acronym may mean different things in different departments. HP has a whole wiki for all their acronyms.
WFRs (Work Force Reduction) - Periodically, HP mandate managers to lay off their bottom performers. In a strong or small team, a bottom performer may be significantly better than other employees in other teams. Even if the manager doesn't want to lay off the employees, this is usually non-negotiable. The company keeps losing precisous talent.
Advice to Management
Stop with the WFRs.
Formalize a rotational program (improves culture and processes).

Advice to Management
There is no formal career development process; I've seen senior analysts take 4+ years to be promoted one level whereas higher level executives are promoted once a year or so. Higher level executives get to go on all-expenses paid retreats with guests whereas lower-level employees are paid under the market and take years to be promoted. There is no regard to merit or prior accomplishments in this sense - you rotate after 24 months and you can only be promoted after 4 years - but this is not a guarantee. Frustrating work mostly surrounds correcting other (higher level) employees' work and having to pull together analysis with system crashes or crap data due to OS infrastructure from the 1990s. Also, we're a tech company but have no dedicated IT arm - that's all been outsourced to India. Also, my work is duplicated by Deloitte which for some reason is always in the building. It just seems like they have a couple hundred people at the top, thousands of apathetic/incompetent employees, and management keeps making retarded decisions. I for one am OUT.

Work from Home, Flexible work environment.

HPE has improved a lot when compared to earlier days in terms of salary and work.
Best colleagues and managers. In fact, the culture is very good compared to other product based companies. This may be due to HR policies.
STSD building is at a peaceful location away from traffic in Bengaluru. Upcoming metro station in front of the building will make commuting more convenient.
Wonderful campus with almost all facilities like gym, football, basketball, tennis courts, lawn, medical facilities, on-call doctor, cafeteria with subsidized food, playroom, etc.

2019-02-11, Manufacturing Ops Coordinator,"Houston, TX","Former Employee, more than 3 years",Great opportunity spoiled by poor management and selfish employees,"Competitive pay, Easy but fulfilling work, Day-Evening-Overnight shifts available, Great location, Free Parking garages,
 Various online training/courses available freely, A few great Supervisors, Open Door policy, Free food for overtime days, 
Free coffee, Full time hours.
","Often hostile work environment due to angry supervisors, All shifts were constantly pitted against each other for product output
 and caused resentment and complete division amongst shifts instead of a healthy team environment, Lots of lay offs,
 Floor workers were not respected by Office employees, Does not often hire internally and most supervisors know nothing about 
the manufacturing process and often derailed production due to their own misinformation or unwillingness to listen to more
 seasoned employees, Too many pointless meetings, Majority of contract and direct labourers did not care enough to work a minimal 
amount of work and constantly put down the company instead of trying to change the situation and give constructive criticism
 to management but unfortunately management probably wouldn't listen anyway, Employees would break tools, steal, and damage
 products or HP property just because, Blatant favouritism by management, Threats and warnings to fire employees, 
Unfair treatment by supervisors due to untrue rumours or assumptions, Training was basically non existent.
Advice to Management
Supervisors need to focus more on everyone being a team instead of setting up competition with threats of being fired or moving
 areas because of lesser numbers than other lines or shifts. Supervisors need to be more fair and considerate to all employees
 and keep emotions in check and especially stand up for the employees underneath them instead of throwing them under the bus to 
save themselves. Management needs to learn more about products, processes, and areas they're over so they can be better informed 
when making changes and communicating with their employees. Management needs to understand that proper training is crucial to
 solid work output and is a far better than giving minimal training. Focus less on how pretty the buildings look and more on
 functionality and practicality.

","- low morale
- detached leadership
- continuous failed promises about pay and progression
- unreliable middle management
- gossipy floor
- this tech giant is stuck in the 80s
- lack of accountability for scandals
Advice to Management
1. Invest in better management. Just because someone is top of the leaderboards doesn't mean they are going to be the best leaders. Managers stop progression and promotions of talented sales reps because they simply ""don't like them."" Hold them to a higher standard.
2. Focus on inclusion. All of my former coworkers who could be deemed unique or different were never fully accepted. When team members brought up the idea of recruiting more minorities and women, the idea was laughed at and brushed off in meetings with leaders. There is literally no plan to include all kinds of people in this company - very rare for a tech company. If you're a person of color or a woman, please think before you work here.
3. Race Issues. There were many incidents that were never addressed and it made the workplace highly uncomfortable. For instance, multiple white employees would use the n word and say problematic things as ""jokes"" in front of managers. Nothing was done. When the n word was written on the walls in the men's bathroom, the news went around the floor but leadership never addressed it. This was a weak and cowardice move.
4. Pay your people!!! You can't expect someone to work for a tech giant like HPE and get paid like they're at a start-up. If someone is being promoted, you have to compensate them fairly, not ignore their pleas. Also, pay people for all of their closed opportunities. It's not my job to calculate my commission check yet I was continuously doing the math and having to be ""rightfully paid"" for checks months late. This is why nobody stays here longer than a year or so here. You just get sick of the mistreatment and lack of progression.
5. Leaders not wanted. They only want submissive leaders here. If you have ideas or are looking to make a difference, they will get rid of you or put you a performance plan or threaten you with a bad territory/leads. Most leaders leave for this reason quickly.

- Decent Medical/Dental
","- Empty promises.
- Poor training.
- Managers with no Management experience.
- Lack of inter-departmental communications, every department is living on some island.
- Telling employees they are doing great and giving them some useless certificate of recognition but then telling them they are below average and not giving them a raise.
- No differential pay for people who work during non business hour shifts.
- Garbage ticketing system that belongs in the 1970's.
- Multiple VPN's that don't work when you try to work from home.
- Lack of direction.
- VP telling employees they are ""expandable"". 
- Some other VP quitting a day before visiting the office (big surprise)
- No pay for un-used PTO, no carry over for un-used PTO and not allowing the employees to use the PTO they earned. (So what's the point of having PTO?)

- Realize the job market is different now, they are a lot more jobs and people will leave if they are not treated right.

","Low pay, rarely get raises (talk about progression, but you have to interview for a raise), sales floor is like a giant frat house (so many cliques), HR doesn’t take complaints/cases seriously, inside sales team is stretched too thin
Advice to Management
1) Figure out comp. Continuously screwing people out of their money is one of the main reasons you can’t keep sales people for longer than a year.

2) Hire managers/directors and promote MORE CAREFULLY. Lots of bullying. The SMB team is by far the worst of the inside sales organization. SMB leaders take pride in tearing their employees down. They’re full of empty promises and lies. If you ask the same question a few days apart, you could get different answers. They are incredibly manipulative. If you speak up about concerns or struggles of any sort, they will flip it back on you and make you feel less of a person or guilty. All they want are “yes” men. There are many managers that have no business being managers.

3) Take HR cases more seriously. If a woman comes forward about sexual harassment, DO NOT make her feel like it was her fault. Address the situation and don’t sweep it under the rug.

Advice to Management
Invest in the offices - a dark, dingy working environment is downright depressing. Particularly when so much time is spent there.

Try to maintain continuity with regard to account alignments as this has a direct effect on your employees - bonus is paid on that basis, which is appalling.

Higher management are so disengaged with their staff and constant forecasting and processes hamper any/all selling activities. 

Invest in your staff, promote them, encourage them and try not to manage them out the door - too many good people are overlooked based on how nice they are to higher management.

Recommend
CEO Approval
Business Outlook
Pros
Overall a good organization to work for, with good working environment - but only as good as one's Manager/ Org Head
Cons
Pathetic, Inefficient & ineffective HR, Internal Moves just don't materialize
Advice to Management
Management should look into following issues:

1. HR is Pathetic, Inefficient & ineffective - actually it will be even better to say that the HR just does not exist here. Show is run by Managers & Their Managers...and HR just toes in their line..whether in terms on Appraisal, Bonus Payouts, IJPs or Retention.

No Team Activities or Outbound activities. Never saw a HR personnel for many years..not even during Appraisal Activity months of the year.

2. Internal Career Opportunities - whether Domestic or Foreign postings (IJPs), are just not provided & promoted (which again can be promoted by a Pro-active & Efficient HR). 

3. Bonus Distribution (Sales/Deal Win Bonus, Variable Component, etc), Increments & Promotions are all a big secret and no one ever gets to know as to who got promoted...!!!

Providing Internal Opportunities is a mere lip service (even though there are tonnes of IJPs listed, I never got a call..neither did hundreds of HP GlobalSoft India employees whom I knew).

If these issues are addressed, HP can be one of the best places to work.

","Way too much politics and meaningless internal marketing without real substance. Not everybody is up to a task but the existing human potential is much more valuable than the company itself. Strange case where a total is considerably less than a sum of its parts.
Turning back to roots (not really a good idea!) HPE is going back to predominantly being a hardware vendor with software and consulting services being totally neglected (although they will tell you a different story, but do not believe them; actions in the last 3-4 years clearly speak for themselves). It looks like they did not learn anything at all from the IBM story.
Apparent financial success does not reflect the reality because it's largely based on massive layoffs and closing down operations in many countries. This will once more buy some time but the reserves are very thin now.
Once a true giant and leader in the IT industry, this company has been disassembled and is now on its lowest level ever. Good people are leaving the company and with current ideas and leadership it can only go downwards.

To the higher management, give more flexibility to direct managers of employees in order for them to have more choice in how to improve the professional life of their top performers.

2018-11-04,Anonymous,,Current Employee,Good place to start,"The industry remains interesting and challenging. Most colleagues are hard-working.
","The company spent a lot of time in the last few years reorganizing, and more frequently in the last 4 years. I am concerned that this takes away from focus of employees, who are used to being 100% focused on customers, and constraints them to spend time on wondering if they will have a job after the latest wave, or looking for a job, or gossiping about what goings on. Change is inevitable in an organisation, but the rate of change at HPE has become very distracting. Sometimes feels like top management operates more and more with a focus on politics and keeping the job, rather than whether their work and the work of their teams is good for the customer.

The back office team are friendly and ultimately do everything they can to ensure your success
Starting to reduce redundancies
Everyone treats each other with a huge amount of respect - a lot like a family - which if you solve the below-mentioned housekeeping errors - will flourish further
","Lack of direction still remains prominent in some areas of the business, post-split
Acquisitions are not logically driven, burn time and a huge amount of cash. Acquire for strategic growth, not to impress shareholders
Small decline in market cap ($)
Average tenure declining - becoming a stepping stone rather than a company that invests in internal growth and longevity of those with the knowledge, IP and skills of the HPE solutions.
Internal integration between various BUs is lacking heavily - individual agendas - again, a very easy fix, but heavily weighted towards a mindset to cross-fertilise strategies among the various Senior Leadership Team members.

Advice to Management
Look at the talent right in front of you and stop looking for answers by blinding feeling out new interns that are literally along for a short ride and not the long term haul. You're losing employees that know multiple job positions because of the social club mentality going on here. When you have something that works, don't try to fix it by replacing it with something else that costs millions and usually isn't any better.

Also, some departments allow work from home a few days a week. In general, employees are trusted to do their work without any need of close supervision.
","Cost savings, cost savings, cost savings - the company has become one that is mostly about cutting the costs, so profits can be improved. Employees are promoted months, sometimes years, after they have started doing a certain job. What is more, salary is rarely adjusted, to match the new responsibilities. Pay raise is rare or it is insignificant. Supervisors do not know much about employees' success, still they have to rate employees once a year. That said, recognition is never received if you don't go and explain why you deserve it.

","Old school thinking, very hierarchical even if leaders are not providing much direction or value, lack of strategy and strategic guidance at Exec thru IC levels. They are not ethical when it comes to employee layoffs and payout of RSUs to employees. Negative culture.

Pros
HP used to be a great company with very specific positive culture, caring for employees, promoting and rewarding great performance. It was also on the cutting enge of technology and had a great portfolio of products and services. A strong consulting arm was clearly determined to enable and support the classical core business - hardware and software.
Cons
Since Carly took over as CEO, the way to the abyss started and has continued until today. The HP culture (HP Way) disappeared, management by excel introduced, relationships damaged. Focusing only on the ""core"" business, a.k.a. ""back to the roots"", destroyed many great values in the services and consulting business, formerly valued employees and great contributors pushed out.

They offer flexibility of working locations in some roles which is helpful.
","They have no focus on culture, equality and leaders do not appear to be accountable. Same mistakes or target misses happen yet leaders remain in post or get promoted.

Promotions are typically already agreed behind closed doors and then a pseudo process is run to try and demonstrate the decision is not already made. HR at there only to protect the organisation and not that of the employees. Leadership in U.K. is very clique and at best average in terms of talent outside of 1 or 2 exceptions. Many talented people have decided to leave but never an acknowledgement of this and what the organisation was doing to address this issue. A shame as the U.K. was booming both culturally and with a great talent mix only a few years ago.

","One of my co-workers was extremely racist against me and when I brought it up to HR, I felt as if the company was attacking me, instead of trying to help and it really hurt my career. **I apologize if this language is profane but it is the only way I can articulate what happened ** One of my co-workers learned that I was jewish and in a training meeting started to try to instigate an argument with racist rhetoric. He said ""The jews started WW2"" which I ignored. Later when another co-worker explained that I don't like the food in the cafeteria and preferred to eat out, he said ""Its cuz hes a jew.."". When I brought up the racist remarks to HR they seemed to insinuate that it was my fault. I really thought that HP was more open and inclusive to diverse people but in reality they will defend bigotry and hatred. I honestly liked my job there but I felt as if I was being bullied for my race.

","HP was doing a lot of reorganizations when I was there -- about one every 12 to 18 months. And every time, people would be laid off and then they would contact me and say ""your new job title is X and your new boss is Y"". I was typically thrown into jobs I had no idea what to do and no idea where to find out how to do them, and my manager was in another country. I remember one manager coming to the US and seeing what I was doing to try and get my job done and he was amazed at how hard I was making it -- just because I had no idea what to do.

","Company is not supportive of career growth or rotation unless you are in a senior business manager role. Great opportunities are given time and time again to non-Asian locals, management seem to have strong unconscious bias. Benefits are not great - not much leave, medical benefits are low. Number of days of leave is pathetic, and on top of that they force you to take year end shut down period from your annual leave.
Advice to Management
Invest in your talent more. Maybe you need to enforce a mandatory reshuffling of roles every 2-3 years at first, until people get in the habit of hiring based on charateristics and skills, not just on experience doing the exact same thing for the past few years. Stop promoting people just because they speak like you, give other racial profiles a chance in senior roles, even if they don't know how to PR speak.

","Internal transfers can be political and it's difficult to move without manager approval. Based on offshoring many positions, they have eliminated many of the higher salaried roles and if you are promoted, a salary increase is generally not provided. Based on the spin-off and divestitures, there is too much disruption to organizational structures. When people are laid off and are part of your effort, there is not notice or transition and you may be left with a gap. With layoffs, people are stretched thin and expected to do more without support.

","The C-Level mgmt only sees the company from a sub-orbital Level (150,000 ft level). This leads to stupid, tenure based layoffs resulting in severe loss of talent. Not a meritocracy at all. You can be the most talented individual on your team but be laid off because you haven’t worked there for 15+ years
Advice to Management
Start carring about talent and not about tenure. Stop celebrating tenure. If folks haven’t moved on for 40 years it’s a sign that your employment model isn’t weeding out the lifers. Lifers don’t protect or grow your bottom line.

2018-04-25,Anonymous,"Roseville, CA",Current Employee,"Not too bad, but not great.","Work-life balance is decent and there is potential for growth within the company. It is relatively relaxed and there are fun and interesting things to work on. The people are great to work with and there is an overall positive work culture.
","Compensation is definitely not as competitive as it could be. Overall employee benefits are average at best. Perhaps expected for a large, old company. Definitely not a company that attracts the top talent or perceived as a ""cool"" place to work. It's a job and that's mostly it, assuming your business unit hasn't been shut down yet. Bonuses - What are those? Stock rewards - only for the executives.
Advice to Management
The general consensus from those in the workforce is that there aren't many other options nearby, so people just settle for mediocrity - both in compensation, benefits, and performance. Work hard enough to get the job done and go home. Some people work harder, but they sure aren't being rewarded for it. While the company seems to be shedding divisions left and right, maybe this is to make the company nimble enough to one day pay attention to and keep high performing workers, attract better outside talent, and be a first-choice for new graduates rather than the left-overs.

Advice to Management
Motives between the CEO and the lowest level employees are very different. The CEO has some grand plan for success, but the plan does not connect the dots for employees. Employees are struggling to determine just how their role fits within the grand plan. Since the employees job does not change from one grand plan to another, it's easy to just ignore what the top level managers have to say about the future and the 'new' grand plan.

2018-04-20,Anonymous,"Dallas, TX","Current Employee, more than 3 years",Hit or Miss depending on your job,"HPE can be a great place to work depending on what you do at the company.
All employees get great benefits. Our vacation, pto, health insurance, etc are quite good. We also get employee discounts on just about everything under the sun (cell phone plans and car lease/finance discounts are the best).

You also have the flexibility to change roles often ( you can move around in as little as every 1-2 yrs). Theres a good amount of internal postings to consider.

And working in sales I do get the chance to travel on occasion, but vendors/partners do come in often. So there's always free lunches/dinners/happy hours/prizes/etc to be had. 

We also hire lots of college grads for entry level jobs, all the way up to highly experienced people for more senior roles.
","I've only worked in sales so i cant speak on other functions but heres whats wrong with our department. It can be VERY hit or miss in sales at HPE: 

First off is pay. I've been here 4 years, and 3 of which they've messed up my pay at least once per year. The one year they didnt was only because I was salary then! The internal tracking system to measure quota attainment is literally never right (and been publicly ridiculed), and takes too long to be updated/corrected. One year I was even on draw since the software was so messed up that it took them about 7 months to pay me back owed commission. Pay is also mediocre given our industry. Pay in other companies (especially cloud and software is much better.

Then comes territory/quota. This is also very hit or miss. You might hit the ""lottery"", and get a territory where you dont have to do anything and you can hit multipliers. Or, you can get a bad one where its near impossible to hit your numbers. 

We're also constantly changing, but not in a good way. I know change is inevitable at any job, but its bad here. Ive had 4 different managers, 3 VP's, moved desks 10+ times, worked in 2 different buildings (and soon to be 3) all in 4 years. That doesnt even include all the job restructuring and comp changes either. We just cant seem to find anything that works right.

Last but not least, turnover is extremely high. Its no wonder so many sales reps leave in less than a year.
Advice to Management
1. Get compensation figured out. Pay us better, correctly, and in a timely matter.
2. Pick a plan and stick with it for longer than a quarter. 

You'd think a college grad hit the jackpot landing their first job at HPE, but when they leave in less than a year this is why. I hear it from them daily. Fix these and turnover will be much less.

• The company is too top heavy based on the drastically reduced company size; they need to flatten and simplify the organizational structure.
• Too much red tape and process to accomplish goals in targeted timeframes. 
• Constant layoffs and re-orgs disrupt business. Direction is never clear. 
• Talent is never evaluated in layoffs and typically high performers in key areas are hit.
• NO work/life balance and HUGE expectations. Not enough people to do the work and employees work excessive hours to accomplish goals with little to no recognition/reward.
• Nearly impossible to obtain market parity in salaries – increases are dismal at best regardless of level of accomplishments.
• Little to no upward mobility
• NO remote worker policy any longer which seriously limits their pool of qualified candidates and opportunities for current employees.
Advice to Management
They know what to fix, they've been doing yearly employee surveys for more than a decade with similar feedback, but nothing ever changes. They need new blood from an executive standpoint, leaders who know how to inspire an entrepreneurial approach that truly motivates employees as well as recognizes and rewards goals achieved. 
For God's sake, STOP the constant re-orgs! It is highly demotivating, devaluing, and disruptive to customers and employees alike. They can't keep ringing out profit on the back of the workers. Give highly paid advice time to work.

Work/life balance was generally good.
","Lots of churn, including layoffs and replacing high-value team members with cheap (offshore or new grads) who weren't equipped to perform at that level. Not fair to them and not fair to the team.

""New month, new re-org"" became a thing in the year or so leading up to the Software spin-merge.

Too many WFRs smelled like age discrimination.

Compensation was stagnant and not tied to individual performance.
Advice to Management
1. HPE never found its way after splitting off from HP. They finally admitted that they didn't understand software, which is good, and the spin-merge had promise, but they put the same old guard that didn't understand software in charge of software going forward with the new company, dooming it. My advice is: when you're in over your head, ADMIT IT (no shame!) and ask the experts on the team for guidance, even if they aren't execs. The leaders in your software org had tons of relevant knowledge and experience and you neglected that valuable resource, to the detriment of everybody in the software org.

2. Stop living quarter-by-quarter and spinning tales for the stockholders. They know enough to spot BS, and meanwhile you lay off good performers and assume you'll back-fill them later with no cost in product quality or schedules -- unrealistic. But you let people who are well-connected slide by and spend huge amounts of money on boondoggles like Discover. None of this sends encouraging messages to employees.

","Slow. Beaurocratic. Unrealistic. Red-taped.

I came from a much fast-paced environment so how things run internally at HPE shocks me. While HPE has tried to change its strategy recently, it's not enough. Mutilpe layers of management and blanket decisions made from the top who are so far away from reality just makes everything worse for day-to-day workers.

While the ongoing cost-cutting effort HPE is needed to turn around the business, it was so implemented in a stupid fashion that it actually hurts the company in the long term. There are painful decisions to be made but they should be selective and well-thought. So far, HPE fails at this and loses its best employees.

While Meg stepping down is a good thing as I personally don't think she brought any significant value to HPE, not sure what Antonio can do in the future to turn the tide around if core problems can't be addressed properly.

3. Inform your reps about mistakes that were made by upper management; we will find out and we will call you out on it. It would be better to just tell us up front.
4. Don’t expect the ERG’s to produce the culture in the office when you won’t even provide them a budget.(Fun costs money shocker I know)

Business Outlook
Pros
I had a good 10 years with HP, HPE and various other company names over those years.
Cons
After many years of treating employees well, for the last 3 years or so they have been 'restructuring'. What the restructuring translates to is that they have devalued their employees. They have been having periodic WFRs offloading employees of long standing to replace them with lower cost alternatives.

I got a minimal severance as a remote support engineer but recent jettisons have not been as kind. 'Field engineers' were most recently unceremoniously dumped earlier this month.
Advice to Management
It is probably too late now but upper management should remember what gave them value. As Bill and Dave used to say, ""Our greatest asset is our employees"". That no longer seems to apply as they are outsourcing everything they possibly can as soon as they can.

2018-03-21,Anonymous,,"Current Employee, more than 10 years",Definitely not a place to have a career anymore,"The only pro I have for HPE is it's history. Where the company came from and all they've accomplished. I use to have enormous pride when I told people, I work for Hewlett Packard. All that's changed
","They are not the same company anymore. They split from their personal computers and printers side of the company. They sold off their internal I.T. Dept. And 3 others depts as well. They've laid off and ungodly amount of employees. Some that have been with the company for 3 to 4 decades. They've systematically broken several support teams to the point where we are unable to properly do what should be our main goal, actually help and assist our customers. It's clear to me that the go forward strategy with HPE is not to look out for the employees or help the customers. It's to carve out pieces of the company little by little so it's small enough to be sold off. So why in the hell would I want to continue working for a company that acts like this?
Advice to Management
Honestly, the damage has been done. I know HPE will never get back to where we were in the industry. We were too little, too late in alot of different ways. All I would tell management is just be honest with your employees and let us know what's really going on. Let us know if we should be looking for other jobs. Because if HPE is not planning on selling off than why in the hell are these idiotic decisions being made?

","Company can’t get out of its own way. Broken metric systems promote the people that fluff numbers opposed to those busting their butts.
Advice to Management
Create a system where positions are earned and not given to those that tell you how hard they are working. The company is filled with great people who burn themselves out trying to cope with processes built for a much larger company than we have become. Micro management has never been successful, just leads to churn and burn type work environments.

2018-03-10, Inside Sales Account Manager,,Former Employee,Behind the times,"Good benefits and employee resource programs. They allow a certain number of hours per year to be used towards volunteer initiatives.
There's also different training videos available that employees can take on their own time.
","Several. Operationally speaking, many processes are slow, moreso than need be. Most significantly, they have a long standing reputation for issues with employees receiving their sales commission on time, and sometimes at all. The task of looking into one's commission (tracking and claiming missing commission) is quite convoluted - to the point where it's been said on many occasions that sales persons felt the company made it so difficult and take so long in hopes that they just give up and stop requesting their commission that is being claimed/debated (this is just a feeling). There's published articles however, in online resources and outlets that detail this continent wide pay issue.

There's an obvious clique mentality where opportunity is more available to those within the clique vs those who are not but are excellent employees.

Employees within the same roles are not provided the same salary pay, despite at times some employees in a given role having more experience than the next. Additionally the salary in some positions are beneath industry standards/averages for the same or comparable roles in other organizations. 

Finally, personal employee information is often shared outside of appropriate avenues. Either from HR or at management level, private and personal details have been shared and unfortunately spreads.
Advice to Management
Many of these negatives can be avoided if the company makes a genuine commitment to improve employee satisfaction and internal operational efficiency with integrity. Be open to constructive criticism. Ensure salary is the same across the board per the role, or within reasonable frames, or based on experience coming into the role.
Treat others the way you would want to be treated. For a company of this size and global recognition, it should be leading the way in many if not all of these areas I have touched upon.

Flex time.
Work from home.
Free parking.
","This is a 'bargain basement' IT services company that invests the absolute bare minimum in their staff. You have to search far and wide for anyone within the company that actually has anything good to say about it. There are a lot of trainees (that replace good staff that are constantly leaving) that stay for 18 months to 2 years to get the name 'Hewlett Packard CDS' on their CV (it may be wholly owned by Hewlett Packard but its NOTHING like the parent company). Training almost appears to be a 'swear' word in this place but your constantly told that how much the company invests in staff training... I'd like to know where they measure this since it is clearly inaccurate!!
This company has the most frustrating 'job architecture' and they continue to not give you any salary banding for roles (although this has been asked for by 'the workforce' surveys many times).
Purchasing anything is a mammoth task. Nothing happens quickly and the level of justification needed is just insane.
Advice to Management
Pay your good staff what they are actually worth and encourage them to think outside the box. One of the many problems with this company is that upper management are so untrusting of their staff and its run more like a primary school. If you look at a lot of tech companies they employ good people that they rely on to make a difference to the company - there is no point employing someone with lots of good ideas and can think outside the box when they're told 'no - do it like this' and 'stop thinking outside of the box' - this is IMHO exactly why you have a BIG turnover of staff!!
Please Please Please act on employee feedback - voice of the workforce seemingly is completely ignored (when it ran) in addition to leavers comments in exit interviews (I know of at least 2 others who put poor pay on their exit questionnaires!) and yet touching base with some of my ex colleagues they confirm no pay rises continue to be a 'feature'.

2018-03-04, CSC L1 Engineer,Leixlip,"Former Employee, more than 5 years",Management issues (CSC),"-Large company = Big support network. You'll always have someone to go to, if there's something you don't know yourself
-Lot's of career opportunities, if you play your cards right. 
-Best in class products
","-Large company = Some people could easily feel like a small piece in a very large puzzle. It can be disheartening depending on your personality. By all means, if you want to be that average guy/girl that wants a 9-5 job, average pay, this could be the perfect place for you. 

-Upper management has no appreciation for customer service, not even in the higher levels L2/L3 (Bangalore and Houston). They are severely underpaid and overworked, and when you work there, you basically feel like a liability to the upper management. Of course you get the occasional suit visiting your center, saying how important you are, but at the end of the day salaries offered are well below industry average.

-Salary levels is below industry average. Some managers will often cite ""You can feel lucky you get to work with the products in the business""

-Staffing models is broken. In my center, they only hired the bare minimum to just about keep up with the incoming volume of calls and cases, if we were fully staffed. Thing is, we are all human. People get sick, need holidays, need training. So if you work in CSC, you can expect to have to work your as* off every single day. This constantly sets off a bad chain of events as people calling in sick because of a stressful job environment. That also leaves the remaining people that actually works, with an even higher workload.

-If someone is performing extremely bad, like not technically fit for his/her job and not doing much and has a very bad attitude, management will do little or nothing about it.
Advice to Management
-Raise average salary for workers in CSC. This will attract better talent and more motivated workers.
-Change your staffing models. They don't work
-Train your managers to handle difficult situations like when employees starts to underperform or call in sick twice every week.

Focus on supporting the teams who are customer facing. Stop going on jollies with clients and allow teams to use that travel fund. Listen to staff and try to implement their ideas - Less of a dictatorship mentality, train staff, more honest appraisals.

2018-02-06,Anonymous,,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",Disappointing company to work for,"I lasted with HPE just over a year. The direct team (specifically my peers) I worked with was wonderful. Everyone was always willing to help one another. It was one of the only reasons why I stayed with the company, albeit a short time.
","I had hoped to stay at HPE long term but unfortunately, there were several red flags that caused me to jump ship. First, my direct manager never supported our team. Because of this, myself and my teammates could not do the job we were hired to do. We were supposed to be the ""voice"" for our external customers, only to have our ideas ignored and swept under the rug . On staff calls, when we had concerns, we were told it was not the right forum to be bringing them up (still shocks me to this day). This hampered our ability to think creatively and outside of the box because everyone felt like it was a waste of their breath. The team I was on had so many talented, smart people and we were never leveraged to the fullest of our capabilities. Second, our team ended up taking on responsibilities that were not even part of the scope of our role. A lot of things were thrown at us at the very last minute causing extreme stress and frustration. The straw that broke the camel's back for me was the extreme micromanaging done by the direct manager and that manager's manager. It was an incredibly terrible environment to be working in (even though our team was remote) to the point that I no longer enjoyed my job.
Advice to Management
Make sure you hire managers (especially with direct reports) and executive management, who are open to hearing feedback (good and bad) from their team and do not shut them out. Make sure that they want their team to be collaborative, to share ideas and concerns among one another without feeling like they will be reprimanded.

I worked with some of the very best people around, both professionally and personally ... until they were laid off and replaced by young, unskilled, inexperienced people who do not know enough to make sound decisions.
","Management doesn't value loyalty, hard work, knowledge and experience. Rather, they care about cutting costs through layoffs and replacing workers offshore. They are replacing valuable, knowledgeable and experienced long-time employees with brand new people in low-cost countries with very few skills who have no loyalty to the company, HP's reputation or level of quality. All of that has decreased in recent years since Meg started on her quest to ""trim the gray hair"" company-wide and send jobs outside the US, where HP was founded. Meanwhile, the execs take multimillion dollar bonuses in money, stock and other incentives while long-term, loyal employees lose their jobs, their homes and have to re-plan their retirements.

Work-life balance is horrible with all of the layoffs and all of the inexperienced workers. Everything is done the hard way, nothing the smart way.

","The company culture has decayed from vibrant and exciting to dry and depressing. There is a constant threat of being laid off, even for highly-skilled, experienced employees. Management has no idea which direction they want the company to go in, so goals are often unfocused and seemingly pointless. The office environment has moved to an ""open concept"" seating arrangement, which is not only horrible for employee focus and comfort, but also employee trust in their managers. Jobs are constantly being outsourced to places like India or Brazil where the employees are cheaper but vastly less capable. Our small team in the US was responsible for fixing all of the mistakes that Brazilians had made in our software. These people can be smart, but they have no respect for accepted conventions or best practices.

Quit outsourcing software work. You'll save money if you don't have to hire people in the US to undo their mistakes. Restore employee privacy in the workplace and stop the constant layoffs to improve employee morale immensely.

It is clear that the company is struggling with finances. Morale would improve a bit if there wasn’t such a contradiction in how money is being spent. Case in point, no yearly bonuses were given company wide for 2017 because of lack of funds, yet the company continues to plan travel for meetings that can be held over the phone/Skype.

","Management is still mostly from Legacy HP, Compaq, Digital era and maintain that old mindset. 

Hardly any 'fresh blood' in influential positions. 

As generous employee perks have fallen by the wayside in the whole industry over the years, most managers are treating it as a 'job for life' and that hardly inspires revolutionary or evolutionary thinking or provide opportunities for innovators to get into positions to make a real difference.
Advice to Management
Don't allow production managers to create the matrix with which their bonuses are calculated, 'yield' sounds good but in practice, it's all just 'smoke and mirrors'. 

Link management bonuses more to customer feedback, not on if it left the factory on time.

Charge all 'internal' support costs for new orders within 6 months of delivery, directly to the 'production' budgets - that'll drive up production quality and refocus the company on the customer 'experience', which is more important than hitting revenue in the long term.

Vision is good (execution is not). A strong engineering company with a great portfolio, and promising acquisitions filling in gaps.
","Process is king here. Execution is very poor. It's near impossible to get anything done at a normal pace, and the silos are mind boggling. The marketing organization gets blown up every year, yet no one (management) takes it upon themselves to actually put the pieces back together again, and make any sense of it. Rinse and repeat year after year. What a mess. Reorgs are common and often necessary however at HPE, what follows is a weird blend of chaos and inertia. Morale here is the worst I've ever encountered due to rolling work force reductions.
Advice to Management
EXECUTE. Do your jobs and actually try managing the change you prescribe. There is an art to change management, hire some people who master it. Throw out your clunky home grown BI tools and utilize those developed by experts who are not motivated to keep their archaic systems in place to keep their jobs. Hold your ad agency and the team managing many millions of dollars accountable. Save some money on media buys and implement some new marketing tools in place of marketing ops people to trim the fat vs. just cutting people across the board.

","Working here is like working for a government constantly feeding you BS propaganda. The higher ups are never truthful with employees about anything, and your direct manager is also probably being lied to by everyone above them. 

The morale in the office I worked in was abysmal, even I first started back in early 2016, before everybody was being let go. The people who were here suffer from Stockholm Syndrome, as they're almost all over 40 and feel like they can't get work anywhere else. 

The company doesn't reward it's own employees, as I got a 1% raise after my first year. Turns out everyone on my team got a 1% raise at the same time because HPE couldn't afford to give out any more. When I was WFR'd in October of 2017, I figured I was being given an opportunity to move on. My next position had a 20% salary increase over what HPE had been paying me...

Also the companies products tend to be incredibly broken and the teams producing new releases are so beyond and mismanaged, it's a wonder they have anything that WORKS on the market as of now. I would avoid this company at all costs as it would a complete SHOCK if they were in business still, within the next few years...

Stop lying to employees, start being TRANSPARENT, start making smart decisions instead of cutting your nose off despite your face. Stop allowing off shore development to ruin all your products, stop selling broken products, stop killing off product lines in favor of ""new"" untested BS. Or maybe, just shut the company down and stop disappointing everyone.

Pros
Brand name gives a bloated sense of ego. Freedom in work timing. Zero mentoring.
Cons
Over-hiring Freshers and putting seniors on bench. Tech-savvy workforce is lacking. Clueless managers will push developers to upgrade testing skills because they themselves don't understand basic technology. Over-populated with non-technical,fat package managers and untrained freshers with peanut salaries. Sinking ship.
Advice to Management
Train freshers and yourselves. Stop fooling , arm-twisting and lying to customers. Stop treating HPE as your inlaw's house and learn some professionalism. Too many managers quarelling among themselves instead of doing valuable work. Abusing freshers will not make them deliver value. Give quality and focused trainings.

2017-12-11, Systems Software Engineer,Bangalore,"Former Employee, more than 5 years",Systems Software Engineer II,"I worked as developer in the ESSN, Servers management and Storage solutions team in my almost 5 years at HPE R&D Bangalore (Mahadevapura).

Good Work Life Balance.
Some of the projects are really good to work on.
Opportunities are great if you work hard(or be sincere to your work).
Good Employees are always recognized.
Employee facilities are good, but they still need improvements.
People and team with whom i worked with was good.
Many loyal employees with lots of experience in HPE.

Personally, i got an opportunity to work on the end-to-end stack of Software. And also got an opportunity to work on each phase of SDLC of a software product.
","Somehow the company concentrated more on legacy products.
Some of the facilities at office could have been improved.

Sadly they are running the company into the ground.
Advice to Management
The board of directors should clean house. Though, I suspect that the next move that will happen will be they will get bought by a company that sees the value of their products and employees and hopefully the new company will get rid of the people at the top that have decimated a once great company. Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard must be turning over in their grave to see what current management has done to the company.

If you are lucky enough to get a good project, it can teach you along with good atmosphere and infrastructure.
Nice campus.
Good for people looking for a settled job.. not much work pressure.
","Doesn't have lots of projects.
Most of the time you will be either on bench or in some support project.
Salary not incremented on yearly basis. They do it once in two-three years that too they increase because of inflation standards.
Randomly things are happening.
Few employees are there since 10+ years and their work is only to hit on young and fresher girls.
Not good at all for starting your career. 
Company keeps merging with one or another. Not a stabled one.
Managers are made based on there no of years in company. They put there personal frustation on employees talking to them in a really rude way.

HPCDS/FDS give false promises to new starters. No pay rises, no bonus and no training. You cannot continue an IT company if you do not invest in your staff, something this company does not do.

Management favor individuals

Support staff, and give them stability instead of threatening them with redundancy each quarter.
Allow your managers to make decisions, without everything being decided on from above. Allow lower level managers to actually manage a budget instead of dictating to them always from above.
Pick a plan and stick to it, without changing direction every month or so.

","At first, this seemed like a good acquisition then massive layoffs and split to HPE and HP Inc. Work escalated as there was no plan to manage the work with fewer people. Numerous changes yet management levels remained the same impending production and performance. Benefits went from okay to lacking, HR was totally unresponsive to the worker and very arrogant to our needs. It seemed they were there to do corporate bidding, reduce benefits, pay not to competitors and raises almost nonexistent unless you were very high up. Basically, they were and from what I hear of those still there they continue to tailspin and lack direction and leadership.
Advice to Management
You can't expect the same product with such deep cuts at the engineering and project/product management levels. If you want such deep cuts then remove the management layers, farm out your HR, improve the employee benefits, reduce at the top end. Find someone that is less interested in self-promotion and more interested in making HP what it once was a trusted brand backed by engineer excellence.

Business Outlook
Pros
When the benefit packages were there: Rewards program where you can use points to ""purchase"" HP equipment. Health insurance was always top notch. My People Managers, as well as my ITO leadership was always the best in ITO Services! I will always miss working with my network team members.
Cons
Constant layoffs constantly affected morale. Account Executives with a bloated sense of value and given too much say in a decentralized, leveraged account. Online HR ticketing to fix account profile issues always seemed to be in limbo without status updates. The internal training opportunities were always computer based training with little more than power point recorded slides & content that were mostly dated.
Advice to Management
Take all sexual harassment and assault claims seriously. Stop blowing them off for the sake of profit when your turnover & history of inability to hire and keep people has been historically shown. When you have people who are still employed as managers & executives refused transfer to other state projects, constantly toxic to the work environment because of their reputation & repeated complaints from employees, sets a standard that harassment will continue because the accuser (and witnesses) are dismissed by the same ""leaders.""

Stop changing job titles to gibberish that the common person can't understand what the title means or responsibilities: ""ITO Svc Delivery Cons III"" - Systems Administrator/Engineer is much more commonly understood and less marginalized. 

Sadly, the people who read this now will likely be laid off within two years and won't be able to address the issues long term.

2017-11-04,Anonymous,Sydney,"Current Employee, more than 10 years",No longer a great place to work,"Colleagues; I've made some good friends.
","The past few years of splits, acquisitions and continual layoffs has left everyone with change fatigue.
Overall long term strategy is communicated to an extent, albeit piecemeal, at an overall company level but poorly communicated and executed at a department level.
Most business decisions are made at corporate level with little autonomy or ability to effect much change at a country level.
Poor attention to developing people, mentoring or providing training within each role and little guidance or feedback from direct management.
Work environment used to be flexible but working from home now is generally frowned upon and staff treated as if they're not to be trusted unless they're in direct line of sight. Staff are just numbers.
Lip service is paid to employee engagement with various programs but management rarely put in appearances and very, very few will put any of their own effort or even simple vocal endorsement behind them.
Staff amenities are cut further and further. Don't expect a Christmas party, there hasn't been one for years.
Advice to Management
Put some effort into developing proper processes, role development and education. Really, properly train your people - particularly first time managers who are generally fumbling around trying to make sense of it all.
Stop treating your employees like errant children.

2017-10-30, Network Engineer,"Alpharetta, GA","Current Employee, more than 1 year",Only if you have no alternatives,"There used to be good things about this company, but not so much anymore.
Pro's: 
-- It's a paycheck.
-- Decent dental and vision coverage.
-- Decent learning resources and paid for certifications.
","-- Company does not honor their contracts to their employers but will fire you if you look for alternative sources for income. They literally converted me from a salaried to an hourly employee despite my contract slating to to a salary.
-- Does not pay very well for the work involved. The work is worth about $65 - $70k annually but you will be lucky to see $45k.
-- Medical benefit is absolutely horrible. The only available plan has a high deductible of which you will not meet within a year and must be paid before even general exams and doctor visits are covered.
-- Absolutely NO Job security. Even if you get your certifications they WILL lay you off with absolutely no warning.
-- Completely unorganized and expect your role to change about 20 times a year, no exaguration.
--If you're hired as a full time employee, you're going to be replaced by a contractor. If you're hired as a contractor, you're going to either receive bare minimal compensation or be terminated at the slightest mishap, or both.
-- Certifications they offer are absolutely worthless in the real world outside of HPE, they hold no weight or value to anyone except HP, unless you get the Aruba certs.
--Does not provide clear and concise learning material for even obtaining the above and mentioned certifications...
--If you're in a pinch, need overtime, need additional income, need help, expect them to be the first one to throw you under the bus. 
--Despite what they say, there IS no moving up. There were several qualified candidates for Tier II, but Tier II is reserved for either brand new hires or a very small click. There have been candidates who were well qualified for it trying to get into it for years.
-- Negotiate your salary WISELY from the start. If you're on-boarded with a low salary, expect it to stay low for a very long time. Their annual raise percentages are lower than the increase of annual inflation.

2017-10-23, Information Tester,"Olympia, WA","Former Employee, more than 1 year",Horible Work Ethics,"It's a job. They had heat.
","No belief in personal time. No work ethics. I hated working with the management. They were impossible to find unless I walked down the street to the Starbucks. They would come back at 3pm and issue out work for the day and expect you to stay until you finished it regardless of how long it took 9pm or 2am even if you arrived at 7am. Every weekend we were on call, and would have to come in for a few hours to show we were a team player. However if the management did their job this would not have been needed.
Advice to Management

New company direction to focus on key hardware and IT solutions for the SMB and the enterprise

New company promises to be more agile and quicker at execution due to less overhead 

R&D budget for growth areas in server and storage are still generous, giving engineers the right tools to work with

Worldwide partner pre-sales network is far reaching 

Global travel opportunities for the appropriate job functions
","The last 6 years has been a roller coaster of layoff cycles

More company acquisitions and less internal innovation. 

All employees must work from an office location, even if their virtual team is spread around the world, they are the only one in their location, and their role is 100% doable from home (or remote locations)

Spin off of software, services, and even some hardware development has had some effects on benefits. This years group health plans are not as comprehensive as previous years 

I have seen several pre-sales engineers with a wealth of technical expierence and work ethic get let go not on performance, but because their job was in the wrong location at the wrong time and a salery cut number had to be met. 

Salary increases and bonuses have been minimal to none over the last 3 years

","Meg cut a lot of positions which impacted a lot of families, based on a focus of reducing expenses through cutting people rather than focusing on adding value through people. As with many publicly traded companies, Leadership is short sighted and not able to adequately assess the value of contribution or determine areas of profitability to get the ROI required for each employee. She chose the path to cut employees and shrink the company to size she could lead and manage.

2017-10-09, Inside Sales Representative,"Plano, TX","Former Employee, more than 1 year",Inside Sales--- more like Inside Secretaries or Inside Politicians,"-Quality products: HPE truly revolves around innovation. They have great products that you can support. They have been making a lot of strategic acquisitions, very prime for HPE. 

-Resume builder: beneficial to have a fortune 50 company on your resume 

-Schedule: work 8-5 and you're done. They don't want you working after hours because they don't want to pay overtime. Great work/life balance.

-Vacation/PTO: ISRs get a great amount of hours for just starting at a company.

-Partner Spiffs: partners throw quarterly incentives. You have the chance of getting various products/gifts/gift cards which is always nice.
","I'd like to start off by saying that I am a former Plano ISR who hit their quota and was in the top half of the Leaderboard so Inside Management can't attribute this post to being from an angry ex-Conway employee or a low-performing, emotional ISR...HPE Inside Sales is Toxic.

""People don't leave companies, they leave management.""

-Inside Sales Culture: dismal and defeating are just a couple words to describe the inside sales environment. Anyone who offers a suggestion, highlights an injustice, or simply voices their opinion in a respectable and professional manner is immediately reprimanded and disregarded or even put on a performance plan with no viable justification. Management cares more about reps wearing jeans on Tuesday than they do your quota attainment or commission checks not being paid! (HPE officially and legally has proclaimed they do not have a dress code by the way). Management says the leaderboard is the true determining factor of a successful sales rep. They'll reprimand you for being low on dials or Talk time, yet never applaud you for overachieving on quota attainment. 
Management has clear favorites and choose to openly show it. ""All men created equal"" does not apply here at Inside sales! I have never witnessed a more openly biased environment of managers blatantly showing their favoritism or hatred for certain ISRs. There is such a high turnover for a reason. You will only be successful based on how many fake dials you make in a day, how many 'partner sent' opportunities you send in a week to mandated partners (even if they're unqualified opportunities), and how much you suck up to management... not actual quota attainment, your book of business, drive, or rapport being built with end clients and Channel partners!



-Daily mandates: as an ISR you're pulled in many different directions. Management will issue one order then change it by lunchtime. There is no consistency. They say they want you to sell but really they want you to play politics. Upper management makes unofficial deals with partners to pass a certain amount of opportunities to them per quarter. The ISRs are forced to comply even if these partners aren't who the end client wants to work with. One Member of upper management mandates that ISRs send unqualified opportunities to partners to skew his numbers in a positive light. He treats the ISRs, CEMs, and ISDMs as scapegoats. He is scattered and dismissive in tone to his Subordinates. 



-Pay structure (or Lack there of): Commission has issues every year I'm told...I only stuck around for a little over my one year mark. One can only hang around for so long after not getting paid properly. There are multiple Business Insider articles over the years on how deplorable HPE MYCOMP is. So many people have open HR cases that aren't getting resolved. HPE is UNDERPAYING its employees as they keep withholding accurate commission checks. If HPE were overpaying us, they'd resolve these issues ASAP. How can a Top Fortune 50 company like HPE not implement a legitimate and efficient compensation platform? Inside Sales Management ignores it or makes you feel insignificant for caring about your next pay check. 


-Lack of Promotions: HPE is investing heavily in Inside Sales, which while great for Inside Sales, correlates to cutbacks in Field positions. When you interview, they'll highlight the career path of moving into the field. But with 250+ ISRs (a majority of which were hired on at the same time), there won't be that many field openings when you hit your one or two year mark. Management will also highlight the Progression structure with HPE offering pay increases....this is a dangling carrot. The ability to get paid and promoted is not as easy as they say. You could make every criteria but if you miss a progression training because they didn't offer it to you or you were sick or on vacation, they hold it against you and won't promote you! 



-One member of Upper Management serves as a wickedly brilliant oppressor who is impossible to get hard evidence on for any potential HR case. He will manipulate and alter your words to break you and meet his agenda. When asked a direct question, he will avoid the answer like a politician. He will say one thing then his message will change completely the next day, and he'll verbally and publicly humiliate you for being confused by a diluted and inconsistent message. He is very hard to work under/for. He was a strong catalyst in why I left the company. He is not an inspirer nor a leader; he is a nonsensical bully who stifles creativity and passion. 

Lastly, I'm told by former coworkers who are still at HPE that he's aware of this low extremely glass door rating and is incentivizing reps and directors to go write false-positive reviews (any review that is 5 stars for Inside Sales is one that's been bribed to post)
Advice to Management
People don't leave companies, they leave managers. A majority of inside Sales management has decided that 'managing up' and playing politics was more important than managing and leading their sales reps. 

HPE ISDMs--- PLEASE truly lead and inspire your reps, and above all don't keep us in the dark; please explain the reasoning why on certain mandates/justifications so we understand what we are being forced to do. Speak up when wrongdoings are done by the VP, the Directors, etc. Be an advocate for your ISRs. Also, please continue pushing upper management to resolve MyComp. I know it's out of your hands directly but the more you press the issue, the higher chance HPE works to resolve it.

My advice to ISRs is to network. While Inside Sales is a hard environment, HPE as a whole is a great company full of positive influencers. There are many great leaders within HPE, you just need to network outside of Inside Sales. Build your network, perform well, and find the influential leaders who help keep you sane in this role.

","No work life balance, especially if you have a global function
Significant cutting to positions with no back fill and no reduction in work the team is responsible for
Advice to Management
Don't tell employees they are expected to work 50 hours a week, when they're already working more than that. It's just shows you don't have a good pulse on your team.
Stop cutting to cut and foster growth and respect within your organizations.

2017-09-15, Inside Sales,"Plano, TX","Current Employee, more than 1 year",Inside sales,"Work life balance is great! Plenty of vacation time and holidays. Very young environment with friends you can connect with. Ability to move up quickly.
","Don't expect a commission check ever. The system they use is screwed up and when you try to fight for your commission check they will just keep making excuses. 

Even though you move up quickly they have been very stingy with offers when you are promoted. The might give you a few thousand dollars more and that is it. 

Management treats you like a child always. 

Metrics they use to track your performance don't truly reflect your performance. It actually encourages cheating and no one is honest. The honest people fall short when they have so much potential and should be recognized more.
Advice to Management
Stop ignoring the problems. There is so much turnover because nothing is getting fixed! We understand the commission is out of your control, but you have the power to atleast treat us like adults and stop ignoring the unhealthy and unethical work environment!

2017-09-06, Senior Program Manager,"Fort Collins, CO","Current Employee, more than 10 years",Not what it used to be...,"There are still pockets of the old ""HP Way"" to be found around the company.
","Not too long ago this company was very employee focused, developed great cutting edge products, and had a tremendous focus on high quality. The company is a shell of its former self at this point. None of the above stated things are true anymore. Almost every function in the company has been outsourced to some oversees supplier, no real R&D happens in the states anymore, quality has fallen off a cliff, there's constant WFR's, salaries go nowhere, medical/retirement benefits get reduced every year, and there's almost no hope for advancement for most front-line employees. All of this helps the executive level make huge financial gains for themselves at the expense of their lower level employees. I've been with this company for almost 20 years and am disgusted at what has transpired over that time.
Advice to Management
Focus on long term growth that will benefit everyone in the company as well as customers. Do not keep going down the path of short term gain at the cost of future growth. The current environment heavily favors the executive level while leaving most employees behind. Not to mention, product quality has been going down over the years due to an employee base that's getting incredibly demoralized.

Shame they got it wrong 5 years ago. Senior management do not understand the customers and continue to move deckchairs round the titanic.

2017-08-28,Anonymous,Wrocław,"Former Employee, more than 3 years",Good for a start but don't stay too long,"- Flexible working hours while adhering strictly to the Polish labour code.
- Work from home possible (depending on the manager).
- Many benefits which are basically standard on the local job market.
- Possibility to take lots of self-paced online trainings about various business topics.
","- Constant restructuring, mergers and splits on global level.
- Many global managers with no understanding of international markets (at least when I worked there).
- Managers can very easily block career advancement by not giving good enough yearly ratings (in order to not lose you on your current position) and therefore making you not eligible for certain trainings which would qualify you for higher positions within the company.
- Even though you get a yearly salary raise with average performance, you will be behind your peers in the local job market after 2 years. But there are worse employers in Wroclaw which don't give any salary raise.
- Salary is apparently below the local average.
- I hit the glass ceiling immediately after having been hired.
- I have heard from my ex-colleagues that the work climate has deterioated significantly shortly after I left.

","Since the separation the atmosphere within HPE changed. The constant cost cutting and re-structuring was unsettling to employees. Enforcing process and structures that are only suitable to a large business that have all appropriate resources in place. Unfortunately the Ireland business is a drop in the ocean in relation to the overall global organization and don't have the same level of resources or support but yet are expected to follow processes and procedures that are totally irrelevant to our local business. Let alone the time it takes to get approval to do anything.

","The compensation for individual contributors is embarrassingly low for a majority of the employees. Real compensation only happens to upper management. Anemic raises and bonuses are borderline insulting, even when performance has exceeded expectation year after year.
Advice to Management
Clearly state the bonus and compensation plan. 10% bonus plan, 15%, 20%, 30% etc all the way up to Meg. Total compensation is based up 3 metrics: individual performance, division performance and company performance. This should be the pattern from the lowest paid employee to the highest ranking employee. If any of the 3 are not met, the employee earns a percentage of the goal. To see executives's total compensation not tied to company performance is absolutely maddening and symptomatic of what's completely broken in corporate America today.

2017-08-10, Vice President,"Palo Alto, CA","Current Employee, more than 5 years",VP in Palo Alto,"Mostly well-meaning people with a good history of innovation. Many nice folks in engineering, sales, service and support organizations. More focused, nimble company than in the past. Solid margins on the business so generates good operating income. Lots of activity in M&A. Physical work environment is improving as some offices are getting good face-lifts. Budget seemingly always available for high-priced consulting firms - many of which work for HPE at any given time. World-class at planning and executing cost reduction/layoff plans. Always bringing in new external talent at very senior levels of the company. Good pay and benefits for executives. Good comp plans for sales professionals.
","HPE is in a difficult product market with flat to declining revenues, which leads to all kinds of issues, including but not limited to the following list: Very few opportunities as there is a focus on reducing executives. Annual planning cycle is composed of constant downward revisions to revenue plans followed by cost-cutting to maintain income as much as possible. Sr. Exec hires are NOT told ahead of time about the operational limitations that HR and Finance will place upon them, which leads to frustrations all around. Per financial statements, ""investments"" in layoffs are pretty comparable to investments in acquisitions - not a good place to be. Constant stream of sr. level executives that present ideas to Meg without sanity-checking ideas with the business leading to unreasonable expectation in the Executive Suite and frustrations in the rest of the organization. Not a good place for former big-3 management consultants. Very poor track record of attracting and retaining people from McKinsey, BCG etc.
Advice to Management
Determine whether the millions of dollars spent on consulting firms might not be better spent on retaining current management and perhaps hiring a few mid-level folks that will stick around. Institute 360 degree feedback for Directors & above (including SVPs and EVPs). Many poor leaders in Director and VP ranks in Palo Alto stick around for much longer than they should. Sucking up to EVPs/SVPs is not equal to thoughtful leadership and value creation.

- The company does not appreciate its employees even if you're loyal and great

- Cant forget the moment when HPE ditched the whole internal IT team to merge with CSC all of the sudden after IT related tasks completed for DMO activities. A lot of great people left the company since then.

Your employees are your #1 asset. They make, install, maintain and manage your products, and ultimately that is what your customers are buying. There are lots of companies out there that do the same thing - your differentiation used to be quality and comprehensiveness - now you are so busy focusing on price that what made you stand out is lost...and you are just another name in the crowd. Your internal processes are horrible - I've been fighting for over 6 months about my last paycheck, and it's still not resolved. Your payroll department still can't do basic math. I left the company voluntarily, got a 15% pay raise, cheaper benefits, better environment. Remember who got you where you are, and remember that without them you'll be nowhere.

Pros
Good benefits at the time, not sure after no longer being employed or as the company changed to DXC.
Cons
Came on as EDS employee working as a contractor at a customer. In the 8 years working there the threat of having my job sent overseas was always there. Never got a raise in those 8 years even after I was told I was doing a great job. Did get a 1-2% 'bonus' at the end of the year. Working at a customer site, HP managers would not even say hello in passing.

Good People, and employee benefits, when they get going on projects some good results that work well, Selling and delivery still seem to drift

No prospects or training, unclear if the Pointnext vision is going to work, shooting good business in foot. Despite saying otherwise forced ratings often get good folk down.

2017-07-23, Sales Representative,"Roseville, CA","Former Employee, more than 5 years",HPE used to be a good place to work,"This used to be a great place to work. However it has taken a few turns for the worse as the company has split from HP to HP Inc. and HPE. HPE has only continued to deteriorate as segments of the business have been out sourced or sold off. The only pro is that it looks great on a resume if you can stick it out that long.
","There is no reward for hard work here. You can hit your quota and work 12hr days on special projects, but there is no reward in the end. Positions are passed out to upper managements relatives and friends over a hard working individual. The Sales managers would refer to themselves as the ""boys club"". There is little diversity in the sales teams.
Change is constant and not for the best. Every year account assignments and roles change. Which makes for very unhappy customers and partners. Things are left undone and everyone is great at passing work along instead of taking ownership here to get things done. With it being a large corporation simple tasks such as getting a quote back can take weeks. 
Then you have the constant fear of being laid off. Lay offs are something you get used to and expect here. Once a quarter someone or a department is cut. I have seen dedicated individuals who have been there for over 20+ years get laid off with no explanation as well as early career hires that have been employed for less than a year. No one is safe. 
There is little direction and explanation on what the plan for the company is moving forward. Management is hardly around and most managers are able to work from home remote offices. Which means leadership and direction is scarce. 
I would highly recommend looking at other companies instead of this one. At least for now till they figure out that they are doing in the long run.

Many would leave and go to work for customers if they could Morale is very, very poor. Management has succeeded in destroying much of the team work and pride associated with HP EDS. But still a few good people remain.
","Very poor leadership. Lack of raises and bonuses despite promises. Having HP EDS on your resume no longer works for you, rather, so many ex senior employees out in the I T world, with such bad memories of the company, it actually works against you. The entire edifice is wrong, it has seriously lost its way. It has become all about signing sales contracts, even if the company cant deliver, just get the numbers and let the teams work it out. Make sure no contracts have any worthwhile penalties and the word guarantee never shows up. Lots of weasle words.
Advice to Management
If it is possible, tear it down and start again. Perhaps rehire some of the old time management and try to regain the enthusiasm and desire to do good I T work, not just focus on squeezing money and signing contracts. Many contracts are failing because the company lied to the client, both in terms of what they could deliver and the quality of the staff.

Cons
WFRs are ever-present anvil hanging over everyone's heads. The reasoning behind layoffs seems scattershot; when good people are let go, it kills morale. Employees are underpaid for their position, but are left feeling grateful that they at least still have a job.
Advice to Management
The company changes direction too frequently and too rapidly.

Several years ago, the company provided for teleworking - to the mutual benefit of the company. Offices were closed and consolidated. Now, they are attempting to move everyone back into an office - but those who now have no local office to report to are left with the choice of adding 3+ hours of commute time to their work day, or finding a new company to work for.

In my group, we were encouraged to provide training and guidance to newer engineers, in order to enhance ourselves for raises and promotions. Instead, WFRs began to whittle our group down, as the engineers we helped were promoted to take our places.

","Over the years, the company focus has been far and wide. They have been trying to hone there focus down to just the Enterprise Markets. This has entailed cut after cut with little fore thought of how to manage the employee pool. 

There has been little job security. Even great engineers are being let go.
Advice to Management
The ethics that the company demands of its employees, are NOT the same ethics shown to employees as they exit the company. Yes we have room to be a bit bitter. But you have room to improve and do the right things vs the minimum expected by state laws. You expect more than the minimum ethics from your employees. 

Bring back the HP Way... it is lost... The upper level management is no longer able to recite the rules of the garage. 

- Valuing the people 
- working together to overcome adversity

Are no longer expected.

Welcome to the Mark Hurd era part deux, sans the email scandal.
Here is my advice to management: Quit HPE before you do any more damage! Recently we canned many field people in the sales and support organization because of poor vision and poor marketing. So now we have fewer people to sell and somehow that will increase sales. Pure genius! I guess they figure that the channel will handle that. Good luck with that! The ONLY way that will happen is if you cash SPIFF the SA's.

","There are so many, I am not really sure where to begin....
HPE has recently made some major business decisions to sell off parts of the company that have greatly, negatively impacted their workforce, position in the industry, and customer base. These spinoffs of divisions have eroded and eradicated a clear strategy, vision, and value proposition to customers. While its competitors are growing, HPE is becoming smaller and less competitive. 
The sale of business units have led to massive company reorganizations that result in fast changing directives; and employees and customers being jerked around. The company is not generating revenue from new streams as much as it is cutting costs to increase company and stockholder value. This cost containment has left employees and customers on the short end of the stick with little to no resources; unclear objectives; no funds for travel to customer sites outside of immediate territory; marketing funds; inability to discount solutions to compete and win; and massive amounts of turnover. Positions are left open and not backfilled, leaving large gaps within account teams. Workforce Reductions are a way of life at HPE with at least one big round for WFRs per quarter. 
Management is mostly comprised of pompous men with an overwhelming sense of self-importance who are promoted to their level of ineptitude rather than experience. Managers are not concerned for their employees and will not stand up for them as management is more concerned about covering themselves. This culture has turned management into ""yes men"" who carry out Meg Whitman and her executive's plans regardless of whether it is good for HPE, its customers, or its employees. 
There is a lot of posturing, changing loyalties, and politics within management. Align yourself with the wrong person and you will soon find yourself out of a job. If you are a female of child bearing age who is starting a family or has children; or are a mature employee close to retirement age, you will be targeted for public embarrassment, constant putdowns and verbal abuse by your direct manager, and termination or WFR without reason. 
This company culture has led to a disengaged workforce made of either inexperienced new hires, or employees with a lazy, ""it is not my job"" attitude. Customers are beyond frustrated with the ever changing account teams, fragmented solutions, and constant change of HPE's state of business.
Advice to Management
Really take a look at who is leading this company and the role the Board desires HPE to play in the industry. Do these two things match up? In my opinion, they do not. 
In today's volatile Technology industry, treatment of women and mature employees in the workplace is under a spotlight. For a company led by a woman who preaches inclusion, the actions of HPE towards females and mature employees sure is suspect.

2017-07-13, Inside Sales Representative,"Plano, TX","Former Employee, more than 1 year",Inside Sales Representative,"Some of the best coworkers I have ever been around. They are talented, outgoing, and have a desperate desire to be led and coached.
","Upper Management treats you like school children. You get pop-quizzes, and they are always looking for ""gotcha"" moment. You can be a strong leader, top of the always changing leaderboard, but you walk down to the cafe to get a drink you will be asked condescending questions about how productive you are being. The Directors and Up do not have a desire to understand your book of business. They look at each account set as equal, but that is just not the truth. They have no personal skills to even greet you, yet the assume they know your daily struggles within your account set and will set the arbitrary leaderboard based off this. Zero desire to help you progress or improve your career. You are a warm body to them. Just a number. 

They are bogged down by slow processes. The VP verbally dresses down his Managers and threatens to fire them over insignificant things. It is a unnecessarily stressful job, that makes you constantly worried about your job security. This is a top down issue in the Inside Sales Organization. There is no voice of strong leadership.

The simple fact that we cannot get paid correctly is frustrating enough. But when Management sends an email about dress code, but cannot even give you a quick email saying ""Team your commission is top of mind, we will get this fixed"" it gives you a terrible feeling of where the priorities lie. Again, you are a warm body. They do not care about you, your career, or basic human interaction that lets you know they remotely care about you as an employee. 

It is a entry level job. Understand that. Use it to build your resume, but understand you will need to network outside of HPE in order to move up. There are few examples (2) of Reps moving up and out to field sales in my time there. In the last 3 months, 15 people have left HPE because of the lack of opportunity and investment.
Advice to Management
Exercise basic level of human interaction. Say hello. Say ""I appreciate how hard you are working, and I know you are covering for people who have left so I appreciate you going above and beyond"" 

Treat your employees like Adults. You might be a parent, but you are not our parent, or a babysitter. If you feel you need to babysit- hire better people. 

Find a mission, stick to the mission, and move forward. 

Reward good employees. Recognize them. Coach employees who need it.

Pros
Now a smaller company with less than 30,000 employees (down from 300,000 employees in 2014). They also don't let you visit customers without a minimum 3 week lead time/advanced approval and enforcing that all employees use Skype to meet with and to sell/design complex solutions to their customers. Also, no need to worry about cloud experience as everything they sell is all about hardware on-premise. Work is almost 100% remote which means you can stay home 99% of the time.
Cons
You may not have a job with all the downsizing taking place the rest of the year. Also, no real upside for exceeding quotas since they are set quotas extremely high for sales. It will be tough to compete with companies without travel restrictions. They also pay less than all their competitors but that is understandable since you will be working mostly from your Webcam at home.

","Top heavy and risk averse: seems like 95% of the hardware side of the company is mid-level executives, program managers, and 'architects'. 

Most of the low level hardware design has been outsourced. ""Engineering"" consists of managing third party contractors halfway across the world that actually do the work, and you can see the impact very clearly: there are a lot of reference design ""experts"" that lost their ability to actually engineer or analyze anything years ago.

Weird insular culture sometimes that is seemingly concentrated in Houston: many teams tend to be very protective of their work and not keen on collaborating with ""outsiders""

Any work that is not directly supporting a product is discouraged: there is little freedom or resource to innovate or develop new skills, and the outsourced business model makes this even worse.

","No GTM. Too many people doing the same job. Complete failure of a company. Its death by 1000 cuts. If you care about your career, stay away. Politics rules. Layoffs every 6 months. CEO is a bad joke. HPE its an example of Lions for Lambs. A joke of Technology company as Management is outdated in views, extremely political, and no customer focus. The best employees leave within 2 to 4 years. The name HPE in your resume, its not good.

STAY AWAY if you care about your career. Avoid the Salary OFFER pitch. Don't believe that what you are told the role is, will be what it is after 6 months. Its a sad joke of a company that the market will take care of in the long run.
Advice to Management

- for god's sake hire some managers who actually think and are good leaders!
- listen to your own employees, don't dismiss their opinions just because they don't have your visibility and/or experience, you might even learn something useful from them
- in business reviews with higher management show what works but also what doesn't and actually put some effort to fix those gaps, they are not going away if you ignore them - sometimes same issues persist for more than 5+years and WW/HQ just ignore them

","total disconnect between management and employees between announcements and succeeding actions. Once famous culture and management style has where everyone contributed at his best is substituted by extreme Taylorism, former cooperative and goal-oriented attitude is replaced by blaming someone else. Pure product oriented with two big bets: the machine and the intelligent edge. Bombastic announcement of Pointnext service organization turns out to be a simple combination of technology consulting and technology support. Cost savings and stupid processes overrule any innovative business idea. Management is helpless and cannot cope with market and customer demand, simply administering ruin. They even don't have a glue what's going on. No identification with the company at all. Can't believe that we will still exist in 3 years.

Focus on the employees. Figure out where to be adding resources, whether it be more compute nodes in labs, or updating employee laptops with solid state drives, etc. There is a lot of time wasted trying to bypass these issues, and it is hurting growth much more that the cost cutting is saving.

","No raises (unless you're your manager's favorite or you're a manager). Barely removed from the bottom of the barrel when it comes to receiving a bonus. 

The company has a culture of the ""good ole boy system"" which clearly gives favoritism to its members. If you're in, you're good, if you're not, be prepared to fight to receive something near the fair line or be prepared to leave. The employees (especially managers) portrayed themselves as if their race is superior to all others (within the company and to customers).

Benefits are decreasing, a lot. The company is trying to save itself from going under, so they're squeezing everything they can out of the employees to meet numbers for board members and investors.
Advice to Management
Stop trying to use up your best and most valuable employees without compensating them or providing a means to show how much you value them and their work. 

Stop wandering and trying to find yourself (re-brand)! Find better mid-level management and a new top executive to lead the company.

Get rid of the culture that illustrates that one race of US citizens is superior to all others.

- Despite spin-offs and splits with HPI/HPE/DXC/MF, company stays relatively the same as far as work goes.
-Work Life balance is pretty good being corporate, rarely need to work beyond 8 hours/day.
","-Layoffs everywhere due to bad management and unknown direction. They always talk about how great their products are and how the next step will be taken, but all I see is failure, uncertainty, and politics.
- Raises? No raises, rarely any bonuses. Almost 3 years has yielded about <3% raise, and <4% bonus, doesn't even keep up with COL.
-Mobility for younger employees is pretty tough. Every time a position opens up, whether laterally or to management, it is either filled externally or with a friend of the Director or colleague. Politics play way too much of a factor here.
- If you're in a department that doesn't generate money (aka anything but sales/marketing) it's tough to get any expenses approved and takes forever.

This means massive layoffs of skilled, seasoned workers in favor of hiring early career, offshoring jobs and H1B visas. The internal climate is currently very demoralized. Massive layoffs are currently occurring, and employees learn their colleagues have been laid off when they are no longer accessible in the system.

","Last three years had 1% raises. You do not get rewarded for long term employment. Promotions, raises, and bonuses are not granted because there is no budget to invest in existing employees, only to make hasty acquisitions that rarely work out, plus most acquirees figure out the long term career potential is nil and move on, leaving young'uns to be assigned to the new new thing while firing all the seasoned engineers that could have helped integrate the project into HPE, with greater insight and knowledge.
Advice to Management
Stop firing seasoned talent. Honor the HP way, respect employees for their potential. Go back to Bill and Dave's original model, where the business units wer. e autonomous and controlled their own destiny. Employess in acquired companies quickly realize they are only providing revenue to the company cash account for future acquisitions with no reward for the employees that made the business success for their formerly independent unit possible. Once their sales staff and development strategy is morphed into HPE, the product wallows and eventually is discarded in favor of something else.

Advice to Management
When acquiring promising companies, try to actually invest in them, rather than squeezing the talent out and trying to profit from the rinds. 

Not every product (very few, I imagine) can be outsourced to offshore organizations where the average offshored engineer's go-to move is not to actually think and solve, but rather to simply pass the buck back to the original (now much smaller) team. 

The result is that the original team succumbs to the weight of not only trying to support the product, but to also support the outsourced organization which, given how their own employees get moved around, contributes to the erosion of knowledge and experience, furthering the decline of the customer experience. 

TL;DR A paper tiger isn't a terribly useful support model.

","HPE is a hire & fire company so don't expect a long term career here. Upper management focus is on short term stock price only.

Many good people are jumping ship because of the frequent layoffs and uncertainty caused by management's pinball decision making.

Stop being reactive and focusing so much on short term profitability. Give the analysts a vision they can get excited about and make an effort to retain your people so you can execute that vision. The stock price will take care of itself when you're doing the right thing.

-Flexible schedules if you need to take care of a personal appointment.
","- Rotational opportunities are advertised but rarely ever given because we are constantly doing more with less people, however management will tell you, you are responsible for your own career

- You are not compensated for accomplishments, you are compensated largely for the number of years you have been working at HPE. In many cases, you have very low level employees doing high level work but are told they need more time and experience

- Consistently declining revenues are forcing management to cut any where they can

- There are no opportunities for travel unless you are a mid-level manager, 

- 401K contribution matching was decreased from first 4% of salary paid out quarterly, to 50% of first 3% of salary, paid out yearly at the end of year. You must be employed on 12/31 to get the matching. Of course, in recent years, major layoffs occur around Thanksgiving 

- Focusing heavily on the contractor model

-Recently an email was sent to employees asking for donations to lobby Washington to prevent import taxes from products manufactured in Mexico. Of course, the Trump election threw a curve-ball in their plans to off shore more jobs to Mexico. What was insidious however, was her ask from the employees she was going to lay off, for money to lobby Washington to send their jobs oversees

","Too much process. When the organization decided to switch from waterfall to agile, they used the agile tools and GitHub to gather statistics with which they rated engineers. I don't know which was worse: waterfall with no detailed statistics, or agile with too many numbers. IT processes were constantly a bottle-neck to development.

Starting in 2016 Meg Whitman started the ""Back to work at HPE"" program where work-from-home was no longer an option. Unfortunately, it seemed to be US-only. I saw no effects in other countries.

The constant split/spin-merge disrupted productivity. We had good engineers working on that rather than on products that would make the company money.

2017-05-16, Software Developer,Bangalore,"Current Employee, more than 5 years",Your mileage will vary,"Vast types of opportunities. Some of the lowest attrition rates in certain divisions. Most divisions have great work life balance.
","Some divisions have poor growth due to low attrition in upper grades. The Internal Job change procedure requires one to NOTIFY existing manager even before applying for an internal job. This is beyond ridiculous, especially when a large majority of positions are posted on the tool only for procedural purposes after filling the vacancy. 

As I said, your mileage will vary. Due to absence of uniform management oversight, some divisions are terrible to work for. 

Risk of future business downturns. They are in severely legacy businesses, all growth comes from inorganic acquisitions.
Advice to Management
Change the Internal Job change (IJP) procedure, you will immediately see the best talent move to the best divisions. Then you can take to task the divisions where most people are leaving.

The community-mindedness: I LOVE that HPE gives employees opportunities to volunteer, promotes volunteerism (with 6 days of paid leave per year for volunteering!), and allows employees to decide where foundation funds will be spent through Kiva.
","The culture: We are at a strange place in the evolution of HPE. With the tremendous changes over the past few years we seem to have lost our focus from an organizational culture.

Pros
I doubt if it has any pros left now -
1) The 'HP' way has long gone off. 
2) Now the situation is that even for getting your own reimbursements, you literally have to beg the finance team. 
3) HRs lie to you and don't stick to their promises
4) Everything depends on manager who are mostly bad here
5) Most of the actual performers have already left and now the company is full of oldies who just play dirty politics
Cons
I have already written cons in the pros section because there are no pros at all. The company policies are just to favor company only. No employee satisfaction at all, that is why HPE has highest iteration rate. From what I have heard is even Huawei is about to purchase the remaining HPE(what is left after migration with CSC). So even it do not have any positive future.
Advice to Management
Stop showing your ego in the name of company. You people have successfully ruined HP brand name and soon you will ruin what is left there too.

Start treating experienced, long tenured, loyal employees with more dignity.
After many years of service, many were, and will be spun off in mergers, and then laid-off within weeks of joining the new company. In the case of the DXC merger, 30 years with HP nets 8 weeks of severance. One of those 8 weeks includes your last week of work. This move was planned in advance to reduce the cost of the workforce and save HPE severance payments. It is unconscionable. If management is committed to treating its employees with a lack of transparency and respect, the same treatment of its customers can't be far behind.

","Profits are their top priority, employees are their lowest. Constant state of reorganization as if they can't ever get it right. Always spending to acquire new companies instead of increasing insurance coverage for employees. For a Fortune 50 corporation, their insurance is barely affordable.

HPE allowed their M&As to continue to operate like an autonomous, small company during their transition.
- Competitive salary and benefits
- On the job training and industry certification
- 90% of sales team are teleworkers
- Great leadership team
","My portion of the company will be spin-merged with Micro Focus this year and our Enterprise Services team have already spun off to CSC. Anticipate a lot of change and more lay-offs.
- Due to M&A activity, internal communication is scarce with many unanswered questions regarding strategy, operations, migration and future state.
- Numerous rounds of work force reduction has impacted overall morale and requires us to do more with less.
- Senior leadership entirely focused on earnings to satisfy mergers.

Handle the M&A delicately and communicate the impact to encourage the innovation and loyalty from existing team members and avoid losing top talent. I've witnessed what happens to products when key stakeholders leave the company.

2017-04-29, Business Analyst,,"Current Employee, less than 1 year",Lowsey Comp for years and now the benefits match it,"Better than being unemployed I guess
","I don't know if it's the merger or what but literally I can't pay my bills due to the Ins alone this year. I went from a $650?deductible with average benefits that was costing me about 7k/yr personally. To nothing but worst case scenario options this year. I don't say this out of ignorance either, having worked in healthcare for more than 40 years I feel I can state this with the knowledge required to make such an assessment. There were a few great options on our ""marketplace"" this year, but literally they cost (employee portion) more than I make (well I would be left with under 10k/yr not counting taxes) after paying my portion of my healthcare for those great plans. There's no major illness in my family (1 person is a diabetic which is controlled with medication and that person sees the dr MAYBE 3 times a yr). The other plans were all awful. This yr we have a $2,600 deduc/per person and it is costing just under 20k/yr (that's inclusive of the $5k I'm putting in my HRA-for those that don't know- this isn't the same as an FSA where all that money is put into you account on Jan 1, it's added to that account per check. So day 1 you will have access to $0 (until it clears their account after being paid, which takes a few days and in my situation that's approx $204ish twice a month). So if something major happens before the middle of the year you will probably be paying out of your own pocket your huge deduct as you won't have the money accumulated yet in your account). Not to mention the mail order scripts for my Aetna plan this year is OUTRAGIOUS. Typically we will get scripts that way because it's much cheaper. With our new plan it's literally (for a couple of scripts that a member of my family takes) 3 times MORE expensive then you typical Walgreens/CVS/RiteAid. Now I know some ppl will think that this type of situation is based o the ins comp, and while they would be correct, what isn't often understood is an employer can pick and choose and basically build different plan options for their employees (which will effect the cost of said Ins). What is typically used by patients (mail order pharmacy from their insurance carrier pharmacy carrier) isn't even an option for Aetna. Just google it and you will see whet I mean.
Advice to Management
Get rid of the ppl who care about only themselves and not the company (now DXC). Harvard and Princeton mean nothing if that person doesn't care about the longevity and success of the business but only how their personal account grows. Maybe that's why Meg isn't the CEO of the new merger, but even being on the board is bad. Meg became CEO of HP and did not perform, then CEO of HPE and again didn't perform (not to mention the general concensus by those employees under her agree she's terrible -this line of work Isn't eBay or Disney Meg, just don't allow her to take down DXC too.

2017-04-25,Anonymous,,"Current Employee, more than 10 years",Not what it used to be,"You can gain experience with a wide variety of customers, solutions and technologies. HPE is an innovative technology leader. Generally good compensation and benefits. Many creative and hard-working people.
","Cumbersome processes. Talk about employee support, training and mentoring, but little application or follow up. Greater focus on numbers than people. Lack of middle management engagement. Difficult and time-consuming systems and processes as a result of several mergers and spin-offs.
Advice to Management
Provide better support to valuable employees, including mentoring and training. Gain firsthand knowledge/experience on the systems and processes being mandated. Ensure separation of responsibilities (i.e. A customer or delivery PM should not have to spend significant time on Procurement, Payment, Legal and Finance activities). Enable access to the right people for vendor invoicing and payments (not just support tickets, which are prematurely closed).

- Friendly colleagues
","- Lack of proper management as most managers here tend to micro-manage

- Not much learning or training provided (only the online courses are available in which are not really detailed or particularly helpful)
- Increment of salary is rarely heard of
Advice to Management
Seriously improve the quality of your higher management. Access and train managers to actually be capable to 'manage'.
Also provide training or any learning courses as employees should be your biggest investment. Better employee = better results.

2017-04-21, Project Management,,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Graduate program is false advertised, no company culture","Big company name great for resume 
People with sound knowledge
Meeting some lovely people in work 

Great learning experience about the opposite end of a good and positive work place.
","Absolutely no work culture. The company does not treat employees and reward. Do not expect events, treats etc. They're all about keeping costs low, getting people productive constantly. Thus, treating employees as a number and people who need to be used frequently. 

People will get laid off frequently and be replaced with younger people as grads.

The graduate program is advertised with rotations and this does not happen at all. It is unstructured and you only find out through previous graduates you must network to find your own opportunity or anything available. The jobs are scarce. 

HR management is not up to standards like other big companies taking care of their employees concerns.

As a graduate you will do a lot of menial tasks which do not reflect what the job description is or what they tell you from day one.

There is barely any raises or bonuses. A lot of employees complain about their input and pay. It appears the organisation is not in its best time or simply greedy on wages. 

Being present for long hours is seen as very important. They want you to do typical hours and will not be happy if you want to manage your own time. If you finish your assigned work, you're expected to stay still and told to look busy. Do not expect a flexible career here.

Working from home is treated as a joke and hard to ask for. 

Some people will not share knowledge to you because they're concerned about their jobs.

Explaining suggestions to colleagues as a young person is not taken seriously. Expect the ""matured age"" effect.

Expect within teams there is competition and lack of trust.

Leaders and managers lack EQ. Expect rudeness and only concerns of deliverables.

Leaders and managers are not concerned about your passions and what gets you motivated.

","- Career progression was and continues to be limited due to all of the changes HP has been experiencing (the split to form HPE, merger with CSC and formation of DXC); 
- Workplace morale is very low due to the constant changes and the number of workforce reductions occurring; 
- Salary is dependent upon where you came from so no consistency
- Raises and recognition are virtually non-existent for the majority of employees; 
- As WFRs continue to occur, the workload of those let go is just pushed to those who remain and already over-burdened; 
- WFR's are part of every day life and expected as the company continually attempts to re-structure and reduce expenses to keep shareholders happy; 
- Allegiance is to the shareholders
Advice to Management
It is the people of a company who make the company, and in turn their customers, successful; HPE lost sight of the people many years ago and 'some' focus needs to return to the employee. Saying you care is not the same as showing. Employees will rally with you when they feel appreciated. I believe very few believe that to be true today. The people who remain don't feel safe, they are just waiting their turn, for the next wave of WFRs that they know are imminent. I wish the former CSC and HPE employees who remain, success as they embark as DXC but if the company culture does not change, it will be a lose-lose for everyone unfortunately

","HPE is a great environment for early employment individuals. Senior professionals should look elsewhere. The company does not promote individual thoughts, vision or innovation in the sales organization. The senior leadership seems to want robots to carry out orders without question or individual thought processes. Team is an excellent concept until you limit individual input and ideas. Furthermore, the leadership is making decisions in a vacuum that affect customers, partners and employees negatively without any input. The latest of many reorgs was a huge mistake and HPE will feel the carnage of those decisions for years to come. Most of the partners are looking on an exit strategy because HPE has not been consistent with direction or deliverables.

Cons Overweigh Pros. Start paying for atleast the job done by employees like overtime pay. Bad HR policies are the main reason for high attrition in HPE.

Co workers are friendly and helpful. You are provided a work station just for you to use.
","Almost none but a few top positions where one can climb the ladder and improve their salary. Lots of turnover. Leaders are more defined as managers who are not very proactive in assisting the team for the better cause. Management will talk down to often and whenever there is appreciative words its hard to decipher if they are actually meant. No raise in years, bonus at end of year for review is hit or miss. Health care cost increases are passed onto employees. Benefits coverage have gotten worse over the years. Selective rules/treatment for co workers. Not to sound nit picky but to be noted-the building besides the Lobby/bathrooms are very dirty and rundown appearing on the inside.

You almost don't have to work overtime at all if you don't want to - that probably makes up for the low salaries. For fresh college graduates, HPE also has a good policy converting interns to full-time employees if they do well. 401K matching and holiday leave (15 days for up to 5 years of employment) is reasonable.
","HP used to be a leading company attracting top talent, but not anymore. Salaries do not match other companies looking for the same candidates, and there are few interesting projects, so the company isn't able to attract good people. Mediocre people leads to canceled or delayed projects and not being able to keep up with the competition. Leadership is also poor - company politics is rife with those talking loudest getting the most credit, rather than people who really do the wok.

2017-04-10, Computer Programmer,,"Former Employee, more than 10 years",Good place to work for some folks (including me),"HPE engineering treats people with respect and offers opportunities to work on cutting edge technologies. The benefits are in line with the rest of the industry, and there is a reasonable amount of flexibility in working arrangements (work at home some days, no strict working hours).
","HPE is unfortunately in a business (hardware infrastructure) that is rapidly being replaced by cloud providers (AWS, Azure) who build their own hardware and data center management software. It's going to be a serious challenge to overcome these trends in the long run.
Advice to Management
Stop buying companies for a high price and either running them into the ground or selling them for much less than you paid. Run the company you have rather than trying to acquire companies you don't. I can't think of a single acquisition that worked out well (Palm, 3Com, Tipping point, etc.)

While you can mostly control the first objective, the second is often completely out of your control, and a screw up by someone elsewhere in the account may lead to the dreaded early morning meeting request from HR.

The discordant way HPE announced the upcoming laying off of hundreds of good hard working employees was insulting. Employees had to learn about it in the newspapers. A much better way would have been to summon the employees and announce the bad news in a honorable way,
This might be the only thing hundreds of employees will remember after years of enjoyable dedicated employment.

","The management cannot keep up with the ever changing directions of the offerings or how they are going to execute them. Laying off experienced older employees and losing core talent and experience at an alarming rate. The product offerings are suffering due to all the upheaval and direction changes. Emphasis is placed on speed to market and not as much as value to market. More recalls and problems with products.
Advice to Management
Streamline and define product selection and cut down diversifying into too many areas of product offerings. Value and reliability in a set core offering would help stabilize the companies on both sides. More uniform processes and go to market values need to be brought back to the core of the company process. In my opinion it is better to offer a select number of excellent products as opposed to offering an over abundance of mediocre ones. The value gets lost in the chaos.

Please do something to bring the healthcare insruance cost down. Paying 1500 a month for family of 4 and then having to pay over 3500 out of pocket expenses is pretty high. Negotiate a better deal.

2017-03-21,Anonymous,,Former Employee,"Great company to work for, but with a few big company problems","I loved working with smart, talented people dedicated to building awesome products and services. Good work/life balance.
","Management tended to listen to development over test. Also the development team that we worked with would repeatedly over promise and under deliver. The first few times this happened, I thought that these were just growing pains of switching to Agile. But as time went on, all of our concerns brought forward by our group about unrealistic expectations created by the development org were actively not listened to.
Advice to Management
Listen to your test organization, and failing that, if a group repeatedly demonstrates that they can over promise and under deliver, you should expect that next time they will do exactly that. So stop letting them set themselves up for failure.

Pros
None. Seriously - I cannot think of one advantage (ignoring the folks I worked with - who have since all left). You can't travel to meet clients, there are no team events (because that would involve travel) no training and no work.
Cons
Almost too many to list. The worst work 'culture' I have ever seen. Senior execs are only interested in their bonuses. Meg Whitman is just intent on selling off parts of the company to whoever will give her the cash - to the point where there is no value left. And ok they're 'merging' HPE ES with CSC - and
Keeping *neither* brand. That speaks volumes. 

I read a review before I joined that referred to management as 'awful, awful people'. At the time I ignored that comment - I wish I'd heeded it. 

This company (and DXC) is circling the plug hole. They are relying on their company reputation from 20 years ago. Do yourself a favour and just look elsewhere.

2017-03-16,Anonymous,,"Current Employee, more than 10 years",The company is a sad shell of what it once was.,"The people I work with directly are talented dedicated professionals. There is plenty of access to free web training available (but it is on your own time). There is plenty of opportunity to learn and grow your skillset via on the job training and working with talented people.
","I saw more WFRs than I can stand and I'm glad to be leaving. The jobs of good talented workers, even those that are top performance ranked, are flowing to India quarter over quarter throughout the organization. I'd encourage you to Google it; Meg announced the company would be increasing offshored workers to 60+% over a year ago. I wish I could say this is because there is a talent pool that US workers can't compete with but the truth is that, in my experience, they are just cheaper and lack the appropriate skillset that was present in the folks they just laid off. In the end, your skillset doesn't matter and your dedication and performance doesn't matter. Middle management will keep playing shell games and reorganizing quarterly so they are not held responsible for their bad decisions. Promotions/rewards are for the friends of management chain, regardless of appropriateness of skillset and performance, so don't chase carrots you are never going to get. My advise, in particular for new college hires, is to go elsewhere! The corporate values and culture exist on paper only. Over time, benefits have become more and more costly and coverage has declined to the point that most companies can provide the same. As for raises, expect around 3%, if any; generally less than the cost of living is increasing; yes, even when corporate profit targets are met.
Advice to Management
Focus on quality and the profits will come. Realize that your well trained employees are going to work for your competition and your customers will see all your dirty laundry in the poor quality of your products, then act accordingly. It won't take long for bad decisions to damage the brand and it will be far more expensive in the long run.

Advice to Management
Take some responsibility for your failures. How can you be so ""excited"" about everything that you announce when all you have achieved is to have broken this once amazing company.
Hand over your responsibilities to someone who can make the necessary changes (and I don't mean constant rounds of debilitating redundancies alone). Talk about ""one trick ponies"".
Instead of going from 8 layers of management to 6 why not be a little more savage here...say 4 (or less). How much cost do these clowns generate? Your inertia as far as generating new sales and assisting delivery is astounding. You are mighty fine at workforce management because that's been your only area of focus really.
Your processes suck. What happened to agile/nimble? Jargon Busters? Simply more cost down the drain.
Why can't you trust your managers. No-one can make a financial decision without going to European regional heads of sheds for approvals. You have a pathetic lack of trust in good people.
Have a look at how you might manage to build morale because it seems to me that the company is on a death spiral and the merger will aggravate it further. Your people are broken. Almost everyone I know is looking to escape and their inertia is the only thing keeping them with HPE. Not sure how you will alter that...
Good luck. You absolutely need it.

Recommend
CEO Approval
Business Outlook
Pros
Good starting salary for fresh grad, high night differential pay, not strict in time-in. Can swap shift with teammates if needed, can work from home if needed
Cons
Workload is not proportional to the salary. Don't ever work in a support environment, especially if it is a 24 by 7 support team. You'll lose your life. no career growth. More and more customer demands added to your workload but no salary increase! No overtime pay as well. 

And the annual increase gets delayed for 6months??! Wth. That's half a year! What kind of management is that? You only get a bonus of around your food allowance for half a month. Not beneficial. No xmas gifts, no freebies for employees. Salary and night differential pay is the only thing that can keep you going here 

And what happened to your certification programs?? What i get from employment is just a couple of training. While those other people who has very light workload, they have already been certified, when in fact you were the one who needs it the most. Cost cutting at its finest.
NO WORK LIFE BALANCE -leaves are hardly approved even if it is filed within the lead time.
You cannot go to company events or activities because you cannot leave your work!
FOR APPLICANTS, DO NOT APPLY IN A 24 BY 7 SUPPORT TEAM IN HP. please check first the workload and what you will be doing before you say yes to the offer.
Advice to Management
Your managers should be sensitive to the needs of their people. You cannot just throw more and more work but no perks or additional pay coming! Also, you cannot just delay the increase and expect people to just say yes! Please check why attrition is high at a certain team. Some teams in HP even do nothing yet they get paid the same.with the team who almost do everything! You must do something to compensate your employees if the customer cannot finance addition workforce, otherwise you'll just lose people one by one.

You need to stand up from others a lot if you want to see changes in your payslip, but it doesn't necessarily mean that you will grow automatically although you do it. However, that compensates with the flexibility you have, for example, working from home possibilities, and other benefits that don't have to do with money.

2. They have good ethical training
","1. Team Leads are non-technical. They know 0% of whats in code. LOE are done senior technical.
2. No moderate bonuses. More than 95% will get 0.7% bonus i.e. few hundred dollars. Only those who have very good repo with clients will get moderate bonus of 2-3k.
3. The environment is not the one that gives challenges to employees. They would reserve it to few, for e.g. architects.
4. Freedom of thought: The management would most likely kill your idea, even before it starts.
5. Transperancy: There is little information provided by management of whats going on.
6. Training/Cost re-imbursement: They would have contract worth millions. But, wont re-imburse even $150 on attained certificate, which is relevant to the job. So that, you dont have motivation to grow.
7. Career Oppurtunities are non-existent. If you are developer, you will retire as a developer. Period. There is absolutely 0% promotion in technical fields
Advice to Management
More technical people with Project Management certificates should be given chance rather than non-technical ones. You have boat load of them, good for nothing.

","Major culture shock from EDS to HP, then Gradual culture change decline on employee care over the 8 years and more focus on milking employees to passively force employees to move on. Also change in practice from coaching employees on corrective paths or making the tough call to let them go, and more passing poor performances from manager to manager.
Advice to Management
Evaluate annual Mission statements and then review whats happening on the ground level. there are some low-midlevel managers who are mucking up the gears and our customers are seeing this and we are loosing good people who would gladly take pay cuts if it is about the figures, I;m not one of them. but I know we have talent still with the company and talent that has been lost to competitors due to lay WFR and it is a shame.

2017-02-22, Senior Presales Engineer,"Bracknell, England, England","Current Employee, more than 5 years",Good but declining,"HPE has historically been a great place to work with a pleasant working environment, positive attitude and good benefits.
Co-workers are almost universally friendly and cooperative.
In the software division, there has been some recent good innovation.
","The forthcoming divestiture of the entire HPE software division (called a ""reverse spin"" by mgmt) to Micro Focus (expected to complete in Aug 2017) clearly shows that HPE is not committed to the business.
There have been extensive reassurances that things will remain mostly unchanged at Micro Focus, but this has not been borne out by the large-scale redundancies in the field sales, development, support and marketing teams globally in Q4 2016/Q1 2017.
Much of the sales activity is being migrated to new online/inside teams offshore in Dallas and Barcelona. Micro Focus clearly did not want to absorb such a large, complex organisation and the move to online is part of the transition.
It isn't clear what the future will hold, but the concept of selling large value enterprise software solutions mostly via remote/inside teams is flawed, and there is no clear commitment to a strategic platform to deliver value to customers.
Advice to Management
Customers need a clear enterprise strategy for software. Simply retaining software product lines for support revenue, and having several competitive solutions (the Mercury versus Compuware/Borland tools for example) will lead to confusion. There needs to be a full commitment by management to staff without the constant fear of ongoing redundancies.

Management double speak. Many executives/senior management have bad work practices. Policies can be circumnavigated..much like what numbers do you want to see. people will be asked to make it happen - creative with numbers to suit governance forums. 
Weak governance - in the name of chasing sales. 
Sales people are king. Often times they commit to client deliverables without adequate support from delivery team
Advice to Management
Executive and senior management to walk the talk - are the execs really serious with the trouble projects and roll up your sleeves to take actions.. not just give orders and walk away ??
Get serious with deliveries, not just sales chasing sales figures then collect their bonuses and let delivery teams sort out the trouble projects
Stick to proper governance, have the courage and maturity to knock back deals if the fundamentals don't look right.

","The C-suite does not know what they're doing. Redundancies are called ""workforce management program"" - which tells you what they think of the employees. Generally bad, outdated HR practices (performance reviews forcing people on the bell curve and the like). Don't know which is more prevalent: internal bureaucracy or internal marketing telling you how great the company is (yeah, sure...), direct managers have no power to manage - the big, faceless corpo keeps their hands tied. No career progression, no pay rises, yearly bonus (if you're lucky to get one) is only enough for 1 night out, lack of support.

I would suggest Meg Whitman go undercover to see and hear the many complaints of her employees especially the hourly workers! Care more about your employees and they will work better for you! It's ashame in this billion dollar company many of the hourly workers are getting government assistance to get by!!!!

2017-02-15, Senior Software Engineer,Sydney,"Current Employee, more than 10 years",Software Support,"HPE does many things well. And you can learn a lot from working for a large organization. And there are resources to assist in learning.
","1. Lay-offs are continuous and without cause, yet wide enough and just under the legal limit to not have to state them, per SEC and labor regulations.
2. The work-life balance is to balance your life to work more.
3. First line management is remote, and therefore little visibility into the real work, outside of status reports and the occasional phone discussion.
4. Mid management and upper management are hired, mostly, from outside of the company. These are managers, not leaders, that bring in their own ideas, that may or may not fit HPe, it just being a random-shot.
5. Pay is stagnant. Bonus's are a joke. They would be better to just have an additional three day weekend instead of the insult of the bonus or lack of bonus or no-pay raise after working your butt off and making solid contributions to the company's bottom line.
6. The company needs to start to grow again organically, instead of managing the financial statements to appear to have the company grow.

Company culture switches with each CEO. Current CEO wants all employees in an office, although the majority are contract workers to whom that rule does not apply. It is a way to say ""all employees are co-located"" athough the majority of workers are contractors. It's a silly rule since sitting in an office with people that are not on your projects really doesn't help the culture. Through all the lay offs there is never any compassion from upper management acknowledging that it must be hard to continue working with many of your coworkers gone but only get ""keep focused."" There must be some management guidelines that say to never empathize on this matter. It is crystal clear that the stakeholder is priority and employees are expendable.

2017-02-05, Professional Services Manager,"London, England, England",Former Employee,Truly Awful UK Management,"It was possible to keep workload to a minimum while working on outside courses, working on CV and looking for other positions outside the company. I had a lazy boss so when it came to travel, his secretary approved the expenses and as we got along, my expenses were always approved. However, my boss abused them so he really couldn't say much. But it did enable me to travel and have a very good standard of living.
","If you pay as little as possible, people will do as little as possible. This was very common in the UK. A lot of resentment toward the management. Bullying is not leadership. A lot of work is contracted to India, but this never works well. We had many contracts that we won solely on price based on low cost contracting out, and these savings were never made. We relied on changes, restricting quality control, training, documentation etc. to make up any shortfall. Don't understand why any respectable company would do business with EDS HP.
Advice to Management
It is the culture to charge as much as possible for as little as possible, to exclude any financial guarantees in contracts, to always promise employees they will be looked after Tomorrow, when tomorrow never comes etc. Just a Shyster company and no advice would be taken.

For the most part, most people at HP are just a number to the leadership, i.e. employee # 214,755 out of 350k+ employees. A strong tendency from upper management to prefer sugar coating and avoidance of problems vs candid truth and fixing obvious (and fixable) problems head on. If you are not a sugar coater and can't tolerate idiotic process then definitely stay far away from HP ESS.
Advice to Management
Flatten the hierarchy, stop just giving lip service to the large scale problems and actually do something to fix them. Remember that HP was once a very highly respected company with an excellent reputation and that you should be embarrassed to have let that reputation die. Get back to core competencies.

Laying off such large numbers of people and overworking those few who remain is a recipe for disaster in a service business. Bill and Dave (the company founders) would be ashamed of how the corporation treats its staff now.

If you like a place where customers have no idea what the company does, with no idea of what they are or where they're going or what they are proud of -- then this for you - enjoy
","Lost its way - no people care - HP Way is gone - no strategy other than satisfying executive bonuses and investor returns - purely an M&A organisation run by external investment advisors - employees face redundancy every quarter for last 10 years leading to stressed out people with low morale. Many with no increased wage for over 8 years. Advanced training has been almost zero for years. Not a place to start your career, promotion easier if you join from an external company, internal promotion very limited.
Advice to Management
You need a massive step change - new remit, structure and values. Rapidly becoming a commodity company in a flooded market, with decreasing contracts and out of touch dinosaurs looking forward to their cut of the M&A booty at the expense of hard working employees - take a look at yourselves, you're out of touch with reality - there is a massive communication gap between good managers and those tasked with corporate management.

Work with world class companies and partners

Good health benefits in terms of low deductibles and an FSA

Some really great upper management here and there 

Work with people that have years upon years of industry experience
","Low morale due to seemingly endless layoffs, bad training, bad leadership - either have only worked for HP(E) so they lack in insight on how to manage and due to poor training and endless shifts in direction have no clue how to properly manage OR they have been so beaten down by working here they just don't care anymore. 

A company who's trainers preach ""be open to change"" and answer a question with a tag line ""well the HPE answer is 'it depends' "" is a HUGE red flag. 

No one knows the direction of the company due to its never ending changes. You can feel them and see them yet no one can tell you why and executive management preaches the strategy has not changed. 

Upper level management will tell you a direction to go in and what they want and you will get an email or be called into a meeting later with your direct manager and they will proceed to tell you something different. How confusing. 

Increased benefit cost because company is paying less. 

Reduced 401k match. 

Very hard to get promoted so don't expect a change in salary or to make a long term prosperous career here anymore.

Cuts in workforce have slowed down our already slow quoting and procurement time.
Advice to Management
Talking about how great things are for stockholders is one thing but you're forgetting why you can even make that statement in the first place - you have a company that's able to do things that is great for your stockholders because of all of the people that work for you. Your people are scared and morale is low. Your people are afraid to move positions because no one knows if that department is safe from the next round of spinoffs or WFRs. Your people are confused as higher ups continue to leave the company and we are wondering what do they know that we don't. Your people make HPE tick. Don't forget about us.

","Get on the wrong project and your prospects for career advancement are gone for the foreseeable future.
Some managers try very hard to establish a sense of community, but it's difficult when 90% of your interface with colleagues is email or phone.
Not allowed to telework--which makes no sense when the vast majority of your team members are scattered all over the world. Bad call, Meg.
Some good people, but turf battles are frequent and nasty and it's easy to get caught in the middle.
Trying to cut travel costs. Hard to establish relationships with customers when you're not allowed to visit them.

Great place for young people seeking career opportunities. Lot's of teamwork & energy. First level of management is generally supportive of their people and allow them to think outside of the box whenever possible.
Cons
Terrible practice of forcing long-time employees back to the office after years of successful teleworking, even when there's no advantage to them being onsite. Might work for well new hires, but not seasoned employees (most of us paid our dues when WE were new hires).

The layoffs are alarming, with most of the lost jobs being offshored. It's so widespread and frequent that no one even flinches anymore, except the ones being shown the door.

Today, it's a corporate dinosaur, shedding employees faster than you can imagine. Nearly all technical positions have been offshored, middle management positions have been gutted to the bone marrow and the threat of Workforce Reductions in the United States is in the back of the mind of each and every employee unless you're in the upper tier of management. 

HP isn't alone in this, most large IT firms in the United States have most of their staff in India or other low-cost areas. If you're good, do yourself a favor and find an internet-focused startup where you'll have a future and more importantly, steady employment. You won't find it at HPE.
","Everything I wrote above, as I can't find anything positive unless you're looking for an office or sales position where your smile and appearance or voice are your assets, rather than IT technical knowledge.

Worked with some of the brightest in the industry. Learned hardware, operating system, and application side. Full time remote work at the time was allowed. Unfortunately, that is no longer an option.
Cons
Terrible pay and benefits. Most of my peers did not receive any raises year over year. Asked to work extended hours and on call. Annual workforce reductions in the excess of 10k+ employees per year. Hiring strategy is to interview and offer jobs to college students two months before other companies start interviewing, make an offer early, and only give a few days before the offer expires.
Advice to Management
Stop getting rid of older engineers and talent and replacing with college hires. It makes the good older engineers either paranoid about their job or they leave on their own. The younger crowd views the job as a job and plans to leave after a year or two.

-the co-workers were great, very professional and well-educated - could really learn a lot from them
-working from home was possible up to 3 days a week - of course that would have to be worked out with your boss
-the environment wasn't overly stressful - even when the projects got heated people were still able to keep their cool and enjoy a healthy work-life balance - nobody was forced against their will to work overtime (instead people that wanted the overtime pay volunteered to do the overtime duties when necessary)
","-corporate environment (naturally) - boring mandatory training sessions, etc
-projects could have been managed in a better manner - this was likely a side-effect of the IT consulting market however

Motivation without the right compensation is not the best strategy to improve results and people commitment at the same time.

","Very old fashion strategy, practically very poor one with a lot of make up rather actual change, poor greeedy senior executives all being one clique from the ex-EDS time that in the past collapsed EDS now they collapse ES. This reflects to multi-years promises for change with zero improvement, holding of on salary changes for years even in their strategic growth locations, example 2013 was with zero budget for any salaries, 2014-2015 were with 0.5% average which lead some employees to get 1-2% increment after 1-2 years waiting promotion increase (equal to $100 annual gross increment). Lot's of lies and corporate 'hot air' just to make money from stock price for a few top executives and the board of directors. The employee mass is super disappointed and the average annual attrition for the last years since 2013 is 15% across all growth locations.
Advice to Management
Useless CEO Meg Whitman unable to cope with such large corporation and specific business, politically surrounded by his connection with the US Republicans and focused only on the promises makeup keeping stocks up until all get spin off. Keeping around her C-Level focused on their retirement plans (names cannot quote because Glassdoor rules don't allow but literally all) afraid of really shaking the corporation. - Change all or sell all... this is the future of this corporation after 75 years growth and development of their founders. I feel sorry for them, good that they are dead.

CEO Approval
Business Outlook
Pros
Most of the ""Technical"" people within the company (at least at my Alpharetta Location) are eager to learn and discuss technology so making friends and discussing actual technical items is a positive aspect of this job.
Cons
wow, many cons...
1. Training is awful then they throw you into the fire and only desire warm bodies to answer phones. 
2. There is no growth plan for many of the positions and while they point to WBTs/CBTs (web/computer based trainings) senior people who actually know the product are very reluctant to part with information due to the WFRs (work force reductions) as they expect you will take their job.
3. Salary is now (2016 figures) about 22-35% lower than many regional jobs and probably lower still for national figures. 
4. Constant layoffs - daily in fear of losing your job. Only hear feedback when you screw up which happens a lot since the lack of training, etc. In the old days this would be referred to as ""20 goto 10"". My understanding is they are still offshoring until 2018 at least even though they brag about U.S. based jobs and are constantly hiring, but there is no ""backfill"" as this is actual attrition and turnover.

2017-01-07, Web App Security Tester ,"Manila, Manila, Manila","Current Employee, more than 1 year",HPE Fortify on Demand - Web App Security Tester,"The real definition of work-life balance.
Flexibility to do work from home during holidays or weekends.
Lot of opportunities to showcase talent and be given the essential growth needed.
Good opportunity for fresh graduates or career shifters to start and become adepth with IT Security. 
Standard procedures and IT process have already been established and higly documented.
Employee can easily move up for a management role if given a chance without much process needed.
Nice compensation package for those beginning in their IT career.
","Lacking essential trainings and seminars to those who need them the most. Certifications are also lacking.
Roles are too narrowed down. There's a high chance for the person not to be exposed in the true scope of IT security. Not good for those who want to accelerate their potentials. 
Constant change and reorganizations have impacted the overall progress of the organization.
Management is a hit and miss. At one point, you could be at one of the best employers in the world and the next thing you know, the organization is falling apart. 
Too much politics going around (lately) which could lead to the dismantling and downfall of the team.
Bonus and increase is too low for the success and efforts made by the organization.
Broken promises for plans with the individual employee and the organization.
Advice to Management
Take care of the employees who are really putting an effort. Do lot let people who built the team from the ground up leave just because a manager think they underperform when in fact they have established and built a strong team. Listen and learn from your employees.

Some employees can work from home. Culture can be great depending on your team/leadership. Base compensation is almost competitive with market rate.
Cons
Medical benefits have recently been diminished, bonuses and raises are weak (if existent). Retention and investment in employees is laughable. Many leave the company and come back later in order to get raises or promotions. Constant change and constant workforce reductions.
Advice to Management
Invest in your employees instead of constantly firing them. If anybody needs to get fired, start with those making the most money and doing the least actual work.

Education opportunities for career growth
Great on-site gym at Moffett Towers
Nice peers lower in the food chain
","HPE's software conglomerate model didn't work. The strategy to acquire diverse and independent software assets created a big structure with little in common. The more layers of management that got added, the more insulated the decision makers became from the businesses that drive the revenue and their customers. Add a consolidated, bureaucratic, antiquated sales and fulfillment infrastructure, too many SKUs in the sales quiver and no sales specialization, and you've got declining revenues and declining market relevance across the board, leading to decreased investment in R&D and overall attrition and decline. Appearances of the spin-merge with Micro Focus so far make it appear that the strategy going forward will be largely unchanged.
Advice to Management
Re-diversify the software assets and re-specialize them in their respective markets. Hire leaders who understand the industry the individual software businesses cater to so they can set business goals that are relevant in their given industry. Hire better, more inspiring leaders who can move the needle and generate real growth instead of filling out payroll rosters in low-cost regions just to save money from an ever-declining revenue pool.

2017-01-01, Marketing Communications Manager,"Houston, TX","Current Employee, more than 1 year",Slave pit.,"Good experience if you work yourself to death, and learn to be political and expect nothing. Used to be flexible work schedule but most work from home ability has been taken away.

2016-12-31, Software Tester,Bangalore,"Current Employee, less than 1 year",My 2 month experience,"HPE has a few good things like the work culture like the environment where you work ,and the timings when you work and how you dress upto work
","Although most seen and heard about Hpe work culture ,you must understand that its not the work in hp that is good but the way you come in to work,so these are totally different things
why i say this is not because I have a personal grudge on hpe ,but because you never get to choose your work,which is a very sad thing since 80% of the people in hp are not satisfied because they are working against their nature ( meaning a programmer here becomes a tester and vice versa),or else no matter what you do you will not find profits
Advice to Management
A sincere advice to the management,please ask the hire about their line of interest,or else you will be working with people who just wait for the end of the month for their pay

Business Outlook
Pros
Flexible schedule. Good benefits. Flexible work at home options. Opportunity for learning new technologies. Great employee participation with community outreach.
Cons
Expected to know new technology without training or mentor. poor/no communication between sales team and implementation teams. Products sold to client are never products the implementation team eventually configures.

2016-12-29, Software Developer,"Fort Collins, CO","Former Employee, more than 3 years","Great team, OK company","I was on a fantastic team. My coworkers were wonderful and my manager was the best I've ever had. We built a great product that was the first in its category and was successful in the marketplace.
Overall, the company has a culture of innovation that is unlike anything I've seen anywhere.
","There is no vacation carryover to the next year. Though everyone gets at least 3 weeks vacation time, 4-6 days must be used for an annual shutdown (Christmas to New Year in USA, other major holidays in other nations).
The pace was exhausting. It seemed like we were always in crunch mode. Our managers were good about reducing scope after workforce reductions cut our team in half.
Advice to Management
Follow through on promises. Stating that a particular site is a center of excellence for networking and then dismissing the entire networking R&D team from that site a month later doesn't promote trust.
