","Extremely toxic culture in assembly and test factories.

Multiple 'clans' in the company. So called 'team work' is ganging up with your clan to outdo other clans with underhanded tactics; backstabbing, making other team members look bad, passing the buck and taking credits of others' successes.
Employees with support from senior management repeatedly bully and create hostile work environment without any consequences. 

Management in assembly and test do not walk the talk, extremely hierarchical and ignore workplace bullying. Some middle management use insulting words and yell at their employees, firefight, micro-manage, lack problem solving skills and dodge difficult questions in meetings by giggling away. 

Some key manufacturing KPI are constantly being 'altered' to appear good in reporting. Ever wonder why it's a GREAT PLACE TO WORK company but the turn over rate is high?

If given the choice, go for opportunities in frontend fab where team work is prevalent, management is friendly and cares for their employees.

Advice to Management
Too many things are dictated from the highest level. Lower level managers care about their employees at least as much as upper management, you should trust them to make decisions for their organizations.

2021-08-25, Senior Engineer,,"Current Employee, more than 8 years",High attrition rate and no work-life balance,"Decent starting benefits (but that won't scale with experience and tenure) and a very diverse workforce
","Micron works their engineers into the ground. They implemented a rank and fire performance system three years ago which has sent morale straight into the toilet by creating a culture of mistrust and anger among their engineering teams. Each year more and more of Micron's top talent gets driven out of the company by the awful performance system paired with the lack of employee raises. 
The attrition rate is so high that several engineering teams are on the verge of collapse. Senior leaders can recognize the problem but their hands are tied by the executive leadership's unwillingness to hire more people or provide meaningful raises and bonuses to their most experienced and productive employees. 

 Micron's executives have gutted their engineering teams and have zero talent retention - you can get paid more and maintain a better work-life balance at any other company in this industry. Instead of addressing these issues Micron has decided to offshore more engineering work and now expects their US employees to work all day, meeting with their counterparts in India early in the morning and counterparts in Singapore late at night. Sometimes these problems get acknowledged in all hands meetings, but at the end of the day nothing gets done because leadership has structured the company in a way that requires engineers to expect 7AM meetings followed up with 9PM meetings several days each week.

Micron's leadership takes very real social issues such as diversity and inclusion and weaponizes them as subjects they can fill all-hands meetings with to pretend they're a good corporate citizen - because if they carry around a list of talking points about how racially diverse the company is with male-female pay equality they can sidestep questions about how they're underpaying EVERYONE compared to the rest of the industry and keep missing important milestones because they've driven out the top engineering talent.
Advice to Management
Staff your engineering teams, stop making middle management disappear from the picture for two months every year because they're so buried in meetings related to your performance nonsense, and structure your technology development teams in a way that doesn't force employees to meet across 4 different timezones on every corner of the planet every day. Your performance system and VPs treat the support teams as nonessential groups who can be gutted. Even your best engineers in TD get gated by hardware delays and logistics issues that come as a direct result of your staffing decisions, and that ripples out into missed milestones and lost revenue. You'll never have a 12 month cadence if you won't even spend the money on supporting lab equipment for basic bench debug work.

","You will absolutely work more than 65+ hours a week. You will go home after work and log on for 2-3 hours each day at night. 

Management will give you lip service about the culture surveys and how they intend to improve things. They will ask for ideas to improve working conditions and work life balance, and culture. This is purely for them to document they had the discussion. They have no interest in improving work life balance culture.

You’re expected to attend emails on vacation.

Treasury managers are great at their personal work. But when it comes to leading they suffer from social deficiency’s, and impaired emotional intelligence. 

Expect a cutthroat environment. Expect politics. Expect being asked to do things that you don’t believe are morally acceptable.

2021-08-10, Senior Manager,"Boise, ID","Current Employee, more than 10 years",A tech company that wants to be engaged in social engineering,"Great coworkers. Cutting edge technology. Good benefits though they've whittled away at time off benefits over the last few years.
","Very strong social/ political agendas. Hard to focus on the actual work. Embraces and pushes critical race theory without calling it that (lost count of the number of times I've been informed that I'm racist over the last two years by guest speakers and training). Forcing vaccines on new hires with clear signaling they will force on remaining workforce soon even though they PROMISED they would never do that. 

Low cap on number of promotions per year suppressing raises regardless of whether people meet (or exceed) the requirements. Forced distributing on performance ratings which significantly impact bonus payouts (tens of thousands of dollars difference). They say they they don't force it except at the higher levels (org greater than 100) but that just turns into tops down pressure behind closed doors to hit distributions. 

US attrition is backfilled in India with an open agenda to grow there. Result is every team feels under staffed and over worked. People are exhausted. These all compound to people leaving because job security feels less certain or because of burn out or that's the best way to get an overdue raise or better pay. 

Market adjustments are worse than a joke. Really a slap in the face. Multiple times we are breaking records or very clearly making huge profits and market adjustments are suspended or canceled. Add to that, when we do get them they are tiny (average in the 1-2% range) so most people are below the median pay. A 0.9 comparatio is considered doing very well. No matter how well we do, the message is, we need to tighten the belt and do more, faster cause things are uncertain. It has gotten old. 

Executive Management will not listen to feedback that is in opposition to policy or agenda. Talking to hr or direct leadership falls on deaf ears or, at best, gets sympathy but there is nothing they can do because it's very tops down driven.
Advice to Management
Stop with the social and political agendas. Let us focus on Engineering. Please stop trying to tell me I'm racist. Stop infringing on private, personal decisions like medical choices. 

Embrace your own ""value"" and innovate better ways to drive performance, raises and market adjustments. Stop following.

Employee stock purchase plan is a great benefit to encourage employees to stay with the company.
Colleagues are generally very friendly, but maybe too busy to help.
Welfare such as canteen food/coffee machine/transport is good.
Job scope is wide and the training is very comprehensive.
","Process side is severely understaffed and the employees are grossly overworked, and often supervisors foist work onto new hires who have to juggle their training while learning on the job.
Too many meetings and lull time waiting on information/input from others, meaning productivity at work is very poor and leads to unnecessary OT.
Learning curve is immensely steep especially for process integration/yield enhancement engineers.
Hiring process is not transparent at all and many new hires come in with the wrong expectations of their job role and responsibilities, and sometimes even offered a position that they did not apply for.
Advice to Management
There needs to be a greater focus on work life balance, with greater flexibility in work arrangements and expanding the teams faster to reduce the workload on employees. Management should also be more understanding of their team and try not to rush deadlines so hard if possible.

2021-07-13, Process Technician II,"Manassas, VA","Current Employee, more than 1 year",Only if You Have to,"Decent-ish pay...but highly variable start rates...if you enter this job with a bachelor, you must INSIST to be an engineer if at all possible, if not, only settle for a mid-level technician or senior technician spot. 

Because: Progress at the company is extremely slow and based on very strict and slim quotas, leaving behind many exceptionally productive and high-quality employees behind.

I would only recommend this work for either recent college grads for 1-2 years to stack money while looking for better 9-5 hour work, or potentially someone with no other medium income earning potential as they will hire just about any experience or education level.

Do NOT stay at this company longer than 2 years if you have a degree, or if you do you MUST become an engineer by that point or leave the company, otherwise you will be stuck there on shift 12 hour work for the rest of your life and won't have much to show for it.
","12 hour shifts, likely forced to do nights as condition of your hire.
Very very poor leadership, no one in mid-level management or below is willing to speak truth to power or advocate for shift employees.

High performers get either pitiful or no meaningful recognition while mistake-prone or willfully negligent employees are allowed to breeze by. 

Even if the company has strong profits, you are not guaranteed a raise, and if you get one it will be pitiful and barely eek out inflation.

Management is very tone deaf and usually will yell for things to be done without bothering to understand underlying issues.

Also, for a billion dollar company they are very willing and even pleased to have run-down and out of date accommodations and facilities. The place looks and feels forgotten, as will you eventually on your computer!

Overall: Do not take this job for longer than 2 years if you have literally any other career prospects, take it and while you have it just use it as a security to interview like mad and negotiate hard for a good job you want elsewhere.
Advice to Management
Learn from competitors to pay more, and value the people that operate your fabs.
Continuing to treat all techs like grunts will continue to revolve the door and keep only the truly desperate decent/good workers but also mainly just amass the heap of lazy and underperforming workers.

Good luck!

- Overtime pay is not as easy to claim now like it used to, unless you are in manufacturing.
- Fresh Graduates from SG Universities looking forward to that OT pay in Micron IT can forget about it =).

- Some of the systems dont have a CI / CD pipeline, some don't even have a proper testing frameworks in place.
- Technology stack might be very outdated depending on what system you are working on.
- The stuff you learn development wise, is irrelevant to the software industry.
- Most of the seniors working there are stuck because they don't up skill and whatever they know has become so irrelevant to the IT / Software industry that its hard to get out.

The work is extremely fast paced, as any issues with the manufacturing line need to be fixed ASAP. I personally find that this makes the job interesting and fulfilling, but it does mean that the job quickly swings between relaxed and high-stress. Thankfully it is relaxed more often than not.
","There is no hybrid Work From Home at this site for non-manufacturing job roles, despite good WFH performance during the Pandemic. This decision seemed to come from the executive level without feedback from engineering teams.

The Manassas site focuses on legacy part types, meaning there aren't a lot of high-level engineering positions available for growth opportunities (no R&D).

A few small complaints: The site looks and feels dated, with cubicle walls that have been there for at least 25 years. The old cafeteria was converted into more cleanroom space, meaning the current cafeteria is in a large trailer. The food on site isn't particularly good and costs a lot. There is a small gated outdoor patio to eat lunch on, but if you want to go outside for a walk to take a quick break from work, you need to exit and enter through security. Perhaps they could expand the gate around the building to enable access and more walking space.

2021-07-02, SeniorTechnician,,"Current Employee, more than 5 years","Great benefits, decent culture, poor sense of individuality, terrible at focusing on making memory","Benefits are great. Micron has their own internal ""university"" to help their employees learn desirable skills, from programming and code, data and leadership to dealing with stress and mental health issues. They offer paid therapy through a third party for traumatic life events. The list goes on. 
The culture has stagnated some as they've injected more and more politics. I don't necessarily disagree with the stances taken, but like many have said on the internal message boards: ""Can we please stick to making memory?"" That said, the culture is still above average.
","The sense of self and individuality is lost with such a large company. They try to prevent that, but I'm not sure there's much they can do. Also, global policies outrank the individual, so innovation at the local level is stifled. 
Micron is beholden to various groups that include the likes of Amazon, Walmart and other global Mega-corps. Their business decisions are obviously impacted by this. Although not always bad, they tend to favor the business without regard to the individual. One example would be Micron being forced to take a stance on a big event that happened without regard to the nuance and the feelings of individuals on both sides. Another is the pandering to certain groups, which has become in vogue for big business as of late. I'm all for equality, but don't pretend like it isn't about the moneys. Especially when leaves large swathes of your employees feeling left behind.

","Decision making is made at a much to high level. Managers are not allowed to make decisions for their team and are handcuffed to corporate dictatorship. (Example - during Covid, certain roles were forced to be onsite even if their responsibilities have been demonstrated to have no impact due to working from home.) And MANY other examples. 

Software rollouts for Micron's operations are EXCESSIVELY buggy and do not work as intended. The running joke is that the end users are the beta testers. The legacy systems are deactivated and end users are forced to deal with the new non-operational software.

Restrictions on the IT front are rampant. Many tracking policies are put in place and most permission policies are super intrusive and inhibitive. 

Many individuals have to spend more time covering their butts than doing their job. They spend more time asking permission to do things (and placing the blame if something goes wrong on others) than innovating and problem solving. This is how the management operates, if an individual makes a mistake, the management slams the door on their hands. This stifles innovation, and creates a workplace governed by fear.
Advice to Management
Stop mandating fab-wide rules from ""on high."" Allow managers to run their teams as they see fit - no mandates for attendance or the paltry WFH offerings from corporate drones. 

Stop punishing individuals for trying to make things better and innovating. If something goes wrong, treat is as a learning experience, gain knowledge from the event rather than starting paperwork on a mistake and making the workplace hostile to new ideas.

Advice to Management
The company is doing very well on the books thanks to the direction of the leaders, but credit also has to be given to the employees as well. It seems that the hard work of the employees has not been properly rewarded, especially during this pandemic season. 
It is good to be ambitious and aim high, but if there are so many priorities to achieve (cost savings, record production ramp, sustainability goals, diversity and inclusion, to name a few), it is becoming a detriment to collaboration since every department is clamouring to fulfill their own KPI. If everything is a priority, then what actually is your priority?

Under the pretty façade of a ""great place to work"" lies a pit of toxicity that constantly wears down ground workers from overwork and lack of incentive appreciation (lip service does not count). While company continues to strive for greater heights, the foundation is slowly crumpling from the weight of ambition.

You learn new skills that companies around the world would beg for in the Semiconductor industry, and not being micromanaged is a plus. You know your job and they let you do it
","Everything about the company is politics. If you need something to be successful, and they do not provide it for you, it is told to you under the pretense of what they think is best. You are not given the manpower to complete your duties and constantly stretch you too thin. There is no reward for doing well, and those who do nothing go unpunished. You are promised a salary review annually, but expect one maybe every 3-5 years. Short term, this is a great company, but if you have an issue your manager should be able to handle, you have to go up three more levels before your voice is even heard. If looking to make a career in this industry, this is a good starting company.
Advice to Management
Listen more to your employees. There are hundreds if not thousands of unhappy employees seeing the revenue increasing dramatically, but going years without a raise or promotion because they are told out of their team of 10-20, only 1 or 2 can receive one, and it is usually only received based on time with the company, not merit.

I enjoy the freedom to manage my own time and simply provide updates on occasion to the major projects I am driving.
","With the shift to the New Micron image under Sanjay I have to say at first I was very excited. They pitched it so well and made it sound like they were really in for their people. Being through that initial phase now I am seeing the reality behind the image being pushed. The Execs care only for the dollar and will take drastic measures to protect it. I have witnessed one site first greatly reduced in technicians and now being completely sold off. If you are looking for job security you may consider the trend of this company investing in its overseas fabs before taking a role at one of the US based sites.
Advice to Management
Please please work on your messaging. I cannot believe how little effort went into the two major life impacting announcements I have been part of. Many of us have given you decades of our lives bringing numerous awards and accomplishments yet when you announce that you have decided to sell the site you have something more important to rush off to. So disappointed when we got to see the true colors of the Executive Team.

","The workload is getting very heavy with all the things going on and system implementations. 
It appears that communication from the top and at the lower levels is starting to not match. The message we are hearing from the top is safety (related to COVID) is important, but seems as at lower levels that isn't the case.
Work boundaries are blurring as meetings start to encroach on all hours of the day since most TMs are still working from home. How will this work when we are back on site? This isn't sustainable for another 6 months or more.
Advice to Management
Please be transparent about everything at the company. Not just DE&I. You reinstated our raises but we still don't know what they are even though we are set to get them in a week or so. Also, we aren't sure how compensation is determined. There isn't a lot of transparency on that. It's even hard to get your market/compa ratio if you want to know it.
Make sure the messaging that you are sending to the company as a whole is matching what the TMs hear in their locations.

","Worklife balance has been destroyed by poor offshoring practices. Teams are split across the world requiring odd hour meetings to be the norm. They talk alot about work life balance, but aren't willing to make the small practical changes that would fix it.
Advice to Management
Align work and teams to function as complete units within a single time zone. Ensure that handoffs between teams are handled to maximize clarity and completeness. Follow through on work life balance talk.

Uncontrolled OT - Many employees audaciously manipulate it to gain more monetary benefits - OT does not mean an increase in productivity. Some employees come in on a Saturday up till afternoon and claim a full day of OT (lapse in the system). 

2. Supported by EDB

3. Trying their best to improve employees' happiness/mental health.
","Depending on department:

1. Some teams love to create exclusion groups, where they gossip and create a toxic culture. Mostly foreigners - same as many major companies. Some foreigners create their own cliques and try to influence the rest of the crowd with their culture. Extremely toxic. 

2. Salary - Not competitive. 

3. Work - Repetitive, no challenges.

4. Most of the people are frogs in the well. It seemed like they have been in the industry for so long, that they have forgotten how innovative and competitive other companies are. Most bosses would think that they are very knowledgeable but by the very matter of fact, they have lost touch with the society.

5. Individual departments just innovate on their own, with no proper consultation and/or documentation. It may not be a problem now, but as the scale grows larger, issues/problems will start to surface.

6. Great place to work (Singapore edition, but why not regional or world)? You may find your answers from other reviews.

Hire new managers that actually can manage people instead of statistics. Don't hire a manager just because he/she was the only person that applied for the job or because they have a PHD. Purge the good old boys club managers that have always been the cancer of the company.

","Varied leadership. Company does not have an effective checks and balance for poor lower/ mid level leadership. Poor leaders exist and they can pretty much ruin your career.
Advice to Management
The word of shift supervisors and lower level managers is accepted without question. No checks and balances exist to verify what they feed up the chain. There are some incompetent supervisors who unfairly terminate good team members with biased reporting. Senior management only gets to hear one side of the story.

Repor","The word of shift supervisors and lower level managers is accepted without question. No checks and balances exist to verify what they feed up the chain. There are some incompetent supervisors who unfairly terminate good team members with biased reporting. Senior management only gets to hear one side of the story. Make sure all points of view are examined before any ""performance improvement"".

","Forced ranking of employees (appraisal system) regardless of group size - has led to significant disruption due to turnover as we have had good team members leave the company. Poor work /life balance due to high workload vs. available staff.
Advice to Management
Scrap the forced ranking for a performance management tool that managers can / will be supportive of vs. one that forces all members of a team to compete against each other for the best rating (instead of working together to accomplish company objectives and making the whole team look good). Would also be good to have more action behind the words company leaders that speak to wanting employees to feel valued and to have work/life balance.

Many e-learnings at your disposal
(Theoretically) plenty of opportunities to shift your career.
","Poor work/life balance, plenty of overtime, often unnecessary, is expected (i.e. Engineer can't leave before the manager).
Substandard compensation/benefits.
Japanese company culture that can be demotivating to some: difficult communication and overall environment for non-Japanese speakers, strictly hierarchical with limited/no access of Engineers to local senior management, no outlooks for climbing the ladder on a timely manner, employee is ""owned"" by the company that can transfer and/or change his/her role without prior notice or a consultation

No instructor-led classes in English

It is clear that Boise wants to change the culture of MMJ. Some improvements have been made over the years but there is still a very long way to go and at this pace the company mentality will remain Japanese for many years to come.

Stop trying to address the current work life balance issue with the solution of Micron is now hiring more people. Because people will leave before those new hire can adapt to the work and the workload + complexity keeps increasing over time.

2021-01-20, Line Coordinator,"Boise, ID","Former Employee, more than 8 years",Spectek/Systems Integration,"Great coworkers, interesting work, community opportunities.

Coworkers: I still hang out with some regularly, and remain in contact with others on social media even though I haven't worked there since 2013/14.

The work was interesting, and catered to my work style. Every day was different unless we were in prototype hell. Even then we were usually working on something amazing that made my inner/outer nerd very happy.

The Micron Foundation is amazing. I have been volunteering with them even after my separation, this is the first year I haven't been at the NSB due to the pandemic and remote issues.
","The drive. I started at the Nampa plant and moved to Fruitland to be closer to family. Got transferred out to Boise. The long drive and 12 hour shifts were going to kill me. Carpools saved me for a while, I could nap on the drive in in the passenger seat vs the driver's seat. Wound up giving my commuter car to my coworker when I left.
Advice to Management
The personal development section of our quarterly evaluations changed my life. The encouragement and accountability, even though not monetized, led to the publishing of my first two novels. I left during a downturn to save job cuts for those that needed them, as Amazon was paying me quite well at that time. It enabled me to be active in my daughters' lives in a way I hadn't been able to in a while.

I still encourage employers to add a personal component to evaluations for this reason, and always recommend Micron as a good company to grow with, and if possible, out of.

I know it doesn't happen often, but my site manager let me back in for a potluck after my separation (had to have a babysitter). I also came back to bring pizza for the crew to celebrate my 3rd book launch. Little touches like that make the perception that a company can't care if they're too big fly right out the window.

","Working conditions are a disaster. I literally (yes literally) spend 10 hours a day in a 6 foot by 2 foot cube with walls that are only 4 feet high. (It's supposed to be an open atmosphere that fosters collaboration...right.)

Very little trust and not a ton of integrity, though I think that has more to do with how big the corporation is rather than direct intent from employees or management. Peoples intentions are good, but their desire to protect their position or career in such a big corporation seem to drive them (and me) to do some strange things.

There is a tendency to play dumb to promises or commitments and then only deliver when asked about it, or play even dumber. It's pretty clear that Micron's not there to benefit you, you are there to benefit them.
Advice to Management
Trust your employees. Stop questioning if they're doing their work or not. And above all else, keep your promises. We want Micron to be just as successful as anyone else, we don't need to be stepped on to lift the company up to greater heights.

- Relatively easy work
","The department I'm in is extremely dysfunctional. The service manager I interviewed with resigned on my first day, and his replacement quit about two months after he was hired due to burnout. The company seems to punish anybody who will step into a leadership role with an incredibly unhealthy work-life balance, which disincentivises anybody else from taking on more responsilbility. 

The company culture is INCREDIBLY corporate/soulless. Even for a Fortune 500 company it's bad.

In September, the executive staff decided they wanted to start bringing everybody back into the offices in America, even though there was a global pandemic underway and we were bound to end up having to re-close after putting hundreds of people at risk for COVID. For obvious reasons, the endeavor never went through. That being said, I was basically presented with the choice of either sucking it up and returning to the office with hundreds of other people in it, or being forced to quit/be fired, which meant I would have had to repay my relocation package, and forfeit any unemployment assistance in a very uncertain job market.
Advice to Management
Stop talking about how much you care about work-life balance and take meaningful steps into fixing it. 

Encourage people to take ownership instead of making leadership roles a meat grinder that only deter other team members from stepping up.

","A showoff culture. Company doesnt care about employees. They just try to show off that they care. Higher management decision is not employee friendly. They find any silly reason not to give hike and stocks. Compensation is bad. They try to poach talent from big companies by giving higher joining salary but later they don't give hikes and stocks to compensate for what extra they paid to lure talent. 
Facility and HR teams are from service based companies and they think that they are doing big favor by providing facilities like food, cab. They are often rude and they don't take any action when an employee complains. They are so miser that they are reluctant in giving even stationary items. IT infrastructure is bad. IT resources doesn't meet engineering requirement. Working here is tough. No monetary recognition here.

2020-10-30, Project Manager,,"Former Employee, more than 8 years",Re-org fatigue and individuals competing for visibility at the expense of shared goals,"Company practices pay-for-performance so rewards and recognition can be pretty generous if you are a high-performer. In terms of welfare, the company promotes employee health and wellness with many benefits and perks (gyms, travel vouchers redemption, company discounts etc.). Ample growth and development opportunities with many high-visibility and challenging projects. Colleagues work well with one another generally. Most part of company values are in place.
","Some toxic leaders and colleagues (guess that happens everywhere). Some good leaders left the company under mysterious circumstances, others get promoted when they are not quite ready (if you lobby hard enough with some myopic or narcissistic bosses, you can get promoted or land yourself in high-visibility roles ahead of your readiness/potential). People work hard with long-hours but does not always produce high-quality results in part due to aptitude and abilities (including EQ). Re-orgs are not uncommon.
Advice to Management
Do a better job promoting/hiring the right people especially for leadership roles. Mentor/coach leaders and those new in key project roles to equip them with the right values/mindset and win as a bigger team (if your immediate team wins at the expense of making other teams lose, that's still not team). Some leaders should really get their act together and grow up faster in their leadership maturity. Leave your egos at the door please.

There has been an expectation to have 100% of all engineers back on-site. I can't think of any other company in Silicon Valley that's done this.

The overall culture of the company definitely skews more conservative and corporate. You won't find free lunches and large off-sites here. Stack ranking is still enforced here and performance ratings come only from your direct manager.

Young working environment, able to forge lasting relationships with peers. Great D&I (Diversification & Inclusion) to ensure employees are from all walks of life regardless of physical ability, age, race, language or religion. Various employee resource groups ensure employees have the platform to engage in their interests and passions, like various sports groups. Lastly, the work culture which used to be open and free where focus was not on the number of hours spent at desk but on the quality of work done.
","Being a MNC of substantial size, communication can be lacking at times. Any new or changes to procedures are often not adequately communication to relevant stakeholders. This can lead to loss of productivity, or even conflict from miscommunication. Other major flaw in the management system is there are many gaps in the HR system such that incompetent management gets rewarded with promotion or can stay in senior management role. Many HR policies or core values of the organisation are being violated without any detection. Most employees either are not aware of the whistleblowing platform, or do not dare to utilise it fearing repercussion.

Improve management systems to detect errant management, so toxic management styles won't propagate at the current rate. Stick to the company core values, do what you say and say what you do.

- there is an atmosphere of dullness , negative-ness and fear. Across departments and among departments shouting happen occasionally.
- older employees and managers who survive are usually more cunning and keep those documents to themselves to gain control. New employees have no choice but to obey them and they are given little piece of needed parts for certain tasks instead of the detailed overall design for better understanding.
- management introduced rating system for improvement whereby you can rate and comment for every aspect of work including managers, peers, work life balance, learning prospect etc. However, when give neutral rating only , managers come to you and request to change to higher rating.

2020-09-16, Technician,"Manassas, VA","Current Employee, more than 8 years",Do Not Work For Micron | Newcomers Not Welcome,"You can start working if you have a GED, actually you don't even need that.
","""Diversity and Inclusion"", ""Micron does not tolerate harassment of any kind"", you will find this in the Micron Policies and Standard manual for all employees--THIS IS ALL A LIE.

Even if you are in middle-management you better hope and pray that you get into a popular group; the culture is worse than high-school.

HR is a joke!

There are two types of employees at Micron:

Worked more than 10+ years and pigeon holed into one department. Great at what they do, but they have been beaten into submission through poor management. They are constantly in fear of losing their job, they don't submit new ideas and they keep under the radar.

Worked for Micron less than 10 years, they have a slight glimmer in their eyes of hope for a future with the company. They have been passed up for promotion every year for at least five years and management only sees them when they do something perceived as wrong.
Advice to Management
The newcomers are the future of your company, listen to them, and take note of when they say there is a problem. I guarantee that if you performed an anonymous survey of all your employees with less than five years, they would say they have been treated poorly.

When someone approaches HR and they say they are being harassed by another employee--TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTION! Move the employee to another shift/building/location and then perform your investigation. Do not wait a day, week or month to investigate their claim/s. Do NOT tell that person they brought on themselves. Ever. Their is no justification for harassment of any kind.

If you expect your company to make it into the future, you need to start treating you current newcomers like they are people. Maybe I am not getting through to you? Maybe this will help you understand;

Your new employees are a FOUP of blank wafers, just starting the process, and they have 150+ steps to their retirement. When you randomly test some of those wafers going through the process and you see defects; do you blame the wafers for their defects? No, you source the cause of the issue and find the tool responsible. That tool could have been on the fab floor for 20+years and now it is breaking wafers. I know you would not let a piece of equipment run that continues to break wafers...so why would you let an employee treat their fellow employees in a damaging manner?

2020-09-03,Anonymous,,"Current Employee, more than 8 years",Strenuous work life balance and you will be squeeze dry especially working across USA and Asia time zone.,"Flexible working timing although we work basically 24hrs per day since there are so many job at hand. Most deliverables are open ended allowing some autonomy from individual to be creative.
","Work life balance is terrible, and upper management does not bother or seemingly no power to do so. You will see some teams shaking legs while others are slogging daily, weekends and public holiday included. 

Employee lack courage to speak up due to authoritative management mainly from Asia region. Yes-boss people are everywhere contributing to very imbalance working culture.

Internal software systems does not link to each other contributing to massive manual jobs for engineers. IT support to create tools/software is extremely difficult to come by. People are working like on 90s, only difference is the paperwork are in excelsheets.

Laptops/workstation given are bogged down with too many scanning software making computer usage extremely tiring with sluggishness and slow downs. Technology company must have latest and greatest machines for employees. Refresh every 2 years at minimum.
Advice to Management
Make sure you have capable metrics to measure every job given to team members. Otherwise you cannot properly redeploy resources as you cannot sufficiently justify. Be courages and do not always throw your team member under the bus and let them swollow all the work for you.

2020-07-27, Engineer,"Boise, ID","Current Employee, more than 1 year",So-so,"* Smart people
* Stable industry
* Profitable company
* A lot of freedom to do what you want
","* Some of the smartest people are not cut out for management. We need real managers, not just idea people.
* No project management. You can be a level 1 engineer, and be expected to plan, timeline, communicate, design, implement, and qualify an entire project yourself. If you slip in any category, nobody will recognize you.
* Layoffs still happen despite profitability
* Exercising your freedom to go above and beyond gets eyes on you asking why you bother.
* Why do we have a CEO that lives out-of-state from our HQ?
Advice to Management
* Stop looking at everything people do as a problem, and look at it as a solution.
* Give praise where praise is due
* Understand that your employees care. They aren't here to make your life miserable, as you may think.

2020-07-26, Process Engineer,"Boise, ID","Current Employee, more than 3 years",Just Ok - A few years away from real progress,"The ""new"" CEO is pushing the company to be a technology leader and has made significant investments in R&D, infrastructure, and HVM expansion. In the past few years the executive team has put a greater emphasis on building a stronger company culture with a focus on employee satisfaction. The company has great benefits and strives to reward employees (cash/stock bonuses and discounted stock offerings). Starting compensation is average but promotions/pay increases are lackluster, especially considering strong market performance and record profits in the past few years. I can see the company making significant improvements in 2-5 years.
","The company is moving in the right direction, but progress has been slow and disjointed. There is resistance to change within the company, especially from employees who have worked here for their entire 20+ year career. Some departments are understaffed due to high attrition rates, leaving little bandwidth for high impact projects or personal development. In addition, training is either dated or non-existent so be prepared to leverage outside resources on your own time if you want to develop as an engineer. Career advancement is limited for the aforementioned reasons. Management is aware of the challenges in these areas but prefers to maintain the status quo. They claim significant progress has been made but employees will make lateral career moves within or outside the company to escape dead end departments.

I started in a position that I was interested in but quickly out grew as my talents were put to better use elsewhere. During the orientation they tell stories about how a guy/girl started out as a menial laborer and is now a VP due to hard work and dedication. When I hear these stories I typically disregard them as yet another motivational ""rags to riches"" story, at micron this is more then just a motivational tool but an actual fact and possibility. I have been in many different work environments and this one is far and above the best. Even at its worst there is always a light at the end of the tunnel, never is there that trapped feeling where you think that you just have to put up with the situation you are in or leave to a different company.

Fairly good teamwork between departments.
Good focus on efficiency and improvement projects.
Open to new ideas, especially from new hires.
Good place for a first job in the semicon industry.
Very good compensation (for degree holders) but annual leave is 14days for new hires.
Fairly sufficient training
","Likes to keep very lean teams, meaning quite alot of OT depending on the crunch time and which department you're in.
New hires get arrowed to take up ""CCAs"" like setting up booths for team building events which to me is a waste of time and energy, I would prefer time offs.
Management always buys the minimum number of machines and then complains when you can't meet the occasional high throughput KPIs.
Very age-ist: if you're in your 40s and not a manager, get ready to be laid off 
Rating system that affects salary is very degrading and demoralizing.
Advice to Management
Rating system is dehumanizing and please do not complain about low throughput when you purposely buy the min. number of machines and expect us to somehow magically increase throughout drastically. Mandatory good catch submission is also not feasible. Engagement survey to gauge management's KPI is superficial and useless when you just ignore our work life balance concerns just because you yourself don't have a life outside of work.

","I would not address more details as if you surf back to older reviews by real old Micron employees, not the fake 4,5 stars by new comers, you should find that Micron has changed to an Asia-based company. As a CEO, he is good to satisfy stockholders; but what he brought into Micron, no matter the peoples from Sandisk or else is trampling old Micron employees, and that’s why they are recruiting the newbies to replace them. I only worked here for 4 years, but already feel the ridiculous. I’m not saying I don’t know why they are doing this; it’s more like a final alarm to me and my friends, it’s time to leave for better places with more steady management.

Pay is decent but can take years to work up to a salary north of six figures if you do not have a PhD. Micron respects the degree above all else. Hands down, I have had the pleasure of working with some of the BEST people over my career.
","Shifting priorities seemingly overnight. Split (by design) departments must cohabitate, but each is held to significantly different standards. Therefore issues occur when work is getting done in the manufacturing area. Also, if you do not have the word 'manager' in your job title, your ability to lead and drive change is extremely limited. I joined leadership because I thrive in this role. However, I quickly became disillusioned due to lack of authority and make decisions regarding people's performance evaluations and year rewards. Do not get me wrong, I am not power-hungry, I don't care about that. It's just that I have to go to my boss for everything to be approved. Just hope you have a good manager in charge of you otherwise it can feel like you are a babysitter.

Allow leaders at all levels to manage their people. Place trust in all your leaders, not just your managers, that they can properly manage and lead people.

","1) Complete cultural change since Sanjay took over the company. Making employees compete against each other for their jobs with the current review system. Each year the review systems forces employees within each group into a bell curve. The employees at the bottom of the bell curve are eliminated.

2) Laying off people while they are hiring at the same time.

3) Corporate leaders spewing lies about ""work life balance"" but people always working late and on the weekend to meet their goals.

4) HR group is worthless; I would never go to HR with a problem. Right now employees have no protection from a bad boss at Micron. HR is a bunch of yes men and simply go along with what the managers says.
Advice to Management
Stop lying to employees. ""Collaboration"" is a corporate value, yet the new review system makes employees compete against each other for their jobs. And the number one value is ""People, we care about each other"", yet Sanjay lays off 5% of the workforce, mostly the major contributors and experienced engineers, such as principle engineers and senior fellows.

Overhaul the HR group so they actually serve a purpose, and provide some protection for the employee.

There are a few good engineering managers at Micron, but most are just promoted engineers with no management skills; They make terrible managers and walk around like they are better than everyone else. Micron should implement the ""manager who serves"" philosophy.

","Cyclical business and downturns are common in this industry. Since the focus is on the $, employees have little value. Most companies have to instill cost cutting measures during their life cycle. Do not expect a fair or respectable treatment at this company - there is a pending case in Idaho based on the company intentionally rating employees lower to reduce costs by terminating them and saving on performance rewards that would be due to employees. This is still happening at some level inspite of the rhetoric the company is pedaling. Do your due diligence by talking to current and former employees.

Management has made great progress. It’s a great place to work. I recommend more verbal encouragement of a healthy work-life balance culture. This is only possible by proper prioritization, and cutting somethings out. I admit, this is real tough to do in this competitive environment.

Stop the rank and yank. Ranking employees doesn't make things better it just makes everyone compete against their coworkers. Competing does not help morale. You say you care about people, then stop making things worse.

","1. Work life balance 2018-2019 was extremely terrible. Unfortunately, many people did not work because they had interest/passion in the specific field they were working on, but instead work because of an atmosphere of fear created by higher management knowingly or unknowingly. 
2. There were too many unnecessary meetings held. Some were related to how to improve work life balance in the company, others being on performance review.
3. Even those who did not care about OT and just wanted to work during official hours had no other option but to work extra time sometimes even during weekends. 
4. Learning saturated for some people in the company. Exploring interest by switching departments is difficult.
Advice to Management
Don't create atmosphere of fear, you will lose people in long term. Everyone is not motivated by money. Work overload slows productivity. If work in the semiconductor industry is demanding, hire accordingly rather than burden employees with too much work.

OT pay with a cap of 6.2k
","Things are getting out of control with too heavy top structure, too little manpower to actual make things work.
Senior engineers tend to be stagnant and in fact getting unproductive thus offloading work to newcomers, which makes a bad cycle
Too much politics ongoing especially with new teams being formed to compete with each other, even though with lesser expertise just purely due to certain higher management has a say, and with most if not all the contributions being snapped
Too many central teams with a lot of manpower snapped from frontend, which comes up with ideas while the actual workload is being done by FE team, and snapping the credits
Resources are also focus on teams especially related to product development and process engineers, evaluation performance consistency is always a known issue but no concrete fix
Whoever is capable do more, without very distinct performance evaluation treatment/compensation, a very bad Asian mindset
Culture is just a slogan while no one is practicing, especially in Singapore.
Advice to Management
To revitalise the workforce especially seniors who are stagnant
Lesser politics
Evaluation performance consistency is always an issue with no concrete fix, instead, finding excuses and reasons, without admitting that resources are always biased. A lot of potential employees have left mainly due to this.

2020-02-17, Principal Product Engineer,"Boise, ID","Former Employee, more than 10 years",Disappointing end....,"Great pay and benefits. For Boise the pay is very good. A bit too much of the compensation is dependent upon the bonus and stock segments of the compensation. If ALL you are looking for is money then its a good place to work.
","Workload, HR policies, work environment, lack of internal job transfers, no work life balance. 

Workload/HR Policies. I can't speak for the new grads or junior engineers but as a senior/principal level engineer the work load and job demands are unsustainable. Management will put performance requirements on you so you have to work so many hours to keep up that you have no afterwork life. Management pushes you hard by using the whip of the ""stacked ranking"" system. They say they don't have quotas but it is obvious they do. And when caught and sued they backed off a bit. But I suspect after the dust settles on the lawsuit over the ranking quotas they will go back to it with a vengeance. 

Work environment. With the ranking performance system I was beginning to see the fruits of that in that employees starting to cut corners, backstab other employees, and management playing employees against each other. This makes for a miserable existence. You are constantly looking over your shoulder and trying to give the illusion that you are happy and collaborating. 

If you're and older employee or a long time Boise employee watch out. They are working to exterminate you. Management sends a clear message that we only want young workers. The whole Diversity and Inclusion thing does not include older more experienced workers. Just a diverse new ""top tier"" new grad worker population. 

There are no careers at Micron. Just jobs. Lots of them.. if you are a young new grad. As a senior engineer there are very few opportunities for you to move around. It seems very difficult to move around because they only want to hire new grads thus shutting out seasoned and experienced senior level engineers from moving in a direction they would like their career to go. So you have to leave. 

It pains me to say these things. Micron had been good to me and my career for many many years. It was only around 2017/2018 that it took a turn for the worst. It used to feel like family but not anymore. You are just a piece of tooling that when you show the first signs of wear or break down they throw you away. Heaven forbid you get ill and can't keep up.
Advice to Management
Lose the ""stacked ranking"" performance management. This leads to a very toxic and non-inclusive work environment. It may work in a dog fighting ring or for Wall Street brokers but it should not be used in a professional engineering work environment. Management and motivation should not be through fear and intimidation but through respect and inspiration.

Advice to Management
Stop with the hypocrisy and talk that sounds nice when you do things to undermine employee morale (laying off workers, adding unnecessary stress that comes from the top down, controlling our vacation time, not paying severance). Build up the workers skillset and self esteem by not constantly nitpicking them and giving time for training and career growth.

2019-12-11, Revenue Accountant,Singapore,"Former Employee, less than 1 year",Pass on this job if you're truly an accountant,"My supervisor was amazing and worked hard to make herself available to her staff. I also really enjoyed the autonomy of just being able to do my job without being micromanaged.
","This is where it gets dicey. I wasn't at Micron for a long period of time, long enough to know that it was not what I wanted to do long term. If you're someone who needs a variety of tasks; this job isn't for you. If you're someone who wants to make a difference or has ideas about change management; this job is not for you. My job consisted of ""managing"" revenue for a sole distributor who did pretty much whatever they wanted. This distributor is larger than Micron ever will be and Micron fails to see that this distributor will not adhere to Micron's ways. Rather than finding a solution or instituting any kind of change; we were just forced to go through meeting after meeting about how horrible this distributor was. Micron is not interested in a solution to their problem; instead they're just going to go through multiple accountants who will eventually realize that this is a dumpster fire that is never going to be put out....and they leave. 

That is just the Con about the job itself; there is a whole list of cons about the company overall. People talk about the longevity of the staff here but when you actually talk to these employees they all the say the same thing; that the work sucks and the company blows but Micron pays better than everyone else so they're enslaved by their paychecks. It's a very common theme here. So is there rank and file system. I was never made aware of their ""forced ranking system"" performance management system. Had I known about it, I wouldn't have considered the offer. That's an archaic way to manage people and all it does is instill mistrust and encourages competition among teammates instead of collaboration. This has been the most depressing environment I have ever worked in, and I've worked for the IRS if that tells you anything. The finance area is a sea of narrow, high walled, gray cubicles and there is zero natural light on this floor. No one really talks to each other because we're all viewed as competition and nothing about this place encourages collaboration which fits in well with the ""every man for himself"" mentality that is prevalent here. This isn't a company....it's the Hunger Games.
Advice to Management
Don't ever start a conversation with ""I've gotten feedback""; all that tells people is that you listen to gossip. Revisit your org structure. You have senior members who are familiar with a program and have worked out all the kinks and quirks, have them turn the smoothed out distributors over to the newer members and let them focus on handling the more challenging distributors. Handing a flaming bag of garbage to a new guy and telling him to ""make the system work for you"" when he has no idea how the system works from top to bottom is just going to cost you more accountants in the long run. If you're burning through employees left and right, you need to realize there is a problem with the job itself. Throwing gasoline onto a fire isn't going to fix it.

2019-12-07, Manufacturing Technician,"Manassas, VA","Current Employee, more than 5 years",Lengthy But Must Read,"Decent benefits, possiblity of year end bonus, gym membership. If you are hourly, you can earn a lot in overtime.
","Micron as a whole is reactionary rather than proactive which makes for frequent changes that are difficult to recover from. it preaches work life balance but the unspoken expectation is to work overtime to cover staffing issues. The company also preaches diversity and inclusion engagement in the employee resource groups but don't provide time for and punish participation ""to meet business needs."" 

The Manassas, VA location has the most toxic culture of all sites. It's a unique pressure cooker of stress that does not exist in other sites. The employees throw each other under the bus to cover their mistakes, don't recognize hard work, are two-faced, don't have accountability, and overall are miserable from being over-worked. Managemet is so far removed from the Fabrication process that the expectations and attitudes are unforgiving. Promotions are only given to yes-men rather than those qualified for the position. Perception is more important than achievements. The pattern at Fab 6 is to push more responsibilities onto existing team members rather than backfill open positions. The extra effort is rarely rewarded and regonized. Currently, Fab 6 is in the middle of an expansion which has been bungled from the start. Rather than extending the parking lot or make a garage, make shift parking was made after construction started and more people were on sight. The added parking is dangerous which is made worse by driving behaviors.

From talking to current and former employees, the overall sentimnet is they stay for the paycheck only.
Advice to Management
PRACTICE WHAT YOU PREACH. Fully staff the team to lessen the burden of existing employees so that they can all achieve success rather than burn out. Provide time for work life balance and to support employee resource groups. Don't hire managers just for promotion purposes but actually make sure they are ready and are qualified to be leaders. Provide supervisors time to actually advise and support the team rather than overloading them with tasks from other positions. Provide department trainers on shift for Fab employees. Training on the job is impossible with the unreasonable expectations and pressure of manufacturing. The attention is focused on running the line and making moves rather than education and fostering success. Upper management presaches that they should escalate issues but middle management hides them rather than address them. Fab 6 says that issues can be escalated through each manager until the problem is solved but instead people are punished for jumping the approval queue. Actually retain talent rather than under-paying and over-working the talent you do have.

","The organization or department where I had worked for over 20 years was shifted overseas, however, there was no real opportunity for myself to continue working for the company. I was unable to find a growth opportunity for myself where I felt that I would be able to facilitate a career of interest for me. Also, I was restricted from being able to obtain assistance in expanding my knowledge base because tuition assistance was restricted or offered only if it applied to my current position at the company as opposed to helping me to expand into a slightly different career field.
Advice to Management
If you want to continue to retain loyal and engaged employees then a consideration would be to ensure at all technical levels that your staff has the ability to grow into regions of interest outside of their employment field.

2019-10-23, Senior Engineering Manager,"Punggol,","Current Employee, more than 10 years",Great! Moving forward can be greater else worst...,"Great inherited culture from Intel side which promotes respect and integrity at working level. There is a risk of influx of talk only and no integrity culture from top down, but then let’s see.

Good pay and development opportunity if you are a fresh grad, or if you are a female vying for Mgr/Exec/VPs it is advantageous due to the Diversity & inclusion drive to fill the female quota, you just need to beat the closest contender.

Competitive compensation for performer (assumption is you also happen to have your bosses likes you). Else, the salary is recently adjusted to match industry standard.

Preferential hiring priority and reduced performance requirement over others if you fulfil criteria such as from S company, or knows someone from there.

CEO does have a compelling strategy, evidently shown in the stock price rise. The move for forced distribution of Low rating performer matches the approach by other big players like tsmc etc, good if you are in an org full of slackers, but not good if your boss manages the org well and everyone performs. I do support the move to this rating system.
","Depending on your org, work life balance can be either bad or good.
Massive org, and overlapping functions across org.

Cons if you are a performer, and inside a stellar performing team, and not associated to S company umbrella. Otherwise, this is a good company to work with.
Advice to Management
The forced rating is a good approach. Need to make sure that the influx of foreign hires also practise integrity and meritocracy based job promotion, not talk big and then show false performance data and get promoted. Walk the talk of integrity.

- Teammates were great and helpful.
- Relaxing work environment, aside from on-call duty, work isn't particularly stressful.
","- Codebase is a huge mess. The application I worked on is poorly architected, does not scale and fails regularly. 
- Whoever wrote the application has no concept of data structures (no set or dictionary used, only arrays), design patterns or SOLID principle.
- very high technical debt
- no code reviews, bad code is being checked in constantly. 
- no sign of unit tests, refactoring, CI/CD.
- adopts agile/scrum, but in practice most things are done in a very ad-hoc fashion (no sprint review, retrospective)
- Pumping out code and closing stories are valued more than good design and code quality

Probably not a place for aspiring Software Engineers who wants to hone their skills and learn from the best.

You can succeed if you work many hours and play politics well. Some people fit well, some don't, so take it with a grain of salt.
","The usual big tech company fare: pointless meetings, BS politics, evening calls (read: bad work/life balance), lack of willingness to promote people in order to keep the balance sheet looking good, performance reviews that may lead to firing, seducing new college grads to join on cheap while pushing out the older, expensive folks, providing more jobs overseas for cheaper labor instead of domestic.

Micron's new leadership wants the company to follow the Silicon Valley model, which is great if you're in California with lots of tech jobs available. Boise, not so much. Micron is basically Sandisk now with all of the new leadership in place.

2019-09-11, IT Systems Engineer,,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",IT Engineer,"High basic salary, OT claim, free medicine, meal can be bought in company
","Very poor work life balance, I always did OT to complete tasks and former manager did not appreciate my hard work. The performance review was very toxic, it was conducted each twice weeks, manager will discuss about my work, but instead manager tried to point out some minor mistakes from many works I had done nicely. Then the manager used those weaknesses to threat me that I failed to fulfill the job role's requirement. The appraisal system is the worst, I have been selected as low performer which was why manager threatened me during performance review. 
Basically this job paid you a decent salary to do tremendous tasks, and squeezed you and created negative environment which meant growth for them, then forced you to leave without any appreciation.

","Management style could be better for project managers and managers in general. The work/life balance is abhorrent. Paid well, but you earn it for sure. For the first 20+ years it was a awesome place to work. Then after the new CEO, Sanjay Mehrota was hired, everything changed. It became just another California company. All the things that made it a great place to work were eliminated and they decided to open two locations in India for the rank and file positions.

","More layoffs are on the books for Boise in January 2020. Three straight years of continuous layoffs here, not looking good, someone wants Boise gone. Let’s cut so many people so that Boise can not possibly succeed, then we can blame them for failing and shut them down for good. I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy. Once you do get laid off, you will have to move out of state for a decent job because Boise has no other tech jobs. It’s just not worth it to come here.

Work place politics will make you want to kill yourself. Kurt Cobain style.
The bad apples congregate like a pack of wolves, some good people herd together for protection. Be ware of the prior. know how to root out wolves in your heard.
They will eat their own doesn't matter if you've been there 19 or 29 years they will give you a 'completely voluntary severance package just so they can boost their quarter losses by liquidating those retirement funds. 

like many other corporations they have their issues. 

It took a longer than normal time to even get considered for promotion, as compared to all my other pals who got jobs in other companies. it's hard because they were trying to make promotions more equal for all, which just made lazy people slack further and actually hard working people to bang their head against a wall.

A vocally said target: Embrace business volatility. Yes. running around with your head chopped off and then getting curbed stomped simultaneously. That's volatility! 

management bullying tactics made me want to die. 

sometimes you'll work weekends when things are going crazy. this was normal. after a while I just refused and would work harder during the week. still asked to work weekends. 

They're Values are so morally misguided that any pro-culturism is completely gone in my book.

Advice to Management
Many aspects of how Micron 'does business' are too complex or have been given too much latitude to operate without boundaries over the years. Seems like this is partially due to acquisitions and partially due to unprecedented growth - but now, there is a need for unification and consolidation of procedures and policies across the company that would greatly help simplify operations, reducing overhead, cost, and error. We need to get everyone speaking the same language, adhering to the same procedures across business units (where possible), and clarify and simplify execution expectations. Easier said than done, but I think this would greatly increase productivity and satisfaction.

","Management from top to bottom is incompetent. They layoff people who shouldn't be laid off and keep their buddies around who throw the work they're supposed to be doing down the totem pole. If you're older than 55 start looking elsewhere because agesim is in full swing(I'm young btw). They don't even know the 12 hour shift workers exist. They send out emails telling us to have a great holiday with our families even though we don't get holidays off. I've applied for other positions only to be passed on with management stating I didn't meet the requirements even though I did. I found out several people received interviews despite having the same credentials as me (some had less education than me and had been written up) and they even received answers to the interview questions. If you're not one of the good old boys, move along. Greed rules this once great company, but doesn't rule me.

","1. No work life balance
2. Management and even your direct boss believe in using their authority to ask you to do work. Regardless what logic or if it's your responsibility, they tend to use ""Because i'm your boss, that's why when I asked you to do, you just have to do"" practice
3. A lot of office politics. Management likes employee who is the yes girl/guy
4. The company practice is horrible 2 points rating system. Every year, each team has to rate 1 person at least 2/5 for his/her performance rating. The moment you are rated 2, you are asked to pack your bag and leave the company without any compensation package. And this practice applies every year, to every team. This give the bosses privilege to kick people out of the company easily. 
5. Restructuring and retrenchment is going on in the company. Departments were outsourced. The company are giving out retirement package as a form of retrenchment to the senior and more expired employee. In return, they are looking at hiring ONLY fresh graduate with no experience. A form of cutting cost. 
6. They are forcing people to clear leave to cut cost
7. If you are fresh graduates or cheap labour, this is a good company to use as a jumping board. But if you are an experienced or senior worker, please don't come in.
Advice to Management
Stop the 2 rating system and focus on providing the employee an encouraging working environment. Result is not everything. Effort is the area that the management should take into consideration.

2019-07-06, Engineer,"Boise, ID","Current Employee, more than 8 years",Hard to say anything positive about the work environment right now,"Micron used to be an amazing place to work. Micron is more profitable than it's ever been right now and provides a consistent paycheck. 
There's still some hope Micron could be an amazing place to work again someday.
","I don't want to be honest about these right now because it's so bad and I used to love my job... The ranking system has created a toxic work environment, lowest morale ever seen at the company. Lot's of jobs being moved from US to overseas. Company is very sneaky about reducing work force in such a way that layoffs don't have to be reported to reduce numbers and it's hurting talented engineers careers. The work environment quickly changed from feeling like a career to feeling like a job. Constructive feedback to management leads to low rankings (removal from company) and responses such as ""this is the way Micron is now"". It's very clear that US employees are not valued at this company. Hard to grow as an engineer at this company right now due to the ranking system.
Advice to Management
Listen to your employees. Be honest with your employees, it looks really bad when you say one thing and do another. Expecting experienced employees to train less experienced employees doesn't work well with a ranking system in place. If you think you must have a ranking system, make it transparent so lower ranking employees can plan for it and leave on their own terms. You should be fostering a culture that is working together to be better than the competition instead of fostering a culture of competition with each other in hopes the output is better than a team working together. If your vision is what's best for micron, share it with the employees, help them understand why it's the best for micron. If you can't do that, then it's probably not really whats best for micron.

","There is no company culture at all. There are many days in the office where I returned home without speaking to even one person. I have made a fair effort to speak to many people and they seem uninterested.

People eat lunch in their cubicals and hardly speak to others. I am feeling that this is a highly mechanical work environment where the human values are not valued at all.

I don't know if higher management is aware of this decay of ethos and culture in the company. But I strongly feel that it is going to dent the company in longer run.

2019-06-30, Engineer,,"Current Employee, more than 10 years",Good company but employees don't feel valued,"The most positive aspect of working at Micron is that the Semiconductor Manufacturing Industry is an interesting work environment for all disciplines of engineering. There is a large variety of systems and processes which require curious technical people to maintain, troubleshoot and upgrade. Memory chip technology improves every 12 months so change is constant. If you like change, you will love it.
","Despite their superficial efforts, Management has never been able to make people feel valued. Sure, they love to say ""people are our most valuable resource"" but don't demonstrate it. Everyone working at Micron knows that the factories, processing machines, and raw materials cost billions and are really the most valuable assets. To make things worse, Micron has recently adopted a forced-ranking performance management system that forces managers to use the full distribution of ratings (1 through 5) during yearly performance reviews. This is like the old GE system of terminating 10% of the workforce every year to create turnover. There are many experienced and talented employees at Micron and some groups are mostly comprised of these types. This forces managers of those groups to artificially rate people high and low. This leads to employees distrusting the process and Management and reduces collaboration due to internal team competition. Please note that Micron Top Management would claim that what I'm saying about the forced-ranking is not true, but I've talked with a number of mid-level managers, off the record and they've confirmed it.
Advice to Management
Eliminate the new, forced-ranking process and use a simple performance management process that examines the work people are actually doing in light of the goals of the team. Look at teams as groups of individuals that bring different skills to the work. Evaluate the contribution of people to the team instead of comparing them to some biased standard of the ""high performer"". Managers, tell people you value their contributions to the team and talk straight to low and high performers. The current system is dishonest and borderline unethical.

2019-06-28, Senior Engineer,"Boise, ID","Former Employee, more than 10 years",Don't Say I Didn't Warn You.,"Boise is a beautiful city, though growth is out of control. If you are young, inexperienced, fresh out of school, and desperate, this could be a springboard to a job at another company that you might actually like to work for. The CEO and upper management are not contributing to the overcrowding in Boise by actually bothering to move here and experiencing what used to make Micron special and and family oriented. Perfect place to work if you crave the absentee slumlord/landlord experience.
","Now for the bad news:
1. Micron does not care about their people nearly as much as they want to promote the appearance of caring about their people. Rather than making appropriate resources and data available to their engineers, they insert extra levels of management that will not understand what you do, what you have contributed in the past, and what you can contribute to the company's future and bottom line. They firmly believe the fount of all managerial wisdom can be found in California alone, and indeed, built an altar to their beliefs there in order to not force their guru and his minions to relocate to Boise. The incredible disconnect between management decisions based on Silicon Valley dynamics and labor pool translate very poorly in an environment where quality of life is still important. California-based managers deliberately reduced all employees to numbers, forced a bell curve assessment model of performance that falsely changed employee rankings, subsequently depriving many not out of just their deserved bonuses, but their very jobs. These rankings were not based on actual performance, but on manipulated numbers highly influenced by politics. In an interesting note: managers were somehow exempt from this ranking system and its consequences, and a curiously large percentage of terminated employees were either older, higher paid, or both.This incredibly misjudged practice has resulted in many valuable employees finding themselves out on the street; many others rejected the management by fear techniques and moved on to greener pastures. Further exacerbating the problem, they have chosen to target still more older, experienced, coincidentally higher paid employees by trying to get them to take a feeble ""early retirement"" package. It's pretty obvious at this point that catchy ""employees matter"" slogans cannot hide the fact that they actually don't.
2. If you love having to produce a gourmet meal out of ice cubes and mint leaves, you have come to the right place. Micron has taken austerity measures to a new low, leaving folks scrambling for resources and expected to make decisions by the seat of their pants. Indeed, when the problems are brought up, you are rewarded with more micromanagement and fewer resources. Good luck with that.
3. Lots of employee polls have been taken to see why people are unhappy. Clearly no one actually reads them, or management would not be so mystified. Perhaps employees have figured out that these ""anonymous"" questionnaires aren't so ""anonymous"" and can be traced back to them. Perhaps they expect to be told, again, ""If you don't like it, LEAVE!"" And yet management in California is flummoxed by the number of high quality people...leaving.
4. Micron is Big Brother these days. Your every move is tracked, 500 of your best buddies are thrown into a loud ""bullpen"" where everyone knows your business, my business, and what their neighbor ate for breakfast. Even better: you are expected to partake of this invasive and utterly chaotic atmosphere 50-60+ hours a week. Hope you are an extrovert!
5. If you are still reading this, you are a glutton for punishment. The amount of time you are expected to work definitely takes a toll on employees and their families. Good thing Micron has such excellent insurance and you can all get counseling...well, the employee can get counseling. Better have a good divorce attorney on retainer, though, because marriage counseling isn't covered! Is this hard on your relationship with your kids? Too bad, family counseling isn't covered, either. Better sock away extra money to buy their love.
6. You had better always agree with whatever ignorant nonsense your boss spouts. If you don't, you are a target in those employee bell-curve rankings. Even better is the fact that if you have any problems with your boss, you can't expect help from their boss...and you can't try to change to another department, because then you are disloyal. Suck it up, Buttercup, and brown nose as though your job depends on it, because it does.
7. If you loved school lunches as a child, brace yourself: lunches at Micron will not meet your exacting standards and will cost an order of magnitude greater than what they are worth. Take heart, though, for the fine establishments frequented by Ronald McDonald and the Burger King are nearby and provide far more quality fare.
8. But wait! There's more! Your 60 hour workweek includes 40 hours of meetings every week, many of which run late into the evening because the engineers in Singapore don't want to get up early but are sure you love to stay late for the pleasure of their wisdom. Surely your job is secure and would never move offshore...
9. Last, but not least, is the employee exercise program, where you are expected to hike two miles a day, come rain, sleet, Snowmageddon, or the blistering sun, just to get into your building and back to where you parked your car. After all, adequate parking costs money that is needed for management bonuses.
10. Okay, so #9 wasn't the last one. When you give notice, Micron walks you off the premises like a mother in law who overstayed her welcome. You may or may not receive your paycheck within the time frame proscribed by law, and your exit interview will include much lamenting by HR that they hear everything that is wrong from each employee who leaves but are truly powerless to change things, because the fount of all wisdom in California does not care. 

Summary: The culture is toxic, the work environment hostile, and management is distant and incapable of learning from mistakes. If you take a job at Micron, travel light and keep your resume updated.
Advice to Management
1. Learn to read. Employees actually say a lot on those questionnaires. 
2. Boise is not California. Learn that so you stop expecting what ""works"" in California to ""work"" here.
3. Management by fear isn't management, it's just hostile. Self respecting folks will leave. As you have seen, over and over and over....
4. Good employees can always find jobs at another, similar even, company who actually treats them with respect and values their knowledge and experience. Don't wait until people leave to recognize their importance to your success.
5. Stop telling people who are unhappy to leave. The good ones will.
6. Remember that some people, no matter what management wants to comfort itself by saying, are simply irreplaceable. Treat them as valuable individuals instead of nameless drones.
7. Ditch the rank and yank while you still have employees to evaluate.

Upper management tries to make the company like a silicon valley employee but really does not care about employees or making them feel happy. Asking employees to post positive reviews to change the companies rating on sites like this is not moral or honest.

2019-06-15,,,Current Employee,Inconsistent leadership at director/VP Level and almost total lack of women in executive leadership positions,"Micron has survived as number 2/3 memory company after Samsung/Hynix and is a US success story. Proud to be a part of that. 

Pay is decent but would like to see full transparency for male to female comparisons. 

The Boise team members in general are very dedicated and go out of their way to be helpful. 

The recent trend with more flexible working hours and location is convenient. 

Some of the changes that have taken place with Sanjay have been progressive and good for Micron.
",".
 All recent management hires I think except one have been VPs from Sandisc or Western Digital who are from India and male.

The diversity and inclusion they advertise is more on the surface and club like, it doesn’t mean there is a program to even out women in the higher level leadership positions or even identify those who would like to be. The good ole boys club is still in force unfortunately. It’s just a different nationality now. 

There is still dedicated mid level senior managers talent at Micron excited about many of the new changes but not empowered while directors and above are just frankly not managing their teams. 

This is a global company. Most jobs may require working evenings as we have Asia manufacturing sites. Be prepared. It’s expected. The unexpected part is that the organizations do not have process for justifying new headcount and many organizations run too lean. If that is the case you either have no work life balance because your work load is too much or you feel bad because you can never do as much as you would like to do. 

Top senior talent is leaving and the current leadership does not seem to have any concerns and in fact is creating policies that encourage that. The hiring strategy is one dimensional and seems short sighted to only hire new grads. But as we lose the senior level experience, who will train these new grads and how many excursions will Micron accept due to lack of senior talent and so many in training?

Rating system is not owned by direct supervisor ,thus throughout the calibration process, your number may change. This is frustrating and demoralizing to the team member and their manager.
Advice to Management
Develop a more balanced strategy for hiring that limits Sandisk applicants; limits male applicants when there is a certain male to female ratio that is fully exceeded ; identifies women who desire and are prepared for the next promotional step and helps prepare a path so that the equality of male to female leadership starts to work at Micron

Develop a corporate process for justifying headcount when needed by quantifying the benefit and the resource constraint. 

Empower your leaders to make decisions and be responsible for their teams. Introduce servant leadership. Consider a more modern performance system. Ranking is an older method that many companies have abandoned. It fosters mistrust and kills collaboration in the team. 

Develop a system for evaluating Directors and VPs. These very highly paid individuals should be the best leaders and managers. Let their team evaluate them.

Advice to Management
Change is good. Gaining efficiency is critical to a company's continued growth and success. However, it is vital to ensure that change is managed properly. This means ensuring new programs are fully tested and vetted to ensure all downstream impacts have been identified and mitigated prior to final execution; and that all areas impacted by the change are represented in the testing phase to enable the most seamless transition possible. This also means communicating better to all team members impacted by the change, and ensuring they have the necessary tools or training to meet and exceed new expectations.

2019-06-14, Senior Manager,"Boise, ID","Current Employee, more than 10 years","I love our company, I think you would too","The people. One thing you will find is that the vast majority (there will always be naysayers/pessimists) is that we are all rowing in the same direction. We are working together and making our business better. I know I can go to my peers, team, or other teams for assistance and support and it won't be a challenge or fight. Instead we will work to solve the problem or issue and do so together. 

The work, we are not a sexy company in name recognition. However the work we do and the products we provide are critical to the technical innovation that happens every day on every continent. Without Micron's products the world would not be as technologically advanced as it is. We come to work knowing that what we do and accomplish enable the innovation of those working to make the world more accessible, cure previously incurable illnesses, solve problems thought to be impossible. It really is amazing to know we are a critical part of that.

Lastly corporate responsibility. Micron is a global leader when it comes to corporate social responsibility. Whether it is from ethical sourcing, recycling, community engagement, charitable giving, human rights and treatment, and any other number of topics I know Micron is committed to being the best corporate citizen it can and it truly encourages us as team members to be the same.
","We are a global company, this means long days, nights, mornings, etc... as we work to collaborate with our peers, suppliers, customers around the world. We have, over the past 2 years, have seen a genuine emphasis on improving our work-life balance (2-3 years ago I would have rated this a 1). However, the realities of being multinational will require flexibility in your work schedule. The great news is we as leaders are understanding and supportive of modified work schedules. The downside is that this will never be fully mitigated so if you are considering a career here, you should be aware that you may have days that start early, go late, or both to enable the effective collaboration of our global organization so don't be surprised by it. It can be difficult and challenging but it is getting better. I just never expect work-life balance to be our greatest strength.

","You cannot survive in a company which rates you against your co-workers and supports a forced bell curve distribution(rank and yank system). It causes unnecessary tension between teams, lack of cooperation and people are always fighting for attention. Due to the complexity of semiconductor industry, fresh grads take atleast a year to figure out the workings of the job and they are rated poorly just when they are have started to grow into their roles. This is illogical and unnecessary, new hires are forced to leave. People play favorites all the time and everything the management decides including ratings is too much of a blackbox. Everyone works too much and too long,there is no work life balance, everyone is always on-call. Not much potential for growth. THERE IS ALWAYS A CHANCE OF LAYOFFS. They also implemented a Mandatory time off policy for 2 quarters so far (6 days per quarter). This causes international employees to unnecessarily use hard earned time off which they are trying to save for a visit back home. This policy is very harsh and rigid. If you want to treat employees badly, why pretend you care at all?
Advice to Management
Give people time and resources to learn and grow (encourage collaboration) . Encourage proper documentation of resources as that is needed by every team (a forced ranking sytem does not encourage people to document their knowledge or to help other new employees suceed) . Why force a ranking system when all employees are working really hard at almost the same level? If you want to layoff, do so without pretending that some people are not 'meeting expectations'. Truly encourage ideas by all level employees, not just to pretend. Clearly define goals and rating calculation to employees. Managers should check in weekly with new employees and try to help them grow into their roles.

The people make the company. Dedicated, good, smart people work here. They work a lot of hours and put a lot of their life to make this company successful. Work colleagues become your family and we support each other through thick and thin.
","New executive and senior level management teams have resulted in a lot of change in our culture which is both good and bad. New ideas and experience are being brought to Micron (good) but not a lot of internal promotion is taking place at the senior management levels (bad.) Much needed building /work place updates have been made (good) but questionable spending on the design/fixtures and implementation (and re-implementation) when a simple refresh would have done the job (bad.) 

Decision making is either not done at the right level of the organization, or, decisions aren't being made at all, leaving groups spinning in circles providing data multiple times over just in a different format to help management make a decision.

Over the past couple of years Micron has used a forced distribution curve for performance ratings which has impacted the psychological safety one should feel while at work. This has changed/is changing aspects of our culture including collaboration (people are starting to only look out for their best interest) and transparency (people are afraid to share items for fear it will be held against them later.)

Also does not make sense to still ask to managers to still rate their employees with 1 or 2 even after months of performance 1:1s every 2 weeks. Isn't the whole point of being a manager is to help the employees succeed? Even after months of working with the employee, managers are still asked to rate 1 or 2.
Advice to Management
Do away with the forced rating just to meet a bell curve. Managers can gauge whether employees are indeed not performing and don't need to be forced to meet the bell curve. You need to trust that your mid-level managers know their employees' performance well. Also, forcing employees to consume leaves while hiring senior management from the outside (with most likely very high compensation) does not sit well for most people.

flexible hours of working
Good paid off time
","First of all, it really depends on what team you are in and also what the job role (manager/engineer/technician or operator ) is.
I would like to mention two areas that Micron needs to work on:
1) management: My previous manager was super busy that barely had time for me. Even for my most critical needs in my career path he didn't support me. What is more important than the people building your team? isn't people one of Micron core values?? Because that manager I moved to another team, the new manager is caring and supporting. 
Second: immigration: when I joined Micron they applied for a green card after two years while other bay area tech companies usually apply for green card right after you joined or within the first few months. It seems now the apply soon. But they have outsourced the immigration support to a external company which doesn't seem doing very good. Plus, Micron usually apply for EB3 even though you have an advanced degree (master's/PhD), which makes a difference in a waiting time for green card.
Advice to Management
You need to improve your immigration support and teach your managers to value, support and spend time for the people working for them

2019-06-12, Engineer,"Manassas, VA","Current Employee, more than 1 year",Very poor work/life balance,"The processes are interesting and should intrigue any engineer.
","The work/life balance is terrible. Almost everyone shows up earlier to work than expected and almost no one leaves on time at the end of the day. You almost feel guilty for actually trying to follow your scheduled work hours since everyone else is working extra. 

A big part of this is not staffing enough technicians and not training people well enough after they get hired. This makes engineers do the technicians job in addition to their engineering duties which can be time consuming and stressful in my opinion. As for the training issue, it appears they rely on experienced individuals from other semiconductor companies to make up for the fact that they cannot grow and develop their own people.
Advice to Management
Talk to your employees and be approachable. I have only ever heard a few words from my area manager and never heard a word from my department’s director. Talk to employees instead of only other managers to get an idea of what is actually going on. 

If that doesn’t work, then just look around the office at the end of the day and question why no one is leaving on time.

","The company is putting forth an enormous effort to force a culture change that does not match the region. Different countries and cultures have different approaches/attitudes towards work and their workplace. What is successful in one part of the world does not necessarily work in another.

Employee concerns are filtered, if not completely blocked before they reach a level of management that could have an effect. Your voice will not be heard. The upper management has a plan and is not concerned how you feel about it.
Advice to Management
Listen to your employees. We’re humans, not automatons.

Blind focus on efficiency improvements while ignoring the real need for staffing will result in burned out employees due to work overload.
Changing policy to require a college degree even for entry level tech positions will eliminate an enormous pool of highly skilled, experienced, and motivated former military and industrial workers that would otherwise be a welcome and necessary addition to the company.
Stop wasting millions of dollars on a new office layout that was soundly rejected by the affected employees when they were surveyed on the design a couple years ago.

2019-06-12, Manufacturing Process Engineer,"Boise, ID","Current Employee, more than 5 years",Female Engineer in Technology Development Department with BS education level,"Pay is good for Boise area since cost of living is generally lower than many other metro areas. I have seen a steady increase in salary over the past several years that has outpaced the cost of living increases of the area and reflected pretty accurately on my performance. 
I have experienced a broad degree of autonomy on my projects and my managers give me lots of flexibility in determining how to execute tasks the way I think is best. Very little micromanaging in my experience. 
The work atmosphere is relatively low stress for how busy everyone is. I don't feel like there is ever anger or animosity between people even when things get crazy and stressful.
Opportunities for career advancement are pretty good right now (we'll see if they tighten education vs experience requirements more) but require self initiation. 
Boise area is nice if you like being outdoors and outdoor activities. The city is very clean, safe, and family friendly with lots of community parks. 
Depending on where you live, the commute to work can be just a few minutes. A number of people ride bikes to work.
","In the Technology Development department the % of women is still very low (~5% in my area but generally higher 10-15% in other areas) but has improved significantly in the past few years.
The new TD office building is pretty nice and modernly styled. The other office buildings are undergoing renovations but movement on this has been slow so office/cube accommodations are fine but not as nice as other big tech companies.
Career development training was very lacking in the past but is getting better and allowing more mobility. 
Very little public transportation in Boise although the city is getting better with Van Pools and drivers are generally considerate of bikers who obey good riding sense.

New leadership is so focused on the stock price and not the employees. Spending $10 billion on buying back stock (legal stock price manipulation) while taking away training, travel, and the ability to hire good people. I would rather they lay us all off than to perpetuate this slow bleed - it’s dehumanizing. Although if they laid us all off they’d have to report it and it would hurt the stock price. I never understood what burnout meant...until now.

","The worst thing is the silos!! When you rate a group of people and force a bell curve and cut the low performers you get everyone fighting each other for a better rating instead of promoting collaboration. Not much changes either, things get rolled out that are supposed to make things better but it feels as though they dont actually consult the people that work here and go off what is done at other companies. Things go good for a bit then they just revert to doing things the way they always do. Work life balance is also really bad, it feels like we work harder with less. Back filing positions dont happen very often so if you are short on your team expect to work more to pick up the slack. If you do work harder, expect promotion or talks of a raise only once a year on a cycle (if the company is doing good enough) otherwise you keep working hard without increase. Recognition is also hard to come by unless management is reminded to give praise. If you are looking for best in class company they are not it but for a mid tier tech company they are good. Unless you are from a top tier school, they mostly hire from within so getting in is difficult.
Advice to Management
If you want to be a true top tier company you need to update with the times and consult your working class on what needs to be done.

-More acceptable to American culture (being a global company and all)
-","ant training 
-Most data and records are available to most employees, which makes it easier to look up the things you want
Cons
-Really long hours
-Sub-par data/computer systems. You'll spend a good chunk of your time waiting for things to load
-Sometimes you won't get the necessary tools for you to complete your work. (cost saving and such) I had to wait for a month to apply for a headset for online meetings due to cost reduction, and applying for a second monitor is just as hard if not harder. 
-Still has some Taiwanese working culture in the office (for those who's not accustomed to it)
-Food isn't great
-Only managers and special personnel have laptops, which makes it really inefficient for regular employees
-The overall atmosphere in the workplace is just kind of stuffy and depressed (some departments more so than others)

Be smart with our money! It is discouraging to see us move from high dollar real estate in San Jose just a few years ago to save money, only to move back as soon as we make a little money. Purchasing a new executive Jet looks foolish right now as well. I realize executives are already set for life and will move on soon, but the rest of us want to see Micron around for another 20 years.

We have seen a change in culture and focus. I like the direction we are heading. I feel our executives truly care about their employees. We have transparency with leadership team, great culture, programs that enable professional development and advancement. Co-workers are friendly. Biggest thing for me is that I feel like the work I do makes a positive difference to people and to the world in general.
","Making a lot of progress, but still a lot of work to do with diversity and inclusion, especially in the area of women in leadership roles.
Other con is that decisions are not always made at the appropriate levels, still work to do with empowering lower level managers and team members to make decisions.

My only advice is that we look how decisions are made and figure out how to reduce unnecessary red tape. 

Thank you Sanjay and executive leaders for putting us on the right track for a successful future. Go Micron!

","There has been a push in the last 2 years around making Micron the best company to work for. Unfortunately, this is truly about the numbers and not the people. Staked ranking systems, being pushed to work like Silicon Valley but not giving Silicon Valley pay, and leadership driving team members to breaking points by pushing more and more initiatives on extremely short timelines. 
The diverse workforce has a ways to go with women in top leadership roles still lacking. The CEO talks of having women in those roles yet he has not hired a single woman VP to report to him. The only woman that does, was here before he arrived. 
The culture has gotten so bad that many of the smartest and most loyal team members are leaving in alarmingly large numbers. 
The reviews are getting so bad that we are being asked by leadership to go onto social media and say good things to try to bring up our numbers.
Advice to Management
Stop pretending to be a people culture 
Just own being a company that is solely driven by the numbers. Portraying an image that is not accurate is worse than just being what we are, A company that makes great memory and is becoming very competitive in the market. And that is okay but Micron is NOT a company of the people and I want to personally apologize to anyone I recommended to work here.

Listen to your customers and your employees, and base all of your business decisions on how to improve the company's relationship with customers and team members. Profitability, reputation, and market differentiation will naturally follow.

A lot of the equipment techs are ex-military which makes a lot of them dedicated to the job and very chill to work with. Company engagement is a big thing here, everyone contributes to making the company better; above just doing your job. 
I've worked at many places and this has to be hands down my favorite. The culture and values I learned during orientation really brought everything home this company is incredible.
","No real downside. I'm really looking forward to Micron taking over since it will open up the opportunity to transfer to other sites if a position I'm interested in becomes available.
Advice to Management
Try to keep everything that made IM Flash great when we become Micron. Change is scary but I'm really hopeful for all the great possibilities with Micron.

","Management is inept and full of backstabbers and liars. Don't expect any guidance on elevating your career at Micron. You'll be too busy trying to hit unreasonable schedules created by other people who don't have to do the work.

Yearly ""performance reviews"" are a joke. You're given a silly 1-5 rating by a manager who doesn't know what you do, and who checks in once a year.

No work/life balance due to all of the above. Routine is 60 hrs/wk. Unreasonable vacation policy that is not competitive.

SanDisk takeover has made the working environment toxic. Micron is off shoring jobs as fast as possible. As a result, the best people have already left for other opportunities.

Management by fear and intimidation. There are video cameras watching your every move. Managers monitor your key-card entry comings and goings. Managers actively monitor how long you're at your terminal, and how long (in seconds) it's been since your mouse has moved.

Keeping a lean workforce is good business sense, but you have to take in account of the obvious drawback of employees unable to cope with the heavy workload during times of unexpected machine issues. A lean workforce isn't completely without its cons.

Sometimes, new business processes or IT platforms arn't necessarily an improvement - just because you want to have a ""WIN"" in your weekly for the sake of showing innovation, productivity may actually be in fact reduced. But I guess that doesn't matter as long as your weekly looks good to your boss, I guess?

2019-03-06, Senior Manager,"Boise, ID","Current Employee, more than 10 years",Wouldn't recommend unless you have no other options,"- The pay is about average for the industry, which translates into good compensation if you're in a low cost area like Boise. If you're in a high-cost area, the salaries aren't as competitive.
- There are some truly good people working hard in the trenches to make a difference. These front-line folks keep the business running. Can't say the same for most of the upper management team.
- In good years, the bonus structure is fairly generous (although it's a pittance compared to the $1 Million+ productivity per worker the company has been able to achieve) 
- There is some flexibility in work environment, with things like work-from-home becoming more common.
- Benefits are fairly good, but would it could do with a much improved dental plan, a sabbatical program, and job swapping programs to give team members more visibility to other areas of the company.
- Some management chains are superb, and I'm fortunate to work in one of those organizations. Unfortunately, these are rare at Micron.
","1. Micron is turning into Sandisk v. 2.0. There have been few internal promotions to executive levels since Sanjay took over, with most new blood coming from Sandisk and almost all are are non-American and have no clue about the culture in places like Idaho, Utah or Virginia; that culture is what made Micron a success and they're killing it.
2. The executive team (the C-Suite execs in particular) are COMPLETELY disconnected from the operations of the company, seem unaware of the low morale they've created with the focus on their own wallets and power structures, and present a garbled, disjointed ""values"" system that is more marketing than a realistic plan to improve the soul of the company. For example, they espouse the value ""we care about our people"" while at the same time kicking team members out the back door.
3. The new performance management scheme is a thinly veiled attempt to lay-off 10-15% of American workers every year for the next 5-7 years. While unspoken, it's become apparent that Sanjay and his team have no respect for American workers. Each year, 10-15% of workers will receive a failing performance grade, and while there's an alleged path to redemption, in actuality it's nearly impossible for those workers to meet the arbitrary and unrealistic expectations defined in their ""performance improvement plan"". And since everyone is graded on a bell curve, every year another group of workers will fall into the failing category and be fired. This rank-and-yank system has been shown over and over in studies dating back to the 1980's that it lowers morale, turns the job into a popularity contest, lowers efficiency, and just doesn't work. The fact that it's in use in 2019 shows a level of incompetence and ignorance from the executive team, and doesn't engender a lot of trust among the hard working team members who make them successful. I personally know of dozens of highly skilled workers who are no longer with the company because of this scheme. 
4. Continuing from #3, it's obvious that Micron is trying to get away with performing layoffs without having to report that material information to the SEC, shareholders, and other stakeholders. It's a legal requirement in the U.S. that all workforce reductions above a certain percentage must be reported.
5. Expect to work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, including on vacations, holidays, while sick, etc. With all the terminations and resignations, and with no back-filling of those positions being allowed, each team is doing the same job with less and less labor. The inevitable result of this is going to be more failing performance evaluations and more firings. It's a vicious cycle that will see workers spending more and more hours on the job, never quite catching up to the work-load, being told they're failures, and morale will continue to decline. 
6. While you're expected to be on-call 24/7 and available by phone, remote connection or pager, the company doesn't provide equipment beyond a cheap 80's era pager with which to communicate (and even that's only 1 way communication). With 10+ billion in profit last year, the least the company could do is provide cheap smart phones for all team members who are expected to act 24/7 in the case of an emergency.
7. The CEO is using the tax breaks provided in the new 2017 tax law to make $10B in stock buybacks. Even as market conditions deteriorate, the exec team is stubbornly sticking to the buyback plan. This goes completely against the alleged ""progressive"" values the company purports to support.
8. Expect to have your ""priorities"" shifted on a regular basis, often while in the middle of a project that was top priority just 2 weeks ago. The company's strategic planning is non-existent, and often happens after the action period has already started. For example, it's March 2019, 6 months into the fiscal year, and upper management is still deciding how to execute on the (non-existent) strategic plan for the year. Also, everything is a top priority, which means nothing is really a priority, and this contributes to low morale and indecisiveness by team members and their departments.
9. Departments often have objectives that conflict with other departments, and often those conflicts are resolved by whichever VP can yell the loudest or who knows the most powerful C-Suite exec. I've been in meetings where I spent an hour listening to VP's and Directors scream and cuss at each other, and I've even seen several people threatening violence. Those people are still with the company and leads to my next point:
10. Many upper management and executive level leaders use a management style reminiscent of 1980's era thinking. Management by fear. Management by negativity. Management by impossible expectations. Management by dictate. Management by enforced cutthroat competitions among team members.
11. The company is slowly shifting American workers to India - expect to train your replacement if your department is one of those being off-shored.
12. The environment for a regular cubicle worker is terrible. The lighting is bad, people are packed in like sardines, the decor is drab, there's very little natural light, and overall it doesn't contribute to happy, healthy and productive workers.
13. The mental health of a lot of workers is extremely compromised. Combine a poor physical work environment with cutthroat survival competitions, shifting priorities, opaque direction from the executive team, the fear of dropping into the bottom 15%, the hostility from management towards mid-management and front-line team members, and their are a lot of people in a really bad place mentally and emotionally. The company has offered mental health services to team members, but it's attacking the symptoms without touching the underlying root problems.
Advice to Management
1. Kill the rank-and-yank system and be transparent about the change, with an acknowledgement that it was a mistake and the company will do better to protect its workers.
2. Either change the way the COO operates or remove him from the company. He's managed to drive away a lot of really good talent, and is a cancer on morale. His strategies are old-school and don't work, and he's a shameless promoter of moving jobs, IP, and mind-share to India.
3. Move the senior executive team back to Boise. If they don't want to live in Boise, then they're probably not a good fit for Micron. Boise isn't Silicon Valley and they shouldn't try to turn Micron into a SV company.
4. Stop the meetings. It's not uncommon to have 15 or 20 meetings in a day, with many time slots double or triple booked. The meetings accomplish almost nothing, and require the attendees to do their real job after hours, early in the morning or on the weekends. Put a stop to the 4 AM, 9 PM, and Saturday meetings. We spend so much time accommodating Asian time schedules that it's killing American workers productivity and morale. 
5. Enact a policy that every worker has 4 hours every week/month (say on a Friday afternoon) to work on whatever project they want, as long as it benefits the company. This encourages innovation and allows every worker to contribute to something beyond their day job. This would improve morale.
6. Don't just publish the company values - live them. I don't see a lot beyond lip service.
7. For the executives - start getting face-to-face with your team members. Not in a top down thou-shalt-do-this type of all hands meetings. Actually spend some time with your teams to see what they do, what their pain points are, and how YOU can help with the challenges they face on a day to day basis. Visit as a listener rather than as someone who's just dictating demands.
8. Provide better, more transparent ways to allow feedback for team members on senior executives. That I have to use Glassdoor to point out the problems with the executive team is absurd. The company is not going in a good direction and there's no good place to provide feedback for the average worker where they can feel safe to be honest and open about the challenges they face.

The campaign for work-life balance is just paying lip service. Poor work-life balance.

When Micron's 2018 revenue exceeds 30 billion USD, spending 3-4k per person to train your team on critical skills is a good investment that will make work much easier down the road. 

Think long term and don't be so calculative when something doesn't generate returns in, say, a week. Have respect for people with technical skills. They are not so easily acquired and should be treasured.

2019-02-25, Senior Engineer,"Manassas, VA","Former Employee, more than 10 years",Micron Manassas experience,"Micron Manassas used to be a good company and so the one star is meant for the last 2 years or so. I stayed there from 2005-2018, working on various roles from shift engineering, process, integration, quality with some reassignments at Boise, ID and Singapore ... my good experiences are summarized as follows:
- good location for single individuals or young families. Manassas in general have the worst schools and crime in the area but the adjacent 'Linton Hall' and Fairfax districts have some of the best schools.
- Proximity to Washington DC (less than an hour's drive by car). Its like living close to Paris or Rome if you were to ask me. Close to Shenandoah State Park (again, less than an hour's drive). Northern VA is good if you are into Civil War history. Drive up and down and you'll be in Pennsylvania (Amish, Gettsyburg), Maryland (National Aquarium, NASA), North Carolina (Duke Univ, beaches)... Manhattan/NYC is 6 hours' drive up north.
- peers are generally nice, helpful and work really hard. 
- they send you to vendor training and will pay for your schooling as long as it fits your job role.
- they support green card applications for foreign workers.
- generous time off hours accumulation but whether or not they will approve your leave is another question.
-good 401k match at 6%. Need 4 yrs to vest.
- good training program like process classes, statistics. mentoring culture is terrible and likely non-existent in most groups.
","- salary is low if you would factor in the cost of living in the area. Northern VA is one of the most expensive in the US. $140,000/yr wont get you even a townhouse, which starts at $400,000. HOA's are another $250/mo. Of course there are cheaper options but pretty much you wont like it (1950's old brick houses in unsafe neighborhoods).
- management will tell everything to motivate you but deliver way short after you did your part of the bargain. they say do this and that and we'll get you promoted ... after exceeding the requirements and after a few months later you are still engineer 1. Boss will say that you are 'almost there' except for 1-2 things you need to improve on ... then you get a fresh to do list and the cycle continues. There's an unwritten expectation of working 55 hours or so minimum if you want to be 'good in their eyes'.
- promotion is not based on your performance alone. it is also based on how well you get the senior managers to like you. salesmanship and impression management will get you further than tangible accomplishment. quiet type engineers are at a disadvantage.
- work-life balance does not exist unless you work on 3-4 day shift. it is pretty common for non-shift people to work 55-60 hours a week. If you have a meeting at 7-8pm, you still need to show up at 7:45 am the following day. You are required to be contactable even in the middle of the night, and you are expected to work at home thru remote PC connection - and this is not counted as 'work hours'.
-yearly evaluations are based on how good you are compared to your peers ... you will be ranked against others. this made not a few people become selfish of how they do their work so as to be ranked better than others. if you are new, good luck figuring the ropes out.
- cyclical layoffs. I survived 3-4 layoffs so far and this means more work for the remaining workforce. Everybody is overworked, resulting in consistent attrition of workers. Most of who stayed are either foreign workers waiting for their permanent residency, older 50+ workers, or rank and file operators and technicians.
- most first level managers are chinese or indian so chances are youll have an asian boss (again due to permanent residency issue, they have no choice but to stay). this would translate into a more asian style 'sweatshop' approach to management than the more liberal 'consensus based' american style we love. favoritism also play well at times in getting hot jobs i.e. expat assignments.
- cafeteria food is terrible, not to mention the cubes are 1980's style light blue cloth with light brown steel frame and light gray cabinets. computers are slow but they change it every 6 years. i went to some offsite training before and i was handed over an old heavy laptop and corded mouse for use. i volunteered to use mine instead and just accessed my work PC remotely. 
- Parking is insufficient. Need to come early to secure a good spot.
- No gym.

Bottomline: workers are not well taken cared of based on their treatment and their general workplace. A lot have already left and moved on.

Opportunities for advancement and salary adjustment can vary by department
Advice to Management
Value all of your employees. Have high expectations, and make it easy for leadership to either help low performers or walk them, but give the leadership in the trenches the ability to make that call. Enforcing the percentage year over year will soon result in loss of talent we don't want to lose. Don't talk down to employees and treat changes made for business needs as if they are also for the good of the employee personally.

2) Not much training, everyone too busy working to their stuffs, just learn on the job

3) Management's planning is poor and sometimes unrealistic.

5) Increasing number of fire-fightings events and the directors just like to finger pointing rather than solving the issues. A lot of time wasting in meetings etc, rather than allowing the engineers work on things.

However, their credentials and performance have shown they got hired because of who they know rather than what they can do.

Good pay

The work-life balance is awesome. Since what you do doesn't matter and the project you work on will get cancelled anyway, you don't have to work long hours nor even work all that hard because you and your work don't matter.

The stock market is smoking hot right now so Micron is making lots of money, so the 6 month outlook is fantastic.
","The running joke from people who have left is that Micron is the only company you work at where you will have to take things OFF your resume.

Your skills will actually degrade at Micron and if you're not careful Micron's toxic culture will rub off on you.

I was there a long time and I was hoping having fresh executives out in California might dilute the toxic culture but I saw no evidence of any change. I think the cultural inertia is just too great.
Advice to Management
Stay at Micron. Please. Don't leave or you'll infect other companies. The management skills and styles you are picking up at Micron are not good. It's better for everyone else if you just stay at Micron.

It's funny to read the complaints from Boise people who think California executives is a good ole' boys club that is destroying the company. You do realize this is how the other remote sites look at Boise right? Perhaps Boise people just don't like it because they're suddenly not in the club.

Recognize your direct report's value and pair that with their performance when evaluating. Don't play favorites. As a manager, your decision on how you evaluate your employees should not be determined by your manager. ""If you have integrity, nothing else matters.

Especially the time-off, which is imperative for maintaining one's sanity at this place. Pay is lower than industry average, partly b/c of the lack of job market competition in the Boise area.
","Shift work by its nature is tedious, repetitive, and mind-numbing. Add to that the pain of rotating to night shifts every 4 months and the conditions for a soul-sapping corporate cog job are created. Indeed there are opportunities to move off of shift. But somehow being a process owner working 50-60 hours/week and being on-call 24/7 does not sound much better. The shift crews also have many stars and stripes good-old boy types that somehow gained the title of 'engineer' without a real engineering degree. If you wish to be surrounded by Trump supporters with myopic perspectives of the world, shift might be for you.

The work environment became hostile in Oct-Nov 2018 when the performance-based 'soft-layoffs' occurred. I performed well and benefitted, but many folks who performed equally as well were rated lower and paid the price; I cannot help but feel some level of guilt even if these things are beyond my control. The consequences of this rating system will eventually take its toll on this company. Some areas are even identifying and holding onto their '1s and 2s' now so they can ax them come performance review time. How on earth is this indicative of the 'tenacious' and 'people-based' culture that leadership continues to extoll? I think now is a good time to GTFO of Micron.

2019-01-28, R&D Engineer,"Boise, ID","Current Employee, more than 5 years",Race to the bottom,"1. Great technology portfolio. Few companies can match this.
2. Fantastic co-workers, some of the best engineers in the industry.
3. Nice work culture and work-life balance, at least in R&D (deteriorating rapidly).
4. Compensation base + bonus reasonably good for Idaho.
5. Relatively easy to move within the organization.
6. Good on-the-job training for NCGs and Interns.
","1. The location. Let's be honest, Boise is not the most fun place on this planet. The city is inexpensive, and there is a very good reason why.
2. Quite a few teams are understaffed. Add to that, an extreme lack of co-ordination between different teams and tonnes of pointless meetings. 
3. Cafetaria. The options are limited and mediocre at best. Virtually nothing for vegetarians. And there are no restaurants in a 5 mile radius which makes things worse.
4. Really slow, tedious and erratic promotion process by industry standards.
5. Continuous shuffles and re-shuffles making life miserable for the engineers. Rolling around like headless chicken rarely help.
6. The new 'rank and yank' system based on PPA which was introduced last year. Scores of really good engineers were kicked out due to this approach, at a time when Micron is one of the most profitable companies in the world (3B+ operating income per quarter, for past 6 quarters). It seems most managers were not in favor of this, but leaders in this company are not really renowned for their fortitude. So, no one took the fight to the upper management. And we are all paying the price now. It has been barely 3 weeks since NYE, and already 10+ engineers resigned and left. And with Intel, YTMC and WD recruiters on the prowl for Micron talent, this is all set to get worse in the coming months. It is just unbelievably frustrating that the engineers who are some of the finest and developing some of the most complex technologies in the world need to go through this pain.
Advice to Management
Micron is not a company and Boise is not a location for which engineers are willing to put their career and livelihood on the line. You cannot treat your employees like Amazon and pay them like ON semiconductor. That just doesn't work. Things need to improve fast and this new PPA approach needs to go. And these changes once made need to be clearly and categorically communicated to the TMs. If there is a repeat of this fiasco this year end, it is quite likely there won't be any NVM engineers left to lay-off in 2020.

 If you work shift work you will have to work nights every 4 months which can get pretty hard on the body especially if you are constantly rotating back to a day schedule on your days off. If you work M-F 8 to 5pm you will most likely because a slave to your job with little to no flexibility in your schedule. You will also spend at least 50% of your day in useless meeting where 90% of the people in the meeting are just starting at their laptop. When you finally get some work done just make sure not to mess up because you will never hear something like ""good job"" or ""nice work today"". You will only hear something when you mess up and they are telling you. Also, do expect to move up in company unless you have a friend in high places because this is one of the most bias places I have ever worked. On paper everything looks good and legal to HR but behind the sense they pull some shading stuff. Overall, just know that nepotism is high and moral is low.

","Forced bell curve distribution rating system. Senior management forces a 15% distribution of 1's and 2's and every group must adhere to this distribution. 1's and 2's are then managed out. Most 1's and 2's actually meet the rubric for a 3 but because of the forced distribution, lower managers must let people go. This has put morale at an all time low.
Team members no longer have careers but jobs. Don't buy a house, best rent if you plan on taking a job here.
Advice to Management
Work/life balance? The possibility of needing to sell your house, pack your things, pull your kids from school, pack up your parents and find a new job , all hanging over your head all the time can really bring a person down and affect their work.

2019-01-08, Project Manager,"Boise, ID","Current Employee, more than 3 years",The culture is changing,"Let me start by saying I love the work I do every day. It’s fun, exciting, challenging, co workers are great, etc.. If it wasn’t for my management structure, my team and I could be significantly more productive and my outlook would be completely flipped.
","Unfortunately over the last few years, things are changing. Managers and senior management are leaving left and right. Their replacements are often quick placement instead of correct placement if they are even replaced. There is a lot of leadership talent in non- manager rolls begging for the opportunity to prove they cane do the task, but are never afforded the opportunity. Instead, you end up with unqualified managers and with no leadership skills who are good at managing up, and terrible leading those below. This has lead to huge moral problems in the company. That along with review process where they force a bell curve which means you’re competing with everyone else in the company to just get a meets expectations. The curve is as follows, forced to each manager whether their team is 3 or 30 headcount: 
0-5%. - 1 and immediate termination
10% - 2 and performance improvement plan or separation package
60% -3 and you get to keep your job until the next culling
20% - 4 increased bonus (140%)
5% - 5 greater increased bonus (200%)

These will probably change before the end of FY19 but we won’t be informed until near the end of the fiscal year. Like in 2018 we were tolds 2s were safe, until you got a 2 and given a PIP impossible to meet (like obtain a college degree in 3 months).

It feels like we don’t matter anymore. We’re just another line item in some sheet. 

And forget getting raises! I have my PM title but I don’t even do PM work anymore. I’ve consumed roles from 3 other people who have left the company and haven’t made a penny more for th added time and effort. Having both early morning 5:30am and late night 8:00pm meetings. I get a cost of living increase once a year, but due to increased insurance each year, my net increases are in the $40 a month range. 

Long story short, your happiness here can be directly related to the quality of your Manager. I’ve had amazing managers, 2 who left the company for other opportunities because they couldn’t handle their managers. One I lost due to a re-.org because my department had lost so many leaders in 6 months and the reporting structure got severely messed up. It still is messed up with poor communication and no leadership/direction.
Advice to Management
Reevaluate how you review your employees. Some people are failing because you keep dumping more work on them. They fall behind then they get fired. Look into why your employees are leaving. There are exit interviews, do you even look into why someone has decided to leave? If a high performing team with no churn loses 1/2 its employees after a new Manager is placed on the team, maybe look at the managers performance and not criticizing the team who are choosing to stay. They’re running with 1/2 the resources necessary just trying to keep their head above waters. Do your job so we can do ours.

Many smart, talented people work there
","Supposed innovative company introduces antiquated performance management process midway through the year. Performance is judged by politics and many good people are driven out while very poor or mediocre people remain and advance. Upper level managers are either new and Sanjay clones (Mircon's idea of diversity is to hire Sanjay clones from ""top tier universities"") or old school Micron employees who have never worked anywhere else and lack perspective. As a result, management either knows too much (hubris) or not nearly enough. The culture is one of ""do what I say not what I do"" as they talk about valuing people and engagement and then sabotage all efforts with poor decision-making. In the last two months the end of year reviews were a kick in the mouth, followed by a request to ""kindly use all your vacation now."" Most people are unhappy and working for incompetent managers, but no one will say anything because it's a fear-based culture and there aren't many professional employment opportunities in Boise.
Advice to Management
Start walking your talk. Have some humility. Either get rid of People as a value or start to care about them. You can't create a soul-crushing environment and a great culture simultaneously, so choose one or the other and be honest about it.

","Performance evaluation is unfair. People say it's a bell curve. Well it's not. How could it be bell curve if the highest score you can get is 3. Then once something went wrong, you got 2 and let go. No matter how outstanding you perform, you'll get a three. The department requires that every team needs to give a 2 to somebody no matter how well people perform. What a sick rule! Hard working subject matter experts who worked their butt off and got real work done receive average score like everybody else. How will this motivate anybody?

Management has no interest in learning new technology and doesn't appreciate the innovation from their team. 

They used to hire brilliant people from top universities. Now newer folks mostly come from Boise State or some other unknown colleges in rural Idaho. Why bother getting the sharp kids when turnover rate is so high?

Absolutely no work-life balance. 

Working with technicians overseas is painful as heck as they have very minimal English fluency. Can't get anything done, but have to deal with it since Boise back end manufacturing was shut down.

2018-11-27, R&D Engineer,"Boise, ID","Current Employee, more than 3 years",R&D Engineer,"Boise is a small and pretty city.
","Summary:
Very poor work-life balance - Less paid off time after new CEO toke office - Seriously week technical Leads and Managers - Vey cheap culture - extremely less career development and growth opportunities - Too political 

Recent Measures:
• With new CEO, company turn over has increased hugely, and don't be too excited if you get an offer these days, as many kids are leaving. Ask for big pay, they have no choice, possibly they will accommodate you. 
• The new CEO has also came up with 7% layoff each year. If your manager wants to get rid of you, she/he will give you a low score, bing, you will need to go. Remember that there are no other opportunities in Boise other than Micron. For this reason, think really twice when you wana move to Idaho.

Career Opportunities:
• There are literally fewer opportunities to move up in the company. It's heavily depends on "" like-ability"" not on your experience and qualifications. Experience and good team members’ left/leaving the team after a Non-qualified team member was assigned as lead. Shocking ... I can see this behavior across the department. 

Compensations & Benefits:
• The pay is less than industry average. Often said Boise is a cheap city, however it's not as cheap as said at all. Recent migration from other states to Idaho has made the cost of living pretty high, housing is pricy; off course cheaper than Bay Area.
• The new CEO has cut the 6th month bonus from last year, though company has historic revenue last year.
• From this year, 4 of paid off days are removed from your flexible off time. The CEO office emailed us saying that “ to improve work-life balance”. Can you believe it?
• The new policy won’t allow you to accumulate your leave for long time, you are forced to use them, or they will expire. I have heard from our international kids that this policy is hurting them a lot as they need long leave to travel and visit their family abroad. 

Work/Life Balance:
• Though you may carry R&D title, work in here is 24/7, you get Paged almost every night. You are expected to reply Pages within 2 hours; otherwise your Manager will be Paged. The new CEO has came up with the idea of 12 months cadence, meaning product cycle is decreased from 24 month to 12 months, without increasing team members numbers.

Senior Management:
• You will be shocked to see how poor the technical Leads and Managers are. They don't understand the technical details of your work, so won't appreciate it.

Culture & Values:
• If you are from top 50 US universities, you will be very alone here. Kids here are from schools you haven't heard of, or some cases with no formal education. I came across a former bar tender that was teaching Engineer kids about a semiconductor tool.
• Company has a very poor and cheap culture. Engineers are treated like kids and often managers openly say that the main responsibility of an Engineer is to make lead/manager happy, that’s it, and you guess the rest. Since you are in Idaho, you are treated like you haven’t seen decent cities or never interacted with decent people. Recently we have couple of coffee machines installed across campus; we keep getting emails from managers on how great we are and how greatly we are celebrating our success. Dude, almost every village on this Planet has coffee machine.

CEO Approval
Business Outlook
Pros
Cost of living in the area
Cons
The company is driven to maximize the efficiency, yet it is very difficult to get anything done. The management is setting up people for constant resource and priority conflicts. The goal is clear to replace the individual contributor workforce every few years with the fresh and easier “manageable” people. Coming to Boise, make sure to plan your way out in few years as Micron is pretty much the only work option here. Managing-out practice is widely used across the company to either work people to the mental burnout or drive them out of the company.
Advice to Management
Be more open and transparent to people, eliminate favoritism when some employees happen to have easier access to resources and information. Help people with the continuous development, rather than use people to close the tactical gaps.

2018-11-18,Anonymous,"Boise, ID","Current Employee, more than 10 years",Engineer,"I've been at Micron for over 17 years. I've worked at several other companies prior to Micron. Every company has there good and bad, and, mostly I think Micron is good. Micron is a very diverse company, family oriented, with very decent benefits.
","The new CEO, Sanjay Mehrotra, has done some good, but, unfortunately the new system of forced bell curve ranking has changed my views of Micron. The last couple of years Micron has done very well and this year the bonus was probably the best I've ever seen. Yet, the recent layoffs using the forced bell curve ranking system have overshadowed the happiness that one should feel with Micron's success. 

I've seen and heard of terrible stories of good people getting low scores. Some of the scores were based on lies to help justify the low scores to remove individuals. Some stories of managers leaving Micron because they were being forced to give a low score when the individual didn't deserve it. 

Micron has had layoffs before and usually there is good justification for it. This last layoff, I have yet to understand the justification for it. Financially, this is the best that Micron has ever done. Sure, there are poor performers, they should be handled individually and appropriately.

Micron use of the forced bell curve ranking really doesn't make sense. It uses fear to increase performance, colleagues are now competing in the hope of keeping a high score and the collaboration goes down. You job is in question every year. If you do a google search for ""bell curve forced ranking"", you will find several articles stating that this method is outdated and doesn't increase performance and should not be used. 

It is for this reason I have hard time referring and recommending Micron to others. I really hope Micron re-evaluates this method.
Advice to Management
Ditch the forced bell curve ranking system. There are better ways to motivate and increase performance.

Advice to Management
Re-consider the downsides of the new performance review process. 

Consider this scenario: You have a highly successful group with several star performers, who must now be managed into a bell curve. 
This system will encourage those star performers to go elsewhere, because some arbitrary percentage of staff must be placed into a Performance improvement plan, which has the appearance (And effect) of being shown the door. 

I’ve seen very good engineers put on PIP, simply because ‘someone has to take the bullet’. I’m sure that’s not the intent from the top, but it is the reality of what happens on the ground. Smart people know this, and will go elsewhere. You do not want to lose your star performers.

Some co workers are friendly, helpful, and collaborative. Good pay, large operating budget. Very nice amenities, onsite coffee, refreshments, and food.
Cons
Often a very toxic work culture, where a “blame and shame” policy prevails. Work processes are not respected, politics and favoritism abound, and team members criticize others’ work to feel relevant. Fear is the primary motivator, as most TMs have been with the company so long they can’t afford a pay cut elsewhere.

","No feeling of job security, the current performance model demands 8% layoffs each and every year. Even if every employee excels someone will still need to go. Micron promotes employee contentment on one hand and slaps them around with the other. Not many employees are happy with this new model, supervisors are telling employees they are doing great at midyear reviews and then being forced to lower the review rating and offer the employee a severance package at years end. I have been told this comes directly from Sanjay and no one has the balls to tell him this is wrong. He believes that there is always room for improvement, which is true, but this is a drastic way of achieving that goal. He is attempting to instill performance through fear.

Everyday is a great learning opportunity. I always felt I was challenged enough to keep my motivation up. You get to work with very nice and smart people in interesting projects. Manassas site usually runs the legacy products but still you get to learn both DRAM, NAND and NOR technologies. Great benefits. Headquarter office works hard to improve work life balance with policies. Nice industry reputation.
","Manassas location has a very poor management. Goals are intentionly set higher than reasonable margins and managers are held accountable for not meeting those numbers. That pressure bubbles up while coming down to individual contributors. People are set for failure. For the last 18 months, the attrition rate was immensely high. Higher management covered up this problem by reporting to the corporate that lower performers were leaving the company. I personally know at least 15 incredible engineers left the company during that time. Some of them were the only ones who knew how the most critical equipments in photolithography area breaths in and out. That attrition impacted the plant operation which made the upper management even more fierceful. All of the mid- management is in survival mode to not to get in trouble with upper leadership and they don’t have any bravery to back up their direct reports. People are expected to work long hours. If they don’t, it impacts their performance review.
Advice to Management
Check the effectiveness of Manassas management. Conduct more frequent site visits and talk to the middle management. Do not rely on the personal relationship of the site leadership with the VP level leaders. Have some focus table discussions with individual contributors. Majority of the site is not happy, try to figure out why. Now that the site is expanding, you don’t want to lose the people you hire in 12 months. With the current environment, it is unfortunately inevitable. I still talk very highly about Micron. I had my best years at Micron in my career path. I was very sad to see the cultural shift in Manassas location. Take care of your people there, they deserve better than that. They should not be trapped under the ambition of senior leadership team

Comparing to other semiconductor companies in sg, Micron is the best in terms of benefits.
","Certain departments are seen as inferior despite the constant preaching of one Micron. Even the management feels the same which is not a fair view because every department has its fair share of capable employees. This leads to dissatisfaction. People lose the motivation to be at their best because once you are not part of the management’s good books/so-called star players (who are not spectacular imo), you won’t be promoted.

Management is self-serving. They just want the beautiful image/slides to present to the executives. As what another review wrote, it is more impt to look good than to be right. Chasing tails and data that is if no value.

Appraisal and employee’s surveys are done for show. Nothing would really change. 

In other companies, all employees, regardless of position levels are given the chance to travel to other sites. Here, only the management travels around. Some business travels are clearly not needed. 

Some departments get to have multiple team buildings per year while some barely had one.

Some promotions and hiring are highly doubtful. Hiring own people for political agendas when hiring could have been done in local sites for local positions. Some managers do not even have the necessary knowledge. Just pure leaching and pushing others for information.

Top heavy. Too many levels. EVP, SVP, VP, directors, 3 layers of managers. Talk about efficiency and cost savings.
Advice to Management
Clear HR policy/rules should be implemented when hiring. Transparency in hiring.

Management and executive should stop bringing in own clan. Hire based on merit.

Have a flatter organization. Remove the top, hire the operators. Rest assured that many issues would be solved.

","The semiconductor industry is a tough one. For the most part, do not ever expect to find reasonable work-life balance here. Messages at odd hours are rampant, as are expectations to be available out of work. The new leadership is tough, demanding, and expectations are high. Lots of departments struggle with high turn-overs. While collaborative teamwork is encouraged, obvious as a matter of business needs, there is some serious mismatch of expectations amongst different departments, and a tendency to misattribute tasks & actions to the wrong owners, leading to higher stress and worse results. Top management does not seem receptive to changes; either that or something has gone wrong with middle management who seems squeezed from both sides. While there seems to be a lot of training programmes within the company, they are not really useful to the actual jobscope.

","New execs are bringing in the Bay area mentality. Also, as one would expect, the upper execs are being flooded from Bay. Apparently, all of the most qualified people just happened to have worked at Sandisk - who knew. The number of VP, Senior VP, Executive VP has swollen beyond the point of ridiculous.
Advice to Management
Keep Micron great. Some of the more recent moves such as to force time off are poorly veiled ways to reduce benefits in the name of 'work life balance'. 

Constantly filling the Upper Ranks with Sandisk buddies is killing moral. Historically, there were clear (if not difficult) development paths that led into the upper ranks. You've effectively sent the message that hiring from within is no longer a thing. 

HR needs to get its act together and decide on a consistent message and process that truly benefits the teams rather than be the spokesperson to try to spin a poor decision by execs as a benefit to the people. 

I'm rating Culture and Values lower because the culture is being forced into the Bay area Culture. There are some good things it's brought such as flexible work hours (still more theoretical than practical) but with it comes the expectation to compete w/ coworkers to beat them out as top performer or risk being the loser in a forced distribution rating system (even if your team is full of rock stars, someone has to be rated low). It's an odd message to say we value the People but were going to create a cutthroat environment. I suppose this mentality works in Bay area where you can walk across the street and get a new job - likely at a pay raise. However, in areas like Boise, job security, and company/employee loyalty are real values and part of the culture. You would find a much stronger workforce if you built on that.

","Too many differences between how each shift is run and how each department is run, needs more consistence. Some of the team leads are not suited for their positions. Programs are phased out constantly with new programs coming in every year. The amount of extra accountability they are trying to push can get a little redundant. Could use some better company standardization, each fab has it's own way of doing things. Not much room for moving out of current position. There are few opportunities to move out of your current job role. If you are good at your job they will keep you there even if you apply for another position.

2018-02-12, Software Engineer,"Boise, ID","Current Employee, more than 5 years",An environment that is changing and improving quickly,"- Lots of diversity here: management and employees of many different races/ethnicities, lots of international collaboration (including travel)

- Flexible schedules: Show up when you want and leave when you want, work from home

- Solid benefits: Competitive salary, bonuses, raises, stock, stock options, decent paid time off, decent retirement plan options

- Colleagues are generally very nice and supportive with varying degrees of knowledge, intelligence, and skills

- Low-stress environment: Rooms with ping-pong, treadmill desks, yoga, darts, couch + TV, etc, depending on the building you work in. Break rooms with lots of snacks. Good cafeteria (definitely compared to a few years ago). Wellness program that awards points for steps and other activities which can be redeemed for gift cards or rewards

- Great mobility for moving to other departments/areas

- Lots of ""extra-curricular"" events/opportunities: women's groups, community activism, diversity initiatives, technical seminars, etc.

- Company used to operate like it was in the stone ages, but it's fast-forwarding in the present with the new leadership; department structures are flattening and transforming into self-managing teams, employee recognition and incentives are improving quickly.

- Money: The company is swimming in it. Assuming you're not in a department that has a very low budget, expect department BBQs with beer, training sessions that are catered, and having to spend insane amounts of time interviewing and recruiting because of how much we're hiring!

- Not a ""starter"" company: employees of all different ages, very low turnover for the industry
","- Inconsistency: Micron is a huge place with a major hierarchy of management. Different areas operate very differently as far as how they treat employees and advance their careers, how discerning their hiring is, etc. Certain departments/divisions are DEFINITELY better to work for than others. Be prepared to move around if you end up in the ""wrong"" place. Hopefully the new leadership will drive better alignment.

- Poor management training: I've heard too many horror stories of leads and managers who never took Management 101 and frustrated their direct reports to no end. The company as of now does not mandate any sort of upward feedback, so unless you complain, things don't generally change. I'm hoping that the new leadership recognizes this and things improve. The good part is that there are competitive leaders in the company: it's just trial and error to find them.

- Overly hierarchical structure: Lots of managers and lots of VPs. When things have to go up a large chain, visibility into decisions gets lost, actions aren't taken, and people get frustrated. In IT, they are pushing a flatter, Agile structure, but I fear for other departments in the company. A more progressive stance would be that all departments in the company push for self-managing structures.

- Regressive mentality: Micron has been doing many things ""the old way"" for far too long. This leads to engineers using old methods or practices that are now extremely deprecated, and not enough people recognize it to drive change. Certain departments are making every effort to embrace best-in-class practices and methodologies, but others don't.
Advice to Management
Mandate a more progressive vision downwards so everyone embraces it and everyone is aligned. This will ensure that only the best talent is recruited and kept, and teams and departments are being managed effectively.

","1. Lack of refined Back End business processes that globally integrate Marketing, Engineering, and Manufacturing. This gap necessitates navigation of ambiguous business ecosystems that are held together by human glue. 
2. Marketing forecasts in certain market segments are constantly changing, resulting in whip-sawing of Manufacturing capacity enablement.
3. Over reliance on acronyms (ORA).
4. Too many managers and executives.
Advice to Management
1. Streamline management and executive chain. Eliminate management positions that have no reports.
2. Invest in some SSD R&D!
3. Eradicate all org changes for at least 18 months. Let the company stabilize. 
4. Implement global business processes that destroy silo-ization of Marketing, Engineering, and Manufacturing.

2018-01-23, Design Engineer,"Boise, ID","Former Employee, more than 5 years",Nice place to work in a nice location,"The first thing you will notice is the time off, they offer European levels of time off, and you'll never use it all (probably, most people had surplus, they started forcing people to use it). 

The starting pay is alright, good for Boise. Regular stock options, and stock offerings. The health center is really sweet!

Culture there is more conservative overall, that can be a pro or a con depending on how you lean.

Work life balance is ok, depends on the department a lot, but I didn't really have an issue with this. They allowed me to work from home during ice storms or when sick.

They do encourage learning and growth within your existing role, taking college classes always gets approved.

I didn't leave Micron because Micron, I left because I wanted to live someplace else, If you're an engineer and want to live in Boise, Micron is your best bet, and it's not a bad bet either. Some of the best engineers I've ever worked with were at Micron.
","Well, it's conservative, for me that was a tad bit of a con, yes, it's a good ol' boys club, I can deal but come on, it's the 21st century.

They promote and give raises very very slowly, so your pay gets less competitive over time unless you complain loud and outperform everyone else. They also don't support career changes, want to change tracks? Good luck, they like to keep you where you're at.

Sometimes getting new ideas implemented requires going through a lot of office politics, especially if some senior person is pushing their idea and wants to get another pip on their collar. The politics can get nasty, and it doesn't seem to be getting any better.

They also seem to hire senior leaders based on politics and not qualifications, one director I worked under claimed to be a big shot at a former company, I asked around at that company, no one even remembered his name let alone knew what he did. Again, more politics.
Advice to Management
First, invest in your people, give people a real career path. Part of that will require breaking up the little office empires. There have been some good steps towards this in the last few years I was there, keep that momentum going.

Get rid of the petty office politics, find ways to discourage that behavior, it stifles innovation and reduces productivity which ultimately hurts the bottom line.

Stop hiring leaders based on either who they know of what crazy stuff they claim they can do or have done, start checking references more and bringing in people based on merit, these yahoos are driving certain departments into the ground.

Weak management, leaders are not built here
Commitment to ever increasing goals to maintain the luster while production and maintenance are stretched to the limits despite the legacy products bringing in a very nice premium
Site and department goals change at least quarterly, sometime during the quarter
Much of the 2nd level and higher management are so far removed from the floor operations, and have never worked on the floor, that they have only the most basic ideas of what really goes on.
Not much room for advancement; IF you can advance as a technician, it's a near impossibility to make it to a 1st shift position as turnover is light and 'business needs' will probably dictate that someone from another area fill the spot.

2017-09-04, Probe Engineer,"Boise, ID","Current Employee, more than 5 years",New Directions for Probe Engineering,"Micron has been growing for a number of years, and it endured some growing pains. After it acquired some smaller memory companies (and one sizable one), the product portfolio became so big that probe and test engineering was severely strained by the workload. While that's still true, the teams are adapting to the challenge with a stronger focus on cross-team collaboration and using newer and better tools to become more efficient. There is a lot of opportunity to impact the success of the new game-changing products that are in the works, and the work extends far beyond simply writing code to test chips: there's a lot of understanding the physics and materials of the chips, the ways they fail, and the hardware they're tested on. It is easy to keep busy in interesting ways.
","Change is hard, and some engineers are set in their ways with how they get things done, which does slow progress. There are also a few very strong personalities that unfortunately are allowed to dominate the environment, with some becoming overly negative or even hostile towards the work other engineers have accomplished.

You have some very bright and innovative people working there, but you are holding them back. Work towards a culture of innovation. Teams and orgs drift towards silos and get stuck in red tape fighting change. These forces slow the pace of innovation and make the company late to market with improving technologies, and keep the most revolutionary ideas at bay.

Give raises to people who carry the company. Don't wait till a specified time. Do it on the spot.

2017-08-08, Process Engineer,"Manassas, VA","Current Employee, more than 5 years",All the good talent is leaving. High turnover,"- Location in Manassas OK
- Some of the employees are good to work with 
- Close to big city like D.C. 
- Good medical insurance
","- Company has no interest in Micron Virginia site 
- Most hardworking and talented people have left in 2017
- Very demotivating management who treats engineers like secretaries for making presentations and useless updates
- Company has Blue Collar Mentality where you are treated like a laborer/worker who won't get any jobs outside Micron especially the workers on H1Bs. 
- Company projects itself as Fortune 500 company but in reality works like a textile sweatshop in Asia.
- Since last year most of the talent has either left Micron or Moved to Asia sites within Micron
- Only way to get more money is through promotions and even that is not up to the mark with competitors in Northern Virginia nor with Other semiconductor firms in USA
- There is Almost NO annual salary raise to account for INFLATION and cost of living increase with economy. So basically they give you market adjustment or increment like once in 3 years. That is also like a demeaning low percentage.
- If you interview with them and don't negotiate a good starting salary then you are basically working on the same salary for next 3-4 years. 
- If I could go back in time as a Graduate, I would not work for them ever.
- Work-life balance is horrible, managers want you to stay beyond your work hours as it is necessary ""to show you are committed to company."" Only company I have seen in this age and time where salaried employees are monitored like high school kids
- Micromanagement is so high that some employees need to take medicines for tension and anxiety due to work related stress (not exaggerating)
- The one and only paid cafeteria onsite is so horrible that most employees go out to eat. Food is not even fit for human consumption.
Advice to Management
- My only hope is new CEO and I really hope he does something about our salaries at least a respectable market adjustment and a fair promotion system.

Retirement savings plans, and thankfully health and life insurance.
Made several friends for life.
Found success in team building, that was very rewarding
","A legacy parts producer with a limited shelf life that no longer budgets for employee appreciation.
The company remains nearly 85% male and this sexism is furthered by promoting men to lower management positions from strongly male dominated cultures who may not even be aware they tend to promote men before women.
Micron has been working to reduce redundancy and non value tasks in Fab positions, but rarely rises to middle management jobs. 
Currently workers at the bottom of the production chain have picked up the off load of jobs from both the process and the tool sides. MT's are now very few with generally double the workload they started with, but very very minimal increase in pay. No one knows how much work came actually correctly completed in one 12 hour shift. It seems like a strange strategy for cost cutting. Employee headcount goes down to bare bones causing their workload to increase even more, which leads to greater risk to the product and lower tool efficiency. Does eliminating low end low paying jobs save enough money to offset scrapped wafers and loss of tool production time? Even when you consider these employees are doing double duty for essentially the same pay rate? Wouldn't retaining low cost labor instead provide an opportunity for a better distribution of work which could easily translate to less human scrap and less lost production time for tool malfunctions?
Last, it doesn't matter how hard you work, how much you know, how well you document your development, if you ask for additional responsibilities or for development opportunities to benefit your performance. There is just one person, one person who can either help you get where you really want to go or make your life so miserable you can't even let it go once you've left for the day. They can count on your participation, use you to any extent they need, but toss you off the bus solely because they like someone better, and I've seen people go just because a manager has to chop heads, and he personally prefers someone else. How in 2017 can an international company hope to succeed when it doesn't even realize that from the top down, they promote managers who chooses employees not for their value to the company, but in a personality contest.

Advice to Management
Instead of just using indices, go walk the ground and see what's going on. There are many engineers who work till late night everyday as the meetings are back to back for the entire day and they only get to sit down at their desk after official office hours to start doing work. Incredibly, there are actually some engineers who have next to nothing responsibilities assigned to them and literally doing nothing everyday!

Advice to Management
Always research who is working under you. Don't just assume that when you hired them by someone else's advice. Study their history carefully. Don't do generalized reviews on their performances. Every review needs a peer to weigh in on their performance, not just mangers making sweeping statements like ""everybody gets a 2 this time and only the very elite will barely get a 3 and forget a 4, nobody deserves a 4"". This is how the good employees at MTV have been scammed in the last 12 years. Don't send Lead engineers to do reviews. They are not trained.

As a MNC, there is a glass ceiling at which point higher/ more executive positions only exist in headquarters in the US. The positive side of this being there are occasional opportunities to relocate, but you've got to really look out, work hard for them and also get a bit lucky.

3. China is expanding semiconductor production like crazy. makes you wonder how long can the industry survive in Singapore. Many top engineers and managers left to take up positions in China.
Advice to Management
Most people want to grow and develop a better life for themselves. Please give them a chance and not just focus on bringing your friends into the company.

2017-01-04,Anonymous,"Boise, ID","Former Employee, more than 5 years",The management team needs to go,"There are very good people working there, though they tend to either not stay long or become beat down and discouraged before long. 

The benefits and pay are about the best you will find in Boise.
","The senior management team at micron needs to go. They don't understand that the world is not a DRAM, don't see that continuing to do business as usual and ignore the changing landscape will not work, and won't give new blood the chance to influence direction. They are smart enough to realize that they need to branch out, but keep failing by trying to force all projects into the paradigm they expect. When projects cannot flourish on a memory chip model, they invariably under fund them and expect unrealistic schedules. Other programs they force into memory design paradigms and then don't kill or rethink them even after years of failed revisions and missed market windows. 
Unless you are a member of the old boys club, you will never be promoted into the upper tiers of the engineering ladder, and will have very little chance of influencing the company to the better.
Advice to Management
Fire everyone at the director level and above (yes, the VPs especially) and allow the company to flourish.

","Work-life balance was very often disrupted due to company first culture and mandatory overtime. Little-no support for non-leadership employees and considering the fact the company is quite top heavy this has a major impact.
