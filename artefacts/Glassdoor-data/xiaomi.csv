Now talking about the so called HR team, they have no proper policies, processes in place. They make you dance to their tunes. All the good one's have left until most recently, there was one hrbp who was really good and knowledgeable but unfortunately again that hrbp left quiet recently not sure for what reason. So they can never value good resources. 6.The remaining folks in hr subordinates have bare minimum knowledge about anything.

Now just to be fair its dependent on the team you work in and of course it helps if you joined the company a million years ago. About those people who joined a million years ago, they refuse to embrace any change or suggestions and are completely comfortable in their elevated thrones to do anything different. If you do join, note that they will flout their name and hence justify not paying you enough. Say goodbye to having a personal life because you have to be at the beck and call of your overlords. Everything and I mean everything is in Chinese control and the illusion of you doing work that actually matters is ridiculous.

Look beyond your favourites! - Employee retention does not happen through structured regular connects . It is very ad hoc, mostly through managers who are individually brilliant but not as a methodical approach which can reach larger number of employees. The HR team has zero contributions to employee retention - Their India salaries need to match the market, the hikes are very poor - Their HR team is one of the worst I've seen. They have no clue how to hire and on board employees and once hired, they do not know how to manage employees at all - Employees have a terrible experience interacting with the HR team and I am frankly surprised how the CEO and COO have let this continue knowing fully well how incompetent the HR team is - Exiting employees are treated the worst, forced to serve notices without any empathy for personal exigencies, sometimes even threatened with legal action just for asking to reduce the notice and exit early even by adjusting/ foregoing salary.

2019-11-04, Sales and Marketing,"Reading, England, England","Former Employee, more than 1 year",Absolutely Disgusting!,"None. Unless you're a graduate or a Chinese, stay away and don't waste your time. If you have a family and you're not looking for a short term experience where you'll lose money and mental health, don't even think about Xiaomi. The current staff turnover rate in the UK is 100% and in Europe overall is probably 70%.
","- In the UK you're not hired by Xiaomi but you're hired by an umbrella company called Roevin which uses a payroll company to pay you, ICS. This structure generates a lot of confusion and makes any complaint you have impossible to be heard; - Your salary, way below average, won't be paid in full because Xiaomi divide it in 14 months (Chinese way) but they won't pay you the last 2 months as they're based on performance/permanence and they never ever make it result as a success, even if your KPIs are 200% overachieved. After all, at Xiaomi, saving money from the workforce is HR main KPI; - Because of the previous points, what your contract says is absolutely irrelevant - including place of work, responsibilities etc; - They relocate offices in the UK with a few weeks notice to accommodate HR comforts and needs. They don't offer the chance to negotiate compensation for transport costs to employees and these will be sacrificed from your current salary; - You pay taxes on your expenses due to the fact that under Roevin you're effectively a contractor. Xiaomi and Roevin invite you to lie about SDC (supervision, direction and control) in order to get your taxes back; - There's no budget for you to work on. Actually, the company has huge debts with all the main distributor and is facing formal notices because not willing to pay millions. The UK market goal was to get to 10% market share in the first year, however, the marketing investment made by Xiaomi to achieve that was £27K - equal to what competitors would spend in one day for team lunch; - You won't have a line manager or any leadership. If you get one he/she will be a graduate or an intern sent from Xiaomi HQ as they don't trust non-Chinese/locals; - Be ready for a high level of discrimination if you're not Chinese. Also, you can't progress in your career if you're not Chinese and even if your colleagues push you for that and offer roles in other teams/markets etc, your career progressions will be blocked by the local HR team in order to keep their staff turnover rate low and avoiding finding replacements. HR tends to use defamation against you for this purpose; - The HR department is notoriously the worst in the whole industry. In Europe, the HR team is exclusively made of Chinese people who most of the time don't speak/understand English and their only responsibility is to report to senior management about local employees, effectively having a decision making role with absolutely no understanding of marketing, sales etc. Obviously they try to save as much money a possible from employees, meaning that they'll never ever pay you in full, no matter what your contract says. Be aware they use defamation a lot for these purposes as well; - The management threatens employees to be fired in WeChat public groups every single day in order to boost performances. This is accepted internally as considered ""a way to motivate and inspire people"". Yes, it's disgusting just like the rest of this company.

My actual manager didn't have any clue, neither did she have an interest in my progress or my contributions. Other ""senior"" team members claim to be your managers and expect respect for their self-proclaimed authority. As such - across the organization - there is no accountability, and this creates a perfect atmosphere for favoritism and anarchy. - Hierarchical. In the age of flat structures and open work environments, this company has people that say ""Chinese have a very hierarchical culture, and you cannot annoy your boss, and you cannot annoy, criticize, or give opinions of your Chinese counterparts."" So, effectively, Indian employees end up only boot-licking their Chinese counterparts, even if they are of lower designation. - HQ interference and condescending behaviour. In FMCG and Consumer Electronics industries, all companies give a high degree of freedom to each geographical office to cater to specific cultural and socio-economic dynamics. NOT AT XIOAMI! No, Sir! Folks from China and Singapore hold the reigns to just about everything. Indian work has to go through 100 levels of screening and scrutiny, but China and Singapore hardly ever inform Indian teammates about progress and projects. This is not just frustrating, but also condescending and disrespectful.
