","- Terrible management - Power tripping debugs, leads, and supervisors - Needlessly strict security (ex: high metal detector sensitivity) - Favoritism (particularly towards certain ethnicity) - Terrible at taking feedbacks - Ugly uniforms This is the kind of job you want to do when you have nowhere else to work for; a temporary job to take while looking for a real job. It's certainly not something you want to advance from, or let alone make a career of.

","They carried out a useless policy in a silly and ineffective manner. We originally had a test to see if we can use screws within a certain time before getting hired. When I got rehired, they didn't do this test beforehand. We got this on our first work day with no notice. There wasn't even a procedure this time - just a fellow coworker seeing us unscrew and screw on ONE screw, no timer, no notes. Just marked something on his paper and separated us by people who passed and failed according to whatever criteria he used. It was never mentioned and we all did a good job with it, but according to this guy we weren't doing screwing to his liking and that gave the company grounds to end our assignment. How it was carried out was rather poorly. 10 minutes into our second work day, we were told we needed to leave and security escorted us out. It was abrupt and no warning was given. I know I can use screws because that was my station when I was originally hired. Because of this decision, we aren't allowed to get rehired there.

","Micro management. Expected to stay long hours at work even if there is nothing to do. Highly underpaid engineers. No compensation for working overtime for months, including weekends. Ideas and potential new projects to improve or optimize factory conditions fall on deaf ears. Some supervisors abuse their power by dumping company money for personal things and take phones home as they please. Management threatens to fire individuals all the time. Meetings are held everyday for 4-5 hours but most of them are in Mandarin. Shady business practices.

","This company repairs notebooks from HP, Toshiba, and Asus. This company discriminates against Americans. They bring Asian people in on vacation visas and they get away with it. They even tell you in company meetings that if you (americans) do the job then I wouldn't need to bring them in, but this is their way of getting rid of hard working people. On the repair floor not one American is in charge and that is not by mistake. Instead of paying people more they just bring people in from California. So many affairs going on there with upper management and employees. I wouldn't buy anything from HP they are aware of this and only stay because they don't pay anything the more HP finds wrong the less Pegatron gets paid so it is win win for HP. HP's quality went down when they split. Pegatron has never had quality don't send your business there unless you want recycled parts not tested put in your customer's notebooks. Pegatron doesn't hire people with skill cause they don't want to pay them. The doors should be shut on this place. Immigration should check this place out.
