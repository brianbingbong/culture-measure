","Very inflexible, not a lot of work-life balance. Expected to do 2-3 people's workload with not a lot of recognition. No opportunity to progress, nepotism, few senior managers keep being regurgitated by being moved around departments, with not a lot of accountability. Many team leaders like to micro-manage their team, so you never feel trusted. The general culture is like being back in primary school (on one occasion an employee was put in a time-out for looking at their phone) Since the mass redundancies were announced HR an senior management proved day after day how little they care about the employees' lives. They're treated with disrespect and don't get a lot of support. I could go on all day, but probably anyone reading this gets the idea of how toxic a working environment to expect. I would have given zero stars, if I had the option.

Japanese ideals, good management structure, helpful and approachable bosses. Basically, has a calm and stable environment.
Cons
Nascent technologies and risk aversion, in some areas, portfolio might not have current industrial value proposition maturity but still lacks the requisite startup culture needed to make things happen. For such immature portfolios, there isn't any systematic process in place, have had colleagues think up product strategies on the fly - without any form of market research whatsoever. But that's something we handle at work every day. It also probably needs to attract the cream of talent Singapore and the Asia Pacific can offer. A very sales oriented environment, it's like every component is built to sell... every layer.

Lack of structured on-the-job training to help new hires to ease into the new environment and be clear of their job scope.
