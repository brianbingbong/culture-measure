Good place to snatch up quick experience then hop.
","By far the greatest weakness is the unwillingness to hire and to give competitive industry compensation. This leads to an extremely heavy workload on the staff which leads to burn out, delays and eventual apathy. This is damming to a brand and customer relationships. 

The refusal to either pay more for qualified engineers or lower requirements for said engineers led to the short staff. This leads to high turn around or simply no staff to work. 

Raises were supposed to happen in April, but were ""delayed"" due to pandemic. Finally was given in August and then not mentioned again this year during April. 

Remote work is not given to employees who obviously who do not need to physically need to be onsite.

Nearly no career progression here at all.
Advice to Management
Stop cheaping out on new employees and/or expecting a bargain employee with high credentials. Even if you do get one, they will not stay long. This is evident from the shrink in staff from 12 engineers to just 3 or 4. Thereby tripling the workload. Losing workers and subsequently customer trust is far worse than losing a few hundred thousand or a million in wages.

2020-06-01, Program Manager,"La Vergne, TN","Former Employee, more than 5 years",Still Reeling,"There were positives, but I'm left wondering about the sincerity of the relationships built over my years at Quanta, due to the ultimate end of my time at Quanta. I was afforded the opportunity to turn a flailing Cisco repair business into a roaring success with little interference from Sr. Management. Now I am left to determine if the light hand was a good management decision or their only approach due to a lack of management insight.
","Ultimately responsible for three different departments. Provided overwhelming workload, Sr. Management did not listen when I indicated the need for assistance for 2.5 years. My results began to decline due to the overwhelming workload, so I increased my requests for assistance. The requests fell on deaf ears for more than 2 years. Then, suddenly, I was placed under a micromanager, the limited associates that had reported to me were pressured out, then every additional head I had asked for was provided, and I was pressured to resign after the results began to improve. Too many details to leave here. Sr. Management, who I believed was supportive, turned on a dime, when it meant CY'ing there own A's due to their own negligence and the parent company's insistence that changes were required.
Advice to Management
When asking your ""Why"" questions, accept the truth and change your approach, even if it means admitting you may have made errors in judgement along the way.

Instead your why questions were deliberately pointed, and the answer was always the same, and always true. A complete lack of support and a shortage of time meant that some tasks could not be performed on time. No one asked why the 95% of my responsibilities were fulfilled. It was the 5% that were put on the back burner you asked the ""why"" questions about. Why late? Why not perfect? Why not complete?
My question for you... Why no help since 2018? Why no memory of telling our customer that you had not placed me in a position to succeed? Why not enough courage to share in the blame when the the parent company turned up the heat?

""ASK - TELL - ESCALATE"" Is a legend in your own mind and will only work, if you respond to escalations brought to you. Ignoring the escalations for over 2 years and then acting as if those escalations never occurred while forcing out an associate that sold his soul for your business, because you were feeling the heat doesn't fix the issues that led to the problems. It may keep you from sweating it out this time, but the problems remain. Those who resigned before me didn't fix the problems, those who will resign after me won't fix the problems.
I'll struggle due to my age, but I don't know how to quit anything, as I assume you noticed, so with God's grace, I'll figure this out too.

Mean what you say, or what you say will become only so much fodder in the memory of those you ultimately force out to protect your own reputations.

Currently, it is feared, not respected, not because anyone expects positive results to come from those three steps, but because they simply don't want to hear your self aggrandizing lectures.

This ""criticism"" is meant to help you and your current and future employees and really no other purpose.

Pros
The department that I went to was quite friendly and constructive. There are plenty of flexibilities regarding the leaves you take. The department was also duty -focused where you can actually do anything you like as long as your tasks are finished. Managers are quite cool.
Cons
Lack of formal training. You need to be very proactive in learning. Some senior employees may envy top performers.

- Good for pensioner but not for young persons who thrive to learn more
","- Very repetitive tasks
- OEM
- Considered low-medium salary in Electronic industry
- Very often to work more than 12hrs/day. Hassles on working overtime payment applications which also often not signed as well. Sometimes you work overtime for nothing but to get sick.
- Less and less incentive (cost down)
- Information dissipation is very very bad. Some people just bulk all the information trying to over smart people which are bad for teamwork.
Advice to Management
- Try to hold up more meetings internally, brief your employees so we have a common sense of missions
- Try to not over smart people by bulking all the information, especially Technical information, where you try to tell employees to assemble an engine without giving employees any blueprint or SOP and hopes everything goes well.
