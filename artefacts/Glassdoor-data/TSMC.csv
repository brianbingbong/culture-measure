No way to improve. The company now is now rapidly expanding (going to have new fab in Germany, Arizona and Japan). If they still use the same Taiwanese management style, no workers in those locations would accept it. It will eventually lead to some problems for recruiting.

2021-07-06, Equipment Engineer,"Phoenix, AZ","Current Employee, less than 1 year",TSMC Fab Equipment Engineer,"Was able to train in Taiwan, work for one of the most important companies on the planet that no one knows about, be exposed to culture outside the US, am being given skills I can take to lot's of desirable positions in the future.

There are incompatibilities between work culture, learning/teaching style and other expectations from the US to Taiwan. This is to be expected. My trainer I think has definitely met me part way, and I believe I can say I have done the same. There's still a gap, but this can be worked on.
","The work culture in Taiwan is really different than in the US. I am sure TSMC will have to change to an 8 hour work day five days a week or do what other companies do with Fabs and run three days on, four days off, four days on, three days off rotations. As it is right now in Taiwan The minimum amount of time at the company is 10 hours a day, but realistically is running up to even 12 hours a day. This is for those of us who are American training to go back to the new operation in Arizona. The reality for people from Taiwan is that they are doing even more than 12 hour days often. There's also the night shifts and weekend shifts on duty and/or on call. That last part is understandable as the fab lives 24/7.

The training in this experience really depends on one person who is your ""trainer"". My experience has lacked any structure, but had no shortage of expectations. I came up with some process to approach learning new equipment and daily tasks, but to be honest don't know that I've arrived yet.

TSMC doesn't seem to enshrine a sense of individual freedom. The company provides housing for those of us training from the states, but has very much micromanaged everything we do in our living arrangement. There's a curfew with no guests allowed for example. And the long term housing adds another hand hour commute.
Advice to Management
The software used by TSMC is dated. Of course TSMC may not be alone in this as industry doesn't have the same motivation in software decisions as the consumer driven market has, which results in amazingly optimized applications. The apps people know and love meet a minimalist and aesthetic criteria for a reason. Big companies don't have the motivation but minimalist software with an aesthetic UI makes people more efficient at what they're doing and can save the company time. TSMC could even justify having its own internal software development team, and it would save massive amounts of money in people's time. A lot of software at TSMC also seems to be repetitive. TSMC should reduce the amount of software it has for different tasks, find functions that are repeated across applications and reduce to a common application.

I joined TSMC for the same reason I became an engineer. I want to do something I'm passionate about and improve peoples lives in a lasting way. Semiconductors are a magic bullet that have changed and are changing our quality of life and the way we live. Unfortunately it seems TSMC doesn't enable the same outcome for many of its employees as the technology enables for the planet. The percentage of the budget going to pay employees at a company like TSMC is small compared to the cost of a fab, the equipment it houses, defective product and other issues. There's no reason TSMC can't increase the number of employees it has to allow people to go home to their families at a reasonable time each day and give them good benefits. I think TSMC might at least approach this in Arizona as it has to compete to retain and attract talent against companies like Intel right across the street.

Too much time is spent in meetings to review the work from the last night/day in the morning, and to review what was done during the day again in the afternoon. These meetings add up to three hours in a day easily. That's a lot of the work day. Some of the solution may be in software. I truly believe most of these meetings could be automated. The engineer who last worked with the equipment would record tool status and changes, and makes recommendations. The manager gives approval to any recommendation or overrides, and the engineer coming into the next shift only looks at the tools they've been assigned to on this ""hypothetical"" application. The only person it makes sense to have three hours looking at this stuff is the manager who would have to make approval, hold engineers accountable or interject if need be. The rest of the staff should be able to cover the material that actually relates to them on their own in five to ten minutes. TSMC could automate this through software. This could also solve some of the issue with the long work days. People in TSMC Taiwan honestly are not being more productive than Americans on an eight hour work day. But tasks which don't contribute to what actually needs to be done in an efficient way suck up the employees time.

The ""e-learning"" system TSMC uses to teach new employees is terrible and needs to be abandoned. I would seriously recommend TSMC to provide an anonymous survey to the entire company, but also specifically to the American hires as there are additional translation issues from Chinese which make the learning even worse. Chances are high that if the survey is actually anonymous people will confess they haven't learned anything from the e-learning, and it just wasted time they needed to learn their process.

Repor","The software used by TSMC is dated. Of course TSMC may not be alone in this as industry doesn't have the same motivation in software decisions as the consumer driven market has, which results in amazingly optimized applications. The apps people know and love meet a minimalist and aesthetic criteria for a reason. Big companies don't have the motivation but minimalist software with an aesthetic UI makes people more efficient at what they're doing and can save the company time. TSMC could even justify having its own internal software development team, and it would save massive amounts of money in people's time. A lot of software at TSMC also seems to be repetitive. TSMC should reduce the amount of software it has for different tasks, find functions that are repeated across applications and reduce to a common application.

I joined TSMC for the same reason I became an engineer. I want to do something I'm passionate about and improve peoples lives in a lasting way. Semiconductors are a magic bullet that have changed and are changing our quality of life and the way we live. Unfortunately it seems TSMC doesn't enable the same outcome for many of its employees as the technology enables for the planet. The percentage of the budget going to pay employees at a company like TSMC is small compared to the cost of a fab, the equipment it houses, defective product and other issues. There's no reason TSMC can't increase the number of employees it has to allow people to go home to their families at a reasonable time each day and give them good benefits. I think TSMC might at least approach this in Arizona as it has to compete to retain and attract talent against companies like Intel right across the street.

Too much time is spent in meetings to review the work from the last night/day in the morning, and to review what was done during the day again in the afternoon. These meetings add up to three hours in a day easily. That's a lot of the work day. Some of the solution may be in software. I truly believe most of these meetings could be automated. The engineer who last worked with the equipment would record tool status and changes, and makes recommendations. The manager gives approval to any recommendation or overrides, and the engineer coming into the next shift only looks at the tools they've been assigned to on this ""hypothetical"" application. The only person it makes sense to have three hours looking at this stuff is the manager who would have to make approval, hold engineers accountable or interject if need be. The rest of the staff should be able to cover the material that actually relates to them on their own in five to ten minutes. TSMC could automate this through software. This could also solve some of the issue with the long work days. People in TSMC Taiwan honestly are not being more productive than Americans on an eight hour work day. But tasks which don't contribute to what actually needs to be done in an efficient way suck up the employees time.

The ""e-learning"" system TSMC uses to teach new employees is terrible and needs to be abandoned. I would seriously recommend TSMC to provide an anonymous survey to the entire company, but also specifically to the American hires as there are additional translation issues from Chinese which make the learning even worse. Chances are high that if the survey is actually anonymous people will confess they haven't learned anything from the e-learning, and it just wasted time they needed to learn their process.

2. Solid market share of the company, hence the job is quite stable in the long term.

3. Accept people from many fields with many kinds of position.
","1. The package looks big, but the pay is very low. Most of the package comes from the quarter bonus, which means the package has the strong correlation with the performance of the company at that year.

2. Disastrous work-life balance. Overtime working, full time standby, and holiday working is not only common but also continue for a very long time.

3. Slow learning curve of professional knowledge for each single field unless principal engineer level or higher.

4. Closed culture and knowledge(especially for system level). It take you a lot to learn these internal systems, but it almost left you nothing when you step out the lobby.

Advice to Management
Company Values are not something which you just advertise on company's website. They are what the company actually lives by, they reflect in its policies, decision making- both business and technical, and so do your true value do. Corruption is like cancer - it hollows the organization just like cancer does to body. So irrespective of how things look from outside, the hollow structure will fall apart in tough times.

2019-09-19, Manager,"Kent, WA","Former Employee, more than 5 years",Hell on earth,"Comp is ok, but lags other large companies in the US.
","Taiwanese style management is broken. Poor working environment. Cramming into an elevator with 20 other people in the morning. Cafeteria food that makes you sick every day. No parking if you don't get there by 7:30AM (nice way for the company to get you to come in early). You don't get to use your vacation days.

This entire system is broken. You should not come to TSMC if you have a decent job working in the states. I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy. And also, they work hard to make sure that you can't leave the job (play interference with potential employers, cancel any days off so you can't go interview, etc).
Advice to Management
The problem is management and the hierarchical structure. While employees are crammed 20 to an elevator waiting for 30 minutes, management has 4 designated elevators for their use (that approximately a total of 20-30 people use). Rank designated parking lots, and all these other perks are nothing more than a ""I am better than you culture."" Stop with this bs.

The first step is to honestly just to care (just a little bit) about the employees. Let's start with that, ok?
