2020-12-20, C++ Programmer,Wrocław,Current Employee,Way behind competitors,"- benefits - good place to start for students (they hire basically anybody)
","I've been working here for 2.5 years and I see gradual decline of this company. Upper management pretends to do some changes by changing departments names or merging/splitting them, introducing new tools that either make programmers life way harder than it has to be or are put down in few months. Line managers are focused on bug reports and are convinced that the best employees are those who make most of bug fixes - which are also the people that are introducing those many bugs... So if you write good code and have no bug fixes to implement then your manager most likely won't even notice you exist. Mine has no idea what features we are working on. I think that attitude of management placed Nokia behind competitors and I don't think it'll change any time soon.

2020-12-06, Project Manager,Bangalore,"Current Employee, more than 5 years","Good company to work, but very bureaucratic and cost-oriented","Has some of the best employee leave programs, including bereavement leaves on compassionate grounds (over and above regular leaves) Invests heavily into training their employees with tie-ups with LinkedIn and other universities Salary wise one of the best in the industry
","Very cost-obsessed - Finance, despite being a non-revenue function, has a heavy say in all the decisions Bureaucratic and centralized when it comes to decision making. Have observed difficulties, especially in IT and facilities, in addressing user issues. Internal job movement is cumbersome - their website is a pain to navigate, with employees not even able to select the job grade and the qualifications directly. Lately, several business lines have started following IT service companies' model of making employees slog outside working hours and on weekends, which has a detrimental effect on their health and also results in more hours to rectify the mistakes made

","* Only accepts suggestions that will be on top of the current process or product * Resistant to upgrade software versions * Management is very manipulative * All faults and action items are always redirected to the people below (MGMT Favorite statement: ""If the management has this flaw, what can you do?"") * Innovation activities are only for face value. Just to say Nokia is innovative, because we have innovation activities. No actual innovation on the core product and process. * No matter how good you perform and increased company savings, your salary is always capped to the lowest * Doesn't accept current state. Management is always promoting that the company is striving, even when the stock value is dropping really fast.

","You need a lot of self-discipline. Getting up and focusing on work every day when you are in your home environment takes a great deal of self-discipline and motivation. It can be lonely. Working all day without access to coworkers and colleagues can be very isolating and lonely. It's harder to shut down. There can be less distinction between work and personal life when you work from home, making it harder to shut down and more likely that you will overwork. You lose living space. Creating a home office or workspace can use up living space in your home. Relationships are harder to form. It's hard to establish trust and develop relationships with colleagues and clients when you don't have a daily face-to-face connection.

They are willing to help no matter their position is (as long as they have the time of course). I can ask a query to an architect no problem without jumping through many hoops, I am just a junior. 4) Work is great and challenging. The project is majorly in maintenance mode and feature development is not that big of a concern. Prontos given are not that easy and requires you to read deep in C++ code.
","1) Salary is somewhat not that competitive. The initial salary given is nice but expect less from yearly salaray increase. Not to mention the company bonus is not that great also. I did massive overtimes doing improvement tasks, but still am getting only 15% year-on-year bonus. The reason im not happy with that increase is I know some juniors getting bigger increases from other teams. 2) OT is a big strategy to course-correct when a feature/pronto gets delayed. You will immediately get asked to do weekend OT when this happens.

","- Unprofessional attitude: when you are new to the project, they ask you to start night shift even without having complete knowledge of the project and in some cases, without login credentials - Poor communication among managers, employees, project management and customers: every request is done via email. There is no ticketing system (remedy, ServiceNow, etc) tracking and storing information is very rudimentary because of lack of ticketing tools - Network management doesn't know anything about ITIL framework and procedures. They work without following processes at all, improvising all the time. This leads to unpleasant and stressful situations, doing/undoing/doing/undoing your work over and over again. - Network management doesn't care about your opinion. You can suggest and propose new ways of doing things, but they will tell you ""it's not your scope"" - English is the international language of doing business. Here, you can expect to send your emails in english and get the response back in russian/ucranian/polish, etc... creating huge problems/delays with communication - Physical premises are very old and from time to time they suffer electrical and network issues

They take command of the Fortune tower as if they own this center and they take all the advantages of the employee policies but don't let rest of the employees take the benefits of the same. Politics is the one thing everyone cares about this center. Management will not communicate with you and doesn't maintain the transparency in the processes. At the time of appraisal, they will just let you know the appraisal and won't discuss anything regarding issues, concern employee is facing and what need to be corrected. Extremely unethical folks are there in the management. Be cautious before joining at this Nokia Center.

The guy kept the card and the company y charged me $500 saying I had it. The balance wasn’t even $500 as the corporate guy used it. They gave me a bent door key, which I left on the desk, they refused to pay me saying I didn’t return company property. The worst professional experience I’ve ever had.

","I was part of comptel and with dread read the email saying that comptel would be bought by Nokia in 2017. During the acquisition the Nokia management said that even though many of us at comptel used to work for Nokia / NSN that things were different now and we would be valued and thrive as a standalone business in Nokia. That changed even before the acquisition was completed and Comptel disappeared and we soon realised things were as before. Endless tools and processes to be followed. Nobody to really talk to, just a tool to use. I looked around for another job and was so happy to leave. The same week I resigned they announced a round of job cuts which is an annual affair (there was another round in Jan 2020). I feel sorry for my ex-colleagues (those who are left anyway since they leave on a regular basis). I also feel sorry for Finns in general since Nokia was once a flagship company recognised around the world and something to be proud of. Now they just want to get rid of as many people and save as much money as possible. I'm so glad to work for a competitor of theirs and clap with joy for every customer we take away from Nokia.

2020-03-18, Software Engineer,Wrocław,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Decent for a living, but dull, and at times frustrating","The company offers alright starting compensation and decent benefits. It fosters a respectful, down-to-earth culture among engineers, and sets more or less reasonable expectations for them. Work is usually paced well, and there is rarely an expectation to do overtime and such. If you're happy with doing things quickly and getting tickets out the window, you'll be just fine here.
","You have to be happy with doing things quickly, getting tickets out the window and forgetting about them, because there are pretty much no opportunities for personal development and growth. You're expected to do 'the job', not 'a better job each day', because the former earns the company money more immediately. I mean, it's a megacorp, and it shows. Working here, you're stuck with a bunch of inefficient tools and slow processes. Decision making is a mix of top-down and ""I'll talk to that other team about it"". You'll see either an allergic reaction or a laugh from your colleagues any time you mention 'documentation'. True to the meme, you'll spend a bunch of time in useless meetings that could've been an email or simply take too long. And good luck and godspeed if you want to improve your everyday working environment.

2020-02-25, Architect,Espoo,"Current Employee, more than 10 years","Don't waste your time, go somewhere else. A very toxic culture.","Some of the peoples / engineers are very skilled ones, unfortunately not many are left, but a lot to learn from those individuals.
","There was a great Nokia culture and spirit till the Siemens merger (2007), once that happened, a very hierarchical organisation and culture was implemented. It took years to turn the culture around, still very far from the old Nokia culture and values (ex. Customer Satisfaction, Respect for the individual, Achievement, Continuous learning). Then Nokia purchased back the Siemens stake (2013) so became the only owner of the whole company. That turned out as a great move. Somehow Nokia culture came back and in two years reached the same level as it was in the 90s with tremendous success, clear vision, great execution, openness, direction, but did not last as in 2015, Nokia purchased Alu. That turned all upside-down. Basically the culture that came with the acquisition also thrived. Unfortunately it was the one of lying, cheating, secrecy and so on as most of the leadership team came from Alu or outside Nokia. In other words, Alu purchased Nokia with Nokia money as none of the Nokia values where preserved. Fast forward 5 years later, to 2020 and here is the result: - Management by fear with ""know it all"" attitude. Problems, opinions or arguments of any kind, even well documented are not accepted, moreover are punished. - ""Fake it till you make it"" is the name of the game. Winer is the one that lie, cheat, fake as much as possible. When caught, even by the internal ethics committee, they are not punished, but moreover, they are most of them promoted. - Management does not trust or even bothered to listen to experts and engineers, as a result, peoples does not trust management. Very vicious circle, hard to break especially that top management is surrounded by lieutenants that only execute blindly the orders. - Promotion and encouragement of total secrecy and fierce internal competition making peoples and teams to hate each other, fight for their life basically. No sharing of info. A lot of duplicate work just because of the ""not made here"" disease. As a result, best solutions never win. - Pure politically driven decisions against the Nokia overall health. No corporate global long term vison. No alignment between business units of any kind. - Management totally disconnected and blinded by their own political agendas. It seems that they are in a closed loop not accepting any input that is not aligned or does not confirm their personal views. - Continuous layoffs (at least once a year in last 10 years) based on random decisions, very much accelerated after the Alu acquisition. In other words, does not matter what you do, how you do, how you perform. If you are in the wrong place, in the wrong time, you are out. It happened that for a certain project, best of the best where gathered to make it happened and one year later, all fired when project was ditched. - Continuous internal reorganisations (up to 4-5 reorganisations only in 2019), basically breaking teams, breaking network, breaking all connections, very hard to accomplish anything. No explanations, no justification. Changes just for the sake of changes. - Peoples wellbeing is only on paper: filthy offices, very noisy open spaces, zero facilities for any activities except some ridiculous gyms in very bad locations, ethical office is just show off as does not have in practice any effect, compensation below industry average.

","Everything ... 1. As i have mentioned there is no work, so growth is not there. 2. Too much politics .. 3. From a developer point of view very very less opportunity to learn anything . 4. Although they say that they have the policy of internal job switching but it depends on the manager and his manager, whether you will be released or not . They will threaten people who over tries to switch internal saying.. it will get blocked from higher management. So now u have come to bad book higher management ..etc... So ultimately people leave .. 5. Micro management at its peak level. 6. Rather than doing any actual work, they will spend time for just unnecessary , redundant Meeting and meetings.. and for which delivery gets delayed. when the delivery date comes, if u raise these concerns, they will simply refuse. 7. DON'T join specially if you are developer. U will join as developer.. then u will do testing work .. As there is not much work.. maximum time u will do testing only.. 8. Salary is avg . Less than other product companies.. they will give around 12lpa for 7 exp. If are lateral joining with higher package. Next 2 years u will not get hike. But yeah.. if you want relaxed life.. no work. No career growth. With a decent salary , come to office at 10 and leave by 6 then it is good for u.. that is the reason in Glassdoor every review has that ""work life balance"" .. Think twice before joining this company. Don't join Just because of brand name..It's your career .

2020-01-08,Anonymous,"Austin, TX","Current Employee, more than 5 years",Sinking Ship,"* Good benefits * Lots of good coworkers * Very generous vacation (if you can find time to use it) * Probably a good place for an internship or co-op. Some of the college kids working here make as much as some of the full-time employees who have been here for years and have established solid relationships with our customers.
","* Lots of management but no leadership * Lots of talking but no communication * The company is extremely siloed, so problems are often tossed over the wall to someone else's silo rather than being fixed. * The software is developed with no input from the people who actually implement it in production, so time and effort is constantly wasted on both the development side and the implementation side. * Technology roadmaps are almost purely designed for buzzword compliance. They look good on the surface, but there is nothing beneath that surface. Each team is developing in isolation, so the modernization efforts are really about reimplementing the same bad designs with new stacks, rather than fundamentally improving the software portfolio. * Penny wise and pound foolish in a number of ways * Very little incentive for experienced people to stay -- raises are tiny and rare, not remotely keeping up with the cost of living. * Salaries that I'm familiar with are well below average for Austin, even compared to jobs requiring less experience. * The company is replacing experienced regular employees with interns, co-ops, and ever-cheaper contractors. Even after the layoffs stopped or, more likely, slowed down, there has been a steady stream of people quitting for better jobs. A lot of institutional knowledge is already lost, and that trend is likely to continue. * The only opportunity for career advancement is through attrition, but the entry level management positions aren't turning over much, and they don't pay much more than the positions they supervise, despite doubling the workload. Most of the management who have left were management from acquired companies who were marginalized by Nokia after the purchase. * This is a very frustrating time for people in development, services, and operations. If management has a plan for getting from where we are to where they're telling the market we are, they're failing spectacularly at communicating it to the people responsible for making it a reality.

No career path, no future if you are not in the right business unit in the right geography. Most former Alcatel-Lucent employees have asked for redundancy and are waiting around hoping to get one.

","Career paths can be a challenge. Technical track career path is not suitable to keep the people where they can thrive. Most technical experts aim to go to sales or management positions to get to higher levels and rewards. Second is that the company is divided into several business groups. Each looks for their own benefit and not Nokia. Lead Business group function does not work and internal system of revenue sharing between business groups should be reviewed. Post sales in Nokia is very fragmented. No clear ownership towards customers and even internally. Partially due to the Business groups divisions and partially to not being able to have ""active and empowered"" lead functional role for all post sales responsible for each particular customer.

2019-07-18, Technical Lead,Ankara,"Former Employee, more than 8 years",So many wrong things with this company,"Somewhat of a pro: compensation package (eyeglasses/dental, transportation/bike, childbirth - one gross salary, kindergarten, and some other minor expense reimbursements)
","- Plain bad management: managers get promoted from 'inside' based on seniority, not merit or skills. you have to wait 10 years for some other manager to leave or to die to have a chance at being promoted. - they don't foster a trusting environment for the employees and ask for weekly written reports even for seniors with 10+ years experience even though all activity is already tracked in Jira - they don't allow home office even though company policy is 1-2 days/week. - Questionable upper management: Mr. Tommi Uitto has some very dubious and questionable initiatives: promoting gender equality by promoting more women in management positions (this is obviously not bad, but promoting women solely on their gender is...); Also he's comparing work conditions in Nokia with Huawei where people work 6 days/week and sometimes sleep in the office only to conclude how good it is at Nokia where (some) people are able to work from home 2 days/week. He also used this (and the fact that being together physically as a team will foster better communication) as a basis to cut those two days to one and eventually to 0 (as opposed to more and more companies who figured out the opposite and start implementing full remote work). It's really obvious that management doesn't really care about people. - The technical level of employees is very low. Of course, there are very good people too, but most of them are leaving and juniors are taking their place. - Substandard workspace: huge overcrowded open offices of >120 persons, very noisy very very cold in winter after heavy rain outside you get pools of water randomly all over the office crap coffee no fruits or absolutely anything company sponsored restrooms are incredibly dirty, especially in office H everything is cost-saving oriented, starting with lack of dishwasher soap and paper towels In conclusion, I have no idea how such a badly managed company still exists. Probably thanks to Trump's ban on Huawei and Chinese vendors...

2019-03-02, Solutions Architect,"Helsinki, Southern Finland, Southern Finland","Former Employee, more than 1 year",saving more more important than making it,"cannot think of any. would rather be unemployed than work for nokia.
","I worked for Nokia years ago, was transferred to another software company who then fired everyone in my team. I got a job with Comptel and sadly Nokia bought Comptel, ruined the company and many people (including me) left soon after but Nokia started firing many people as well. When I got fired first time around thanks to Nokia outsourcing I didn't even look at what jobs Nokia was offering .. so basically I would rather have been unemployed than work for Nokia again. Nokia is an awful place to work, the company focusses on huge network deals to operators so quality of the products and employing good people is not important. People are relentlessly and regularly fired from ""high cost"" countries in western Europe and jobs move to india/china/eastern Europe. They did this when I worked there first time around and started doing it again with Comptel products but happily I'm not staying around to see what else happens at Nokia Finland. You only have to look at the drop in numbers in Finland where it's now only 6000 employees and they're firing another 350 in early 2019. I do not know one person in Comptel who says the purchase by Nokia has been a good thing, one of my other colleagues who left wrote in linked in that the company has a culture where saving money is more important than making it, which totally sums up the Nokia culture. It was horrible to work in a company with that attitude and I'm so glad to have left that behind. There are not even people at HR to contact (even when resigning), you use one (of the dozens) of tools they have at Nokia to submit enquiries even to HR. They were even launching a HR chatbot so that your reply would not come from a real person. This state of affairs meant that my resignation request wasn't processed for about 10 days thanks to endless tools and no HR to actually talk to.

","This was once a great innovative Finnish company. After 10yrs with Rajeev Suri at the helm it has become an Indo-Finnish service corporation too big to change and innovate, instead it focuses all its energy on cutting costs and outsourcing work to India. Nokia was quite a diverse company but now all management positions are occupied by Indians, When I left I was the only non-Indian on my team. Despite many the many cost cutting layoffs, Nokia never dismisses any senior managers, directors or vice presidents. These well paid do-nothing oligarchs simply rotate job roles every 6months to a year. Also, despite the NAM region being their biggest and most profitable region, all decisions are made by Global, probably at the spa of Karaportii

Also there is a good level of respect and humility in the work place. People are kind and helpful.
","- Management is basically comprised of ex-researches, with poor management skills. - Although there is an effort to connect Bell Labs with the real word challenges faced in the market, this effort unfortunately falls short. - An unbelievable amount of time is spent in presentation and demo preparations, and relative little in solving the problem at hand. The more buzzwords you put on your presentations, the better. Often the presentations are misleading, because they make claims that don't hold, or omit to mention important limitations. - There is a large amount of duplication of work across teams, due to lack of communication, or simply because different managers want a piece of the pie of the next Big Thing (e.g. analytics, ML, Cloud) - Compensation is average, and it increases in-pace (that is slowly) with the industry average. In other words, if you are a smart engineer/researcher, you are better off in another company.

2018-09-22, Research and Development Engineer,"Manila, Manila, Manila","Former Employee, more than 1 year","Good Amenities, Bad Way of Work, Profit-first Mindset, Bug-driven Development","THE GOOD + Starting pay: Relatively good compared to other companies. + Medical benefits: With little to no external comparison, I still think it can serve the needs of an employee and his/her dependents fairly well, simply based on the prices of medical care these days. + Time flexibility: You can come and go anytime within good reason and professionalism (completing your task and/or work hours). + Facilities/equipment: The desks are ergonomic. There are different kinds of rooms (e.g. small booths for an individual, gym, pantries, meeting rooms of varying sizes and designs that inspire one to be focused on work). Provided laptop/monitor (which you can't take out of the office) are top notch. Lockers provided have enough room for a bag and other items to fit into.
","THE BAD - Being deadline and delivery oriented: This may inherently be a problem of the nature of IT/business, but its ultimate priority is to have a good image to its customers and ensure consequent money in-flow (profit). In order to retain the image of being on-track to its customers, the pressure to deliver a potentially shippable product per sprint (2-3 week time frame of work) is put on lower management and developers. Code is made to be externally working and superficially bug free, without necessarily having a solid, well-designed code base that considers expandability/modularity/rigidness of the system. Refactoring is rarely done to improve code. Technical debt rises, possibly to an unsavable degree. - Rigidity encouraged in its way of work/scrum: You're expected to be incrementally working each day. It won't sound good in a status meeting if you say that you spent a day on improving your programming skills in order to do better at work (this is related to the first point) without spending an hour or two on your delivery. - Rewards those who have statistics to show: In the company, metrics is highly a key (since as I said, image is important). Test coverage and learning indices are valued too much, even if though those don't necessarily reflect actual quality of work. Bug fixing is glorified because it can easily be quantified in terms of number of bugs fixed, but promoting good design in software development or code reviews, which could -prevent- bugs in the first place, are not because they cannot really be quantified in the same manner. - Inconsistency: Only occasionally practices what it preaches (e.g. ""quality first"", promoting software design principles and best practices), because of said being deadline and delivery oriented. - Scapegoatism system: if someone can be blamed, he/she/group might be blamed. The unfortunate premise here is that a person/group is expected to be responsible for something that goes wrong, and not necessarily the systems in place at work (e.g. cutthroat way of work as per being deadline and delivery oriented). - Work done can be so tedious yet mentally unrewarding: one can spend a week or two on fixing bugs or working on pre-determined work instead of being able to actively design the system. Even if one is able to ""move up"" in his/her career path and do design/architecture, the existing code base of the particular business line already presents a number of structural problems that one might be left to settle with workarounds suggested by developers, instead of being able to have an ideal design/architecture. One is only partially able to improve as a software developer in doing programming work, and so he/she will need to seek it outside of work during his own free time. - Trainings: Too much time is spent on mandatory trainings that are not always relevant to the developers (trainings such as that relating to company culture). Programming trainings, on the other hand, are subpar because the management would prefer to have the bulk of time allocated for actual implementation of deliverables. Trainers who are pressed for meeting deliverable deadlines are, thus, only able to churn out lecture slides that they read out for the most part, promoting passive learning. - Overtimes: The pressure to deliver makes people overtime even when the management does not ask for it. And when they actually do, they might end up prying on your reasons for not being able to do overtime. - Not much extra-curriculars: This is probably due to both time priority being given to meeting deadlines and budget not being allocated for such activities all that much (delivery-oriented). The burden of making time and money for extra-curriculars becomes the employees’ burden. - Food sold at the pantry is so-so, with little variety. THE NEUTRAL (depends on you) = Pay will only scale well if you’re able to prove through metrics that you’re essential to the company, and that task will come with the challenges presented in writing above. = Little work variety: Regardless of role and unless you’re in upper management, you'll probably still be working on the same project, over and over, dealing with the same concepts in different configurations and permutations. This could last for years. May not be everyone's cup of tea. That said... = Work output is rarely tangible: Unless you've reached the point/target year where your product has already been released, you won't have anything tangible to be proud of. No showing your family/friends how cool your new, little Play Store app is. You're almost never going to be able to brag along the lines of ""I made that."" = Market of your product limited by social class: When the time comes that your product is released, only those who can afford will be able to use it. It's not that cool Play Store app that everyone with a gadget can download or voluntarily donate money to. = Time flexibility isn't really so flexible: This may also not be specific to just Nokia, but your free time is affected by the consciously/subconsciously encouraged mid-shift working hours. While the reasons why people come to the office a bit late (10 AM, or even beyond) is complex and not simply company-rooted, this nature of the schedule is also influenced by how one needs to interact with counterparts around the globe (especially in Europe, who are 6 hours behind Philippine time). = Need to study telecommunications apart from actually implementing code, doing architecture, etc: You're encouraged to spend significant time studying, and yet there is little time to thoroughly do so because of deliverables. = Little practicality of non-programming, technical concepts outside Nokia: If you're not for embracing telecommunications and network engineering concepts with all your heart, it's not the company for you. Maybe 75-90% of what you learn won't be usable for other IT companies that aren't TelCo. Add this with the fact that you're also not much mentally rewarded on the software development aspect. = Constant interaction necessary: Because of the incremental style of work, you may also be required to talk to people everyday. If you're an introvert or looking for variety between your days, I doubt you'd like this kind of constancy. = Open office environment may not be for everyone. Depends on your style. Unfortunately, it's hard to consciously be alone because of said need to interact to deliver requirements to proper spec.

I feel comfortable to express my opinions (often critical but in good faith) in front of direct/senior management. I have the chance to influence and receive consistent autonomy and support to take initiative to use available resources in improving HR for the better. 4. I see my career growing in this company. On a daily basis, I have the chance to continuously learn about both telecom industry and Talent Acquisition, collaborate with people from all over the world etc. 5. I enjoy a solid compensation& benefits package, great office facilities (gym, sauna etc..), a flexible schedule, possibility to join the employee share plan etc.
","1. Similar to other companies on the market, HR professionals represent “the rules"". We are often seen as technocrats or policy wonks by both line managers and employees. 2. There is no solid learning& development program to improve the business acumen of the HR community. 3. Fast-changing challenging environment and high work volumes in the Talent Acquisition team.

","Job was (over)sold as a linux admin job and it's not. Most of the work is application support, creating accounts, standard copypaste scripts. Nothing out of the ordinary. Unlike other sysadmin jobs you don't have to work with lower level parts (eg. server hardware, storage, esxi, vcenter). There's A LOT of KPI's and report to be done and very little technical stuff. If you are coming as an L2/L3 linux admin, this you should ask yourself first if you want to further develop you skills or if you want an easy and cosy job with little career growth oportunities. Another thing to have in mind is that even if you get hired, that doesn't mean that you have a project to work on. Usually after a project is contracted by the company it can take a few months (even up to one year) until you can actually connect to a server and start working on operations. During this time there's a lot of training. Most of it being useless or very boring.

Perhaps the best is the flexible benefits package that was brought over from the Alcatel-Lucent acquisition. There was excellent location flexibility, but this is being slowly eroded. Externally, a recognizable brand that opens doors, albeit for the wrong things [handsets, which Nokia doesn't make anymore]. There are opportunities to move abroad.
","This is a very strange company, that focuses on the wrong things. Most senior management is of very questionable quality, with limited gravitas and ability to motivate. The least inspiring management team I have ever seen. This is a chaotic company, but one that thrives on processes and bureaucracy for their own sake - there are many people in back-office function that provide little value, whilst front line sales and marketing is continually cut. Nokia's culture is passive aggressive and will attempt to bully its employees to meet fictional, and often pointless, goals. It is truly awful.

From my perspective, a machine that only offers the product without giving you the recipient could be better. I mean, we could save resources by using real glasses or cups.

Unfortunately this behavior is visible on the SW quality and milestones also which got noticed by the customers and causes many dissatisfaction.

Your experience will vary a Lot depending on where you work. I'm only familiar with a part of Nokia that develops networking equipment. The culture of this group is very different from the rest of the company. The group originally was formed by f-Alcatel purchase of a Silicon Valley start-up, so many people has done one+ start-ups and consequently the culture reflects it.
","It's important to read Pros. Cons - you are a part of a very large company. If you're a superstar, it might not hurt you, but if you're ""just a great above expectations employee"", you might face with the fact that in order to increase xxx (whatever you want to increase), you'll have to look elsewhere. The pros - your paycheck comes regularly. The cons - it is hard to get anything special related to compensation because if your business/your role is doing great, there is certainly another business within such large company that is doing poorly.

","- Low paid employees are never corrected on their own unless they keep asking for it. In other words, don't expect the managers to appreciate your good work to correct your low compensation year-on-year. - Too many senior professionals have made this organisation as their retirement plan and have completely lost the technical touch to stay afloat in this fast technology-driven age. - Managers primarily try to ""make more people happy"" instead of ""make deserved people more happy"" which could motivate the latter group. This makes always the better lot to leave the company eventually after some time leaving behind only the lazy lot. - Although there is a well-defined structure for Internal Job Market (IJM, as mentioned in the pro's section, but, it is almost never experienced transparently. Too much of behind-the-curtain manipulation and politics done by managers for an aspiring candidate. It makes the IJM experience an event to forget for most of the candidates.

My coworkers were really nice. The company generously invests in training. Nokia reflects the Finnish way of life where work life balance is very strongly respected, employee benefits are solid including a 401 k match and generous PTO. I loved the work and being at Nokia and the company consistently lived up to its values. I left Nokia after a round of layoffs but I would return if the opportunity presents again.
","Cash comp was on the lower side and equity was not impressive but there were several other perks (like PTO, 401k match, work life balance) that sort of made up some of the shortcomings. Overall Nokia is still finding its feet after the collapse of its mobile phone business. The mobile networks business while sizable is too cyclical and low margin mostly due to overwhelming opex costs. I also feel Nokia for its revenue and market cap size has a significantly large (>100k) employee base which will continue to hinder the company’s resurgence as a solid and nimble competitor to Chinese and American counterparts. The management is quite unsure and fickle minded about the business beyond mobile networks like software and consumer. So there is a lot of “one step forward and two steps back” initiatives that go around like the Ozo, Digital Health etc.

Excellent benefits such as a strong employee training program that is continuously adding the newest resources have made it a good place to invest my career capital. The company takes diversity and ethics seriously in my experience. Work-life balance is good - when you're at work, you work hard, but you get to use your ample vacation benefits. Some companies talk about work-life balance but create a judgmental atmosphere around using vacation. Nokia isn't like that. It recognizes that you drive yourself hard when you're at work and that kind of effort requires some down-time in the form of paid time off. Senior leadership has high expectations, as it should, but it also seems sympathetic to employees and wants to see us develop and be successful.
","The telecom industry is undergoing challenging times, and this has impacted Nokia, Ericsson, Cisco, Huawei and many other companies. Staffing can be tight on some projects. But in my experience, managers try to prioritize rather than engage in death marches. In my area, it's common for some overtime to be required, but that's true in the industry as a whole.

","Unfortunately, anything outside of mobile is riddled by x Alcatel and Nortel people in middle to top management roles. The Company tries to recruit new blood but after3 years most have left due to the poor cliquey technical sales management, who frankly do not have a clue. They know how to manage up but not run business and engage the field facing sales staff.

So you work with a virtual team in a different TZ than do not understand well the local language customs, customers. The company will survive as there is not much competition left and mistakenly the EU thinks Nokia is still European but that boat left with most staff now in India or USA.

Business Outlook
Pros
Still allowing telecommuting. Hands off approach of the best of Alcatel-Lucent, allowing the profitable parts to run independently. Removed Franco-based management from continuing to make poor decisions. Strong middle-management support allowing local areas to support their projects. Much better than the Chinese players in this space.
Cons
Although still allowing telecommuting, the merged company does not really understand the needs of telecommuters. IT is a joke, it is outsources to DXC (formerly HPE). I swear they use them to force employees to learn as much as possible to support their own IT infrastructure needs. Although no longer French, the Euro mentality still reigns at C level management and down to upper management. They really should learn some lessons from the best of the Americas and Asia. Always focusing on lowest cost at the expense of value to both the company and customers.

Project deadlines are getting shorter and shorter while people are leaving, this puts even more pressure on those that remain. Outlook of the whole telecom industry is not so good nowadays. After 7-8 years when you reach job grade 9 and you don't want to give up on programming you have absolutely no way to further develop and/or get any raise. People become too specialized in a field and have no means to get out. Best to leave between 3-6 years, otherwise you will get burnt out.

2017-09-14, Customer Support Engineer,Alfragide,"Former Employee, more than 3 years",Nokia Alfragide - Bad start for your career,"- Take you time to learn on your own pace. You'll only start to do prevention 24x7 if you feel OK to it. - International environment where you meet and talk with people from everywhere in the world. - very good salary for first job, but you can't expect that it will change in the future as much you work hard - the open space building is very nice - low volume of work to do. It could be a bad thing since you won't be pushed and won't feel pressed to learn more. - you get a parking lot place after a year or so after you start working here, since a lot of people leave the job after 2-4 years. - Canteen with a good variety in the menu: Vegetarian, Mediterranean food, stakes, fish, deserts, fruits, soups and a bar. In the NOC/GDC building a bar with coffee machines, chocolate and sandwich machines, microwaves, tables if you want to bring food from home. - Equality in the job. You see people of all races, gender and ages. Good culture and values. - Flexible work time
","- Your first job after you conclude your Degree will define your future, and working for Nokia-Alfragide will bury it. This company is only for starters that couldn't find another opportunity. - The knowledge gained here is very low and no other telecom company will hire you because you worked for Nokia. Remember you are the first line of support, so they don't expect that you gain deep knowledge. - They hire people from high schools and technicians with no degree to do the same job as you do, that took for you 3 or 5 years to take, so they won't give you any value or advantage to have one degree. - This GDC/NOC is intended to be a first line of support like a call center or help desk, so they don't give you advanced training, superficial training only. - There are no career advance, you'll earn always the same thing. - The lab is very poor, most of times the only contact with the network elements will be remotely at customer's equipment. - Most of the technologies you work here are phased-out, so the knowledge you learn here will be trowed to the trash soon. - Due to the constant restructure and fusion and divorce (Nokia Siemens Networks, Nokia Solutions Networks, Nokia Networks, Nokia-Alcatel) this company is a mess - The line managers are so much incompetent and do nothing. In most of the teams there aren't team meetings or audits, so no feedback on your work and you are by your own here . - Here you are a number and don't feel that you have a value to the company. - Don't expect any help from teammates since they also don't know anything or don't want to tell and you'll have to rely on higher layers of support (from other countries) in the standard process of support. - slow computers that kills your performance - your eyes will suffer if your desk is near a window or in a place with poor illumination - no compensation, no benefits. You work at night in the prevention and you aren't payed, they tell you to take a rest at the day.

As a large company that is present in nearly every country there are many opportunities to advance careers internally, and the variety of roles available is wide. while not cutting edge in terms of technology use, and immature in use of best practices like Agile development, lean sigma six etc there is a good focus on execution and quality. If you put the time in it can be easy to build your own internal network, and generally other employees are supportive, and welcoming.
","As with any large multinational it can be a very frustrating environment with projects often answering to multiple managers which slows progress down. Decision making takes way too long, often due to the number of steering boards and stakeholders involved Internal politics are reducing, but very slowly Commitment to change to become a leader rather than a follower is only on paper, not in reality. For a company that has consistently changed it's focus over the last 150yr it now seems to be afraid of transformation Shareholders are still the most important party, not customers or employees.

","Since 2005: Chaotic redundancy programme that shed great people every year. Challenged managers focused on saving their jobs and many other things. Challenging people: Lacking transparency. Challenging salaries - approx 40% below industry norm for my role. Fact. New starters are attracted by initially good salaries which don't keep up with times. The longer you work there, the more you miss a proper job, New company still run by same non-banker CEO. He has been there more than 7 years. You read the reports and form your own conclusions. Final salary pension scheme was scrapped. This killed the souls of great Nokians. Canteen closed, all vending machines became chargeable, fuel cards stopped to new employees.

This helped a lot to recover the situation and now Nokia is an healthy company, investing to grow again in its business. If you want an experience in a really global organization, where you'll work with people around the world seamlessly, and you have technical TLC expertise, Nokia can be an interesting place to work.
","This obsession for control it's frustrating for me, and I believe it's draining the vitality from people. I don't see happiness around me, just people resigned that this is life and I've to accept it. Managers remember to people to smile and say hello to colleagues, is this something that needs to be reminded? Most of the time I smile when I meet a colleague and in some cases I'm asked ""Why are you smiling?"". Nokia it's a company made of androids, starting from the CEO who is not meeting people, just sending few messages during the year via e-mail or a video saying how we have to behave. Is he a real person? Moreover, Nokia is a company that is shrinking year over year by 10% on average.

Project management is awful. Don't understand any technical stuff and only cares about timelines.They can make your life hell, they will call you at odd hours , they don't care whether you are in hospital or in funeral. They yield more powers than your manager. Quality of products are degrading because of the workload and the deadlines and the pressure created by the project management to meet them. If you are working good they will keep on assigning more work to you until I becomes impossible for you to handle. You won't find a single day where you can relax a bit and sit somewhere for half an hour and have tea or coffee, they will immediately call you. Work load is increasing as lot of people are leaving and the company is not recruiting experienced people to fill the void. There is not much benefits for employees, no free cabs or meals or even snacks. Monetary awards also has been cancelled only certain points based merchandise system is there which is not very useful. Lot of useless meetings. Lot of dependency in works but your manager or project managers won't understand this, they expect you to do everything.They expect you to call others wake others from sleep or contact them while they are in emergency and get you unblocked in your work, if you can't do that it's your responsibility. Lot of companies are offering more package nowadays with much lesser workload. The management can only consider increasing your pay if you put down your papers,. Otherwise they won't care much about normalising the salaries of old employees with newer recruits, there is a huge difference in salary between them.
