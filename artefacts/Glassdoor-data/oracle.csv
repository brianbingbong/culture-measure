2021-09-30, Business Development Representative,"Dublin, Dublin","Former Employee, more than 1 year",Good introduction to Software sales.,"There was very good access to training and further education. There were good progression opportunities, with well-defined paths for moving into more senior roles (However you had to wait x amount of months before you could progress again). You also get to work alongside some very competent and fun colleagues.

Compensation wasn't great but they did have fantastic benefits including health insurance and generous pension contributions.
","When I was there the company was making a lot of structural changes which meant day-to-day work was quite disorganized. There were so many acquisitions it was hard to fully grasp what products did and how to position them. They had a big hiring push so everyone's territories were squeezed and sales targets for most were often unrealistic. Pay scales and progression were very rigid so you had to follow the well-beaten path rather than having options open up if you were performing well.

2021-09-29, PMTS Software Development Engineer,"Redwood Shores, CA","Former Employee, more than 10 years",The long haul at Oracle and lessons learned.,"Tools Team can lead to interesting work sometimes. Good people. Good stepping stone job.
","Hired at Market value but you fall behind and there is no reasonable path to catch up. Management (all the way up to my VP) were powerless and could do nothing to help even if they wanted to. I calculated my pay deficit over 21 years, assuming I was hired at market value, and compared what I could have made if I stayed at market value (for example, by jumping companies as soon as I fell behind) vs. what I actually made at Oracle. 21 years of starting at market that diminished to a 38% of market value resulted in a heart-breaking $1.8 million loss in pay. A hard lesson to learn.

Long periods of stagnation in title/role, even when you perform at a higher level for years. I've been a PMTS for 14 years even though I've been performing at the next level the last 5-6 years.

I averaged 12-16 hour days over 21 years.
Advice to Management
Value employees over profit. In this culture, employee loyalty is worthless. When an employee is making 38% of what you hire new people doing the same work to do, and you tell the person that the only (mildly possible) way to get up to market pay is to show a competing offer from a different company, there is something very wrong with your system. I don't know any employee at Oracle that would stay after getting a competing offer at market value (just to fall behind again as soon as market value exceeds your current pay).

Pros
Decent pay for starting out, lots of young people so it was like being in college. Probably the most fun place I will ever work.
Cons
Their strategy was poor. I spent 3 years across 4 roles in Oracle and the real upper management thought you could sell complex financial systems that are business critical and can take a couple of years to migrate to by cold calling CFOs of 400M+ annual revenue. They did go through a big change after I left so maybe this has been fixed.
Advice to Management
Stop focusing solely on KPIs. For almost all of us, the days became a box ticking exercise to keep management off our backs. A lot of people spent many years working there without selling anything, just ticking boxes and getting more and more depressed.

2021-09-16, Associate Applications Developer,Bangalore,"Current Employee, less than 1 year",Speaking for OFSS. A company equally good and bad.,"Brand value definitely is the top pro(for this reason alone you can take OFSS over other noname company paying say 1-2 lakh more).
If you are lucky you might get good work(spring-boot/microservices).
what they quote is what you get in hand.
Good worklife balance especially for developers.
Job security. Perfect company for retirement.
Overtime pay is there.
Good people mostly.
","The chance that you will end up with legacy software written in PL/SQL. I did. (If that is the case then use your brand value and skills to get out within a year or so, or if you plan on staying do change your team).
Pay is not competitive, even if you compare with Oracle India, OFSS in my time payed around 2-3 lakhs lesser, though if you are from IIT you can get packages above 15 lpa. For developers bonus is not timely, stocks are not given though you can opt for oracle ESPP. Consultants get timely bonus but their base pay is lesser. Also consultants have more work load.
I had even heard of dry promotions, you get promoted without a hike. One guy I knew was also in same position for 5 years, higher management was not ready for his promotion due to his role being lesser even though he was a developer.
Advice to Management
Pay needs to be more competitive else people will leave. Make OFSS pay at least on par with Oracle India pay. Please try to give timely hikes and bonuses.

Pay your tenured people better. There is no reason why a new hire is making nearly 30k more a year than an employee with the same job title who was hired several years prior. Ultimately I believe this is why people leave. It's not a secret that new hire pay increases regularly while current employee pay is stagnant.

-pressure for billability and nothing more
-NetSuite is being sold to customers like hot cakes, but the implementation cannot be sustained at the same pace
-there is no ""you do what you can"" attitude. If you cannot solve an issue, you must seek help and, if an experienced consultant is available only in a few days, it is still your fault

Pros
Onsite for some projects.
Between the projects, you get my time to manage/focus on your life, which is good in order to manage your personal life along with work.
Cons
Top management is full of functional people, they never value the techies, and not much scope in learning and growing for technical guys.
A closed set of techs and tools are used which is specific to Oracle only.
It's very hard to switch after staying 4-5 years in OFSS, as not much organization using their tools and there are no processes to follow and learn market standards.

2021-08-31, Senior Strategic Customer Success Manager,"New York, NY","Current Employee, more than 10 years",My review after almost 20 years in Oracle. Read before applying or accepting an offer.,"Money, work life balance, great ""part-time"" job, benefits.
","Cons
Thanks for taking the time to read my review. I have been with Oracle for over a decade. I write this to give potential candidates a real look into the company. Someone who has been with the company 12-24 months may not have a very wide view since you are required to stay in a position for a year and people rarely leave their area. I have worked in several different areas in my time at the company. I came on as part of an acquisition. You will see folks who give good ratings and approve of the CEO, but it’s really good to check to see how long they’ve been there as Oracle will not show all their cards up front. That typically doesn’t happen until you’re in there a few years. Good Luck! 

Training & Development – In my almost 20 years here, I have never witnessed any dedicated employee development. Part of management's job is to develop their employees, but that is completely non-existent. In the Global Business Units (GBU's) it's even worse. Oracle's latest “employee development” program literally has employees filling out word docs about their goals and such. Basically what people did in 1999. As for actual training, for the courses someone might need to improve in their jobs or become more skills, Oracle will charge you thousands of dollars to take them. In my years here, I had one training course that my unit paid for. With the advent of the cloud, you are able to get access to subscription learning. These are setup as videos for the most part, so you're just watching powerpoint slides go by and once you're done, there's no real reinforcement. In my time here I have not watched one person be developed from a hire to employee to management. Usually in a decade you would have one or two examples of progression. 

Salaries & Raises – I know of a person who was recently asked to transfer teams, but they originally thought it was a promotion and then told it was not. The person transferred teams and then was asked to apply for the position. The departments are basically doing anything underhanded they can to save money and they do not care if people leave. People are leaving my unit in droves. There is a ton of managers who are just flat out leading people on. And as many have mentioned here, the lowest in the industry. If you are considering this company as a place of employment, negotiate as high as you can. In our unit of thousands of people, there have been people who have not even gotten a cost of living raise in 5-10 years. Managers, as well as directors, are pretty spineless and won’t stick up for anyone. I have watched people get lied to about money, I have watched colleagues be sold one job and think they were getting their “level” raise only for the manager to remove the job and create another job that was a lateral move. You are around some really scummy low down people. This is not like the big and successful tech companies. This is basically the lowest end of tech. With that being said, you need to do something remarkable to get any type of raise. You need to really beat everyone on your team and basically be perfect for 12 months. And even then, quite the stretch. And they’ll tell you, “that’s all we could get from management. Be happy you got anything at all.” I have heard directly from someone who was protected that when they contacted HR about the “promotion” that actually had them making less money, the HR person said, “you should just be happy you got a promotion.” Management that are friends with other managers will also have an impact on those things. I have gotten raises in my time here, but with salaries being so low, it's not a lot. As mentioned before, if you get in via an acquisition, you could get a nice bump from what you were making, but that's up for negotiation between Oracle and the old company. 

Work-Life Balance – The single reason I have heard anyone stays here is because they can work from home and get their work done in 4-5 hours a day. That's really the biggest benefit of the company and don't think anyone would argue. 

Management – Lead with talent and qualifications and not who your buddy was at a partner/acquisition/high school/pre school. There are many thick and useless layers of management. Many of them with very little technology and or real IT experience. When Oracle acquires smaller companies, if they are under the GBU framework, the company can basically say, a janitor is now a Senior Director and no questions are asked. I have watched scores of people come in that way and just leapfrog over people who have been in the unit for decades. It's even more embarrassing when the people who have been there basically know 10 times more about everything and the new member of management just sits around being social and not really contributing. I've also never seen the same members of management sit in the same exact positions for decades. These managers stay in office longer than presidents. Their attitudes are smug and many are downright hated by their team members. The thing is, you work in a tech company and you should know the buzz words or at least know what they mean. I have been in meetings where a director actually said to someone two levels below them that, “that's not their job to know how to do this or that...that's on you to know...” At Oracle, as opposed to many other companies I have worked at, to be in management, you do not need to have been good at any one particular job or the jobs of your team. It is truly amazing. My thought is they stay because no companies really want them. 

The Cloud – applications on the cloud were deployed with very little strategy or education to the employees. They will never catch the other tech companies that are staffed with better talent and management. Management wants to tout the cloud as being a success, but it's basically because customers are basically strong-armed into going to it and they are flat out lied to when speaking about the overall performance of the cloud. There is also a mentality among management and long time employees that Oracle is better than Amazon. Anyone who knows the tech sector right now, knows that's laughable. At Oracle, they can't even speak about their competition because they're getting beaten so bad. What's worse is that there are smaller companies that are now coming up that have better products, better platforms, cheaper price and less problems.
Advice to Management
- Start being moral and ethical. It's 2021 and social media is huge. There are forums that are filled with anonymous reviews of Oracle and even people by name who work there. Remember your legacy are your people. 
- Turnover all levels of management. Managers should not be in the same positions for decades as it gives a perception of stagnation. If they can't do the job of the people they manage, they don't deserve to be manager. 
- Educate sales people on what they're actually selling prior to letting them sell. Make sales aware of what other groups are doing. 
- Develop and promote the people who strive to learn and grow instead of people who come in the back door who haven't proven themselves to anyone. 
- Going to have to increase salaries to keep top talent to compete with the real winners in tech space.
- Things need to change!!

Repor","- Start being moral and ethical. It's 2021 and social media is huge. There are forums that are filled with anonymous reviews of Oracle and even people by name who work there. Remember your legacy are your people. 
- Turnover all levels of management. Managers should not be in the same positions for decades as it gives a perception of stagnation. If they can't do the job of the people they manage, they don't deserve to be manager. 
- Educate sales people on what they're actually selling prior to letting them sell. Make sales aware of what other groups are doing. 
- Develop and promote the people who strive to learn and grow instead of people who come in the back door who haven't proven themselves to anyone. 
- Going to have to increase salaries to keep top talent to compete with the real winners in tech space.
- Things need to change!!

Pros
- Excellent training for someone who is looking for a longterm sales career
- Amazing opportunity to meet like-minded individuals, especially if you are fresh out of college and in a new city. The Class Of program sets you up well to make friends
- Great opportunity to learn and grow at an established company
Cons
If you're not interested in pursuing sales longterm, it's challenging to pivot the business development path into something else.

2021-08-31, Director,Hyderābād,"Former Employee, more than 8 years",Great work-life balance; Dated stack but trying to modernize,"If it were not for being far behind the salary curve, a great company where one can even retire at.
Great work-life balance.
A lot of freedom as to how you choose to work.
Stack is old but the company is trying to transform, so one can start getting good opportunities in some teams.
There are some very talented team members who you can be proud of! These same people go to other companies for greener pastures and do wonders there too.
","The biggest drawback is salary. One may join at a reasonable level but one tends to fall behind as one spends time here.

Improve the brand which has become tarnished because of behind-the-market salary levels.

Maintain a consistent frontline sales force. To much turnover and inconsistency with mid-management and frontline sales, which leads to client confusion accordingly. Make it easier for the front line folks to sell (clients can't wait weeks for a demo of the solution)

Attainment isn’t based on actual dollars closed, so you can have terrible sales people seen as stars and shinning examples because of favors done for AEs.

No work from home benefits in over a year or employment, there were talks of getting a chair for months but that never happened.
Advice to Management
Quit and hire some diversity if you’re serious about the change we have talks about once every other quarter.

2021-08-16, Technical Support Analyst,"Lehi, UT","Former Employee, more than 1 year","Poor Management, Abysmal Training, No Support","Pay and benefits are decent, Unlimited Sick Time, Decent vacation/holiday, No overtime. there are some great people here who are really kind and helpful.
","There were people who told me they didn't dare to use their sick time because their manager would get so upset. Sometimes overtime is needed but even then they won't approve it unless it is a critical situation, and what you and I consider critical and what the customers consider critical usually doesn't fit the criteria. The situation has to be at catastrophic levels before such things are approved. 

The training really is terrible. I was told by my friend not to worry about it, that 'you will learn your job when you do your job'. Not even that was true. Everyone I knew was frustrated, with few exceptions. I asked one gal how she knew what she was doing, as she was helping me, and she said she had a degree in databases. Those that know what they are doing were spread so thin.

From what I saw they really don't care about their customers. I could spend an hour writing up a bug and then another hour going over it with my mentor. He knew what he was doing, but told me, yeah, they're still going to ____ and say it's not good enough. That was typical. Once in a meeting, two weeks after I had filed a bug, the developer discussed it with me and I had to explain to him what was wrong and why it was important to the customer. All of this I had written in the bug but he hadn't even read it. I also asked him for an ETA on a bug and he never replied. I asked in the bug, I asked by email, he just ghosted me. I even sent a message to his manager. No luck. I was floored by the lack of concern for a customer, especially as we went through five one hour sessions to train us to bend over backwards for them. On top of this, I eventually found an ETA listed in the bug and told the customer, and the developer chastised me very sternly for doing this. I tried to ask him how I was supposed to talk to him and get an ETA and he avoided the question by chastising me more - basically gaslighting me for trying to help a customer. 

So much of the documentation is incomplete. If you've never used the system before it's impossible to navigate from the instructions given. So much of my time was wasted trying to accomplish step 3 in a list of directions when it should have been step 4 or 5. At that there were very few people I could ask questions of. My manager encouraged my mentor to shut me out unless it was our scheduled call. She told me I was expected to train myself. To me there is no excuse for this. Even with customizations, the documentation should be at or near complete, in many cases it was nonexistent and sometimes google was better than our knowledge base. It was so frustrated because I went in ready to work hard and learn, and help customers. I have been a rock star at this type of work in other positions but with no support I was just frustrated. I tried to document whatever I could so others could learn, but I could only learn what others were willing to teach me, or what I could glean from other SRs and incomplete documentation. Everyone is spread so thin - and then they laid a bunch of us off because we only had 11 service requests at a time. A lot of the verbiage in the documentation was also very hard to read because Oracle hires a lot of non-native speakers, so adding that into having it incomplete just added to my frustration, but the biggest shock to me was the attitude towards the customers. I told a senior engineer that a situation was embarrassing and he told me that if I was embarrassed about that I would be embarrassed all the time. Well, yes, I was until I just had to take the 'not my circus, not my monkeys' approach. But I would have loved to be able to take some ownership and have that matter. That's what I set out to do but was thwarted at every turn. Try as I might, I couldn't learn much, couldn't change much and couldn't help much, and that was demoralizing as I've always prided myself on having the customer's back, as well of that of my teammates, but at Oracle, nobody had mine. 

I'll just mention too that having to drive into the office and getting sick because others were sick was silly. Most of the people I needed to interact with were in other offices across the country, so I was just sitting there with people who couldn't help me.

Another frustration was that a manager there would always look at me like I was disgusting if I didn't wear makeup. If I had dressed up and looked gorgeous she was fine but if I wasn't, she would make a face like I had just puked or something. It was really humiliating. 

My manager admitted that she can be a _____ sometimes, like she was not ashamed of it. Unfortunately I was on the receiving end of that and HR knows all about it. They tried to put the blame on me, but I helped them see reason, at least enough that while they said they wanted to continue our discussions, they never scheduled another meeting.

I've since heard that my team was very overloaded and many of them have left, which is a shame because it takes 3-4 years for a person to get comfortable, from what I am told. 

They also said one of senior management was asking if they were all helping each other to get their queues down. I think most people can understand that if each rep has 96 service requests at any given time, helping each other is going to do little to reduce that number. If one person has that many, others can help bring it down by sacrificing some work on their own queues, but when it's everyone, it seems pretty juvenile for someone to suggest such a thing, and it makes me think that guy obviously isn't being paid the big bucks because he earned his position. It's their own fault for laying off a bunch of people. There was plenty of work, they need lots of documentation and I was more than willing to do that as much as I could and to update the current documentation. I had hoped when I started and saw the state the documentation was in, that I could update it and make it easy for anyone to follow, but that soon became a pipe dream. I wrote lots of documents, but not near as many as I could have if someone had been willing to train me and if my teammates had not been stretched so thin. Definitely did not anticipate being laid off under these circumstances.

Also about the developers - even my manager said that the developers my team was working with had bad attitudes and were some of the worst she's seen at Oracle.

One more example, everyone talked in generalities. Go tell the customer to do this. In one case a senior engineer told me that and I said okay, I don't know how to do that, I can't find instructions, can you give me navigation steps? He ghosted me. I tried to ask again, still nothing, not ever. Sure enough the customer asked for navigation steps and berated me for not giving them in the first place, but there was nothing I could do. I'm told the customer should have known, but that makes me feel pretty silly asking them to do something I can't. I often learned things by watching the customers during zoom calls, they knew more than I did. So embarrassing.
Advice to Management
Don't tell your customers you really care about them unless everyone internally (especially the developers) really do. I was amazed to see that campaign roll out, then we had the training, and the developers never showed any change in attitude - I wonder if they had that training at all. If they did it did no good.

","Zero transparency, upper management does not know what they are doing, extremely decentralized and fragmented with multiple teams competing to achieve the same thing and not willing to collaborate or share information. Huge lack of transparency with management changes and business objective changes. They will not tell you anything until the end and completely derail or scrape projects you've spent weeks or months working on. You do not see the results of work. They will change your title (a change in work level but not in salary) and tell you that you're going to get a promotion to reflect this change, but will delay to no end. They will convince you they need you and then will let you go at a moment's notice. Absolutely horrific management system. They do not care, there's no motivating factor, there are few team building activities or opportunities, the culture is very ""big red corporate machine"" with absolutely zero concern for people who have worked for them for years. Felt demotivated, deflated, underpaid, unappreciated, and had to fight to be given work and put on projects despite delivering quality work repeatedly (from feedback). Very little help with actual career development, quite stagnant.
Advice to Management
Be open, and transparent. Develop trust and collaborate. You're working for the same company, stop trying to compete doing the same exact thing and wasting resources. Do not give employees false information and hope and then cut them off. Listen and respond. Foster team building activities. Value employees.

Work-life balance is very good with some pressure during releases, but that's common across the software industry.
","Oracle India is different from overall Oracle and is highly dependent on Oracle US for directions and hence the hierarchy is not very successful.
There's a huge salary difference at the same level for cloud and application employees, which is not good for growth and attrition is high in both areas.
There was no one-off allowance for home setup which was given across a lot of other companies.
The other departments like admin, HR, etc. are lull and have a very little say in your work-life which might be good, but it takes long time to get stuff done.

CEO Approval
Business Outlook
Pros
The office atmosphere for this role is very lively and energetic for recent college grads, most of your colleagues will be around the same age as you, making it a smooth transition into working life. The work isn't hard and you get a great work/life balance.
Cons
With any sales role, your soft communication skills will be developed in this role but it's very hard to transition laterally or get promoted into anything even slightly more technical or non-sales. They don't equip you with any valuable technical skills that you can eventually transfer over or grow with.
Advice to Management
Encourage your reports to expand their skill-sets into things that actually technically challenge themselves and stop trying to convince them that every other role out there is ""basically the same thing as sales.""

","This of course depends on the team you get in, but as per my experience, it is hard to make progress through the team structure because there are limited positions open. Basically you cannot climb corporate ladder unless the your superior(team lead, manager) makes some progress and opens his/her position.

2021-08-02, Solutions Engineer,"Austin, TX","Current Employee, more than 3 years",Great Compnay,"I love working here. Lots of tools and resources at our disposal. It's exciting having the opportunity to work for such a large company, which means there are lots of opportunities for movement within.
","No annual salary increases (tied to performance or even small cost of living increases). Kind of a bummer, and honestly pretty surprising when I started. There is also no direct path to grow within your team. I love what I do, but when a Senior level team member left, it seemed to open a spot for advancement (for myself or another member of my team). However, we were informed that since the role wouldn't change all that much from what we do now, Oracle does not provide title changes/promotions within the same team (thought process being it's kind of a lateral move, increased compensation without any real increase in responsibilities). I don't want to have to change teams each time I want to progress in my career.
Advice to Management
Find ways to encourage growth and career progression w/o forcing ICs to have to move to other teams. Sometimes, all we want is a little recognition for longevity, and that will translate into more confidence and better performance.

The benefits are excellent and comprehensive. There’s plenty of opportunity to learn and apply your skills. With a great immediate manager and enough buffer from the ones that manage by f-bombs, it’s a great environment.
","Management can slow things down and tend to get in the way. Many upper level managers/vps clearly haven’t taken the required courses on harassment and micro aggressions (if they have, they’ve learned little). While stock awards are generous to top performers, bonus and raise rounds in recent years pale in comparison to 90s-early 2000/“s. 

The company is overloaded with way too many “customer-care” type people that contribute little but hound those actually doing work for continual status updates. These roles are duplicated across various divisions which makes it even worse. Dealing with these people is by far the most miserable part of the job for me. I’m pretty sure bonuses and raises would still be plentiful if these people weren’t consuming so much payroll.

Product and management placement can be a crapshoot.,"Really great 1st job to have on a resumé out of school. Allowed early advancement opportunities to field rep within 5 years. 

My original manager and organization was great.
","Change. The company is constantly changing organizational strategy and leadership as they reorient to the cloud. Had 4 VPs in 5 years. Mark Hura (Cloud Tech SVP) seems to have a handle on issues and shortcomings.

Lack of goodwill. Years of mistreating customers from shady reps and lack of true support can be difficult to overcome.

Operates as 9 separate companies. Your success and experience solely relies on management and what product you sell. ERP and apps (NetSuite) are market leaders while OCI is last in the market with a lot to overcome.
Advice to Management
Don't prioritize short term sales goals for long term customer goodwill, that has changed somewhat but it might be too late.

Have seen managers with high attrition, immoral sales tactics, and poor management skills not only stick around but get promoted! The old notorious Oracle sales tactics have eroded customer trust and still persist with tenured leaders and managers. Some senior leaders still operate with intimidation and immoral sales tactics (i.e if customer isn't talking to us, audit them).

","Raises are extremely rare. Be prepared to make your starting salary the entirety of your Oracle career. Career path progression is extremely difficult here. Employee satisfaction is at an all time low in the Oracle Advertising org. Nepotism runs rampant and blackballing occurs frequently if you don’t fall in line. Huge lack of diversity.
Advice to Management
Invest in keeping top talent. Dedicate resources, time and money into employee satisfaction. Turnover is so high because employees are miserable and top performers are not compensated or awarded appropriately. On the flip side, there is no accountability when employees under perform consistently for years. Focus needs to be put on improving the toxic culture within the Oracle Advertising org.

2021-07-21, Senior Software Engineer,Barcelona,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",Not for ambitious developers,"Remote work (probably forever).
Ability to do almost nothing without anyone noticing it.
","Impossible to grow for senior developers. There were nothing I could do to grow. Even direct question about it to a manager was left without a response. As a result when you ask for salary raise you need to ""justify"" it. Managers did nothing to keep me (and some other developers/testers) when they saw we were about to leave.
I have very big doubts a quality and consequences in one of the projects. Many things there were done to achieve very short terms goals sacrificing long term goals. From technology perspective it was very easy development (so, will not give anyone real benefits in a CV).
The culture is also broken (it can be different in other teams). Once I directly asked my team members not to share some information to management but at the end it was shared.
Management is not able to change many things that were asked by a team. Most of them came after sprint retrospectives. So, be prepared to stay alone with that.
Promotions from developers or QAs to managers looked very strange. Many team members were unsatisfied with people who was promoted and who wasn't.
Advice to Management
Show your people that they are important, listen to them. Be ready to change many things if it asked.

2021-07-19, Technical Product Manager,,"Current Employee, more than 5 years",Stable company with good benefits; hard to advance; average pay and inconsistent raise structure,"Oracle has been doing well for a while, so the culture in my division has been fairly positive and healthy the whole time I've been there. There are office politics at any job, but it doesn't tend to get in the way of a functioning organization. The benefits are also good - medical, dental, vision, vacation, holidays. These things can always be better, but I think most people are happy with what is offered. In my division of Oracle, everyone has an unlimited PTO setup, and for the most part management has been accommodating and encouraging in getting people to take regular time off. Getting a good manager is always a toss up, but I've been lucky to have been led by multiple experienced, motivated managers who I actually felt cared for my well being and work-life balance.
","Oracle is a huge company, so it is easy to get lost in the shuffle of things. This makes it difficult to standout, and even more difficult to advance in any significant manner. Even when the company does well (and it has for the past few years), the pay is probably more competitive elsewhere. There are no bonuses, and the schedule for raises is nonexistent. Sometimes it is yearly, one time it was about 2.5 years, and apparently your raise has no tie to company performance. I have stayed because I am still advancing, I'm doing something I'm interested in, I'm getting paid fairly for it, and Oracle looks good on a resume for when I do decide to move on. Overall, I realize I am as expendable as anyone else at Oracle, but it really comes down to your more immediate group and whether that is being run the right way. There are lots of middle managers here, so hope you get lucky and get one that cares about you.
Advice to Management
Figure out and communicate a consistent, regular raise scheme. Inconsistent/nonexistent raises and promotions - for people who are totally deserving of them - are going to cause people to quit.

","There are NO filters when it comes to hiring managers. So if you ran out of luck you can end up with a ""boss"" with zero skills for leadership. Worst of all, even if you report this to HR, you would likely not have a resolution.
Also, salary increments are almost non existent, are really rare things and you should ask a very good money BEFORE joining so you can go 3 to 5 years without a raise. It's crazy.

2. Bad Leaderships from a HUB in Malaysia; The VP and Directors are not considerate and do not show empathy towards employees.

5. Besides bad leadership and management, the internal process is very complicating and inconvenience. A new employee has to set up their own laptop, account, profile etc referring to a document on how to set up their own machine. Bad IT support, for an IT company. 
6. Unfortunately Mr. Larry Ellison and Ms. Safra Catz do not realised the hardship the employees suffer and face, especially during the pandemic. While everybody is working from home, there are no consideration of any 'hardship allowance' given to the employees.

2021-07-08, Software Engineer (IC3),"Nashua, NH","Former Employee, more than 5 years",Joining OCI vs being acquired makes all the difference,"* Great technology (even if they discourage employee dogfooding)
* IF you are being hired by Oracle, the starting pay is well-above-average AND you can even negotiate your IC level as part of the hiring process
* OCI makes some attempts at Internet culture (free snacks including limited fresh fruit)
* The education benefit is above-average though it won't pay for your entire degree. If you are on a greenfield project then you will have time to pursue this.
","* IF you are acquired by Oracle (or will be):
** Your out of pocket insurance costs will go way up
** You will be put on-call without additional compensation.
** You will spend years watching your pay scale fall behind the industry... New positions will have a ""pay range"" and you will be underwater.
** You will be given false promises that your project won't be cancelled. They don't mean to lie.
** Technical debt will grow EXPONENTIALLY. Expect a brain drain, additional processes so that all tasks take longer to do. Then ""unfunded mandates"" (like: ""migrate everything from GH to BB"") will cause all the Chef and Ansible to break... and your short term workarounds will become permanent extra work.
** Any work you want to do to improve supporting the produce will need approval. If you get paged at 4AM twice a month, but there's no customer impact, then you are not allowed to fix the issue... even if you promised to put in extra hours to do so. That will just be viewed you're not putting in enough time for the prescribed tasks.

If you are on a legacy project, you will be promised you won't be fired BUT NOT in writing. They will not find a place for you (see the Solaris folks for example). You will be allowed to re-apply for any open job however since your skill set atrophied you won't likely qualify and you will feel out of time applying somewhere else. 

Basically you want to leave Oracle BEFORE change of control. That way if you decide to come back, you don't need to wait the full 2 years that other employees must wait.

Oh, if you're not acquired, I'd recommend a 24-month tour.

PMs have no idea what you do
Extremely customer success/service style job. You are graded on customer success score
Advice to Management
Management needs to have better idea of what their consultants do. They also need to think of different, more appropriate metrics for their consultants - a customer success survey is not a fair representation of what an implementation consultant does

They adapted to a fully remote working environment exceptionally well. Decent pay for an entry level job. You will learn A TON about how to find success in sales. The sales org is growing leaps and bounds and there is a lot of opportunity for advancement.
","Sales org structure changes all the time and without warning. Territories change often which is a symptom of growth but it can be stressful when it seems to happen so suddenly. Hours are supposed to be 8:30-5:30 but realistically if you want to hit quota and have success you will find yourself working extra hours. There is rarely an opportunity to earn overtime pay, although I have in the past on occasion
The job can be tedious after a while and burnout is likely. It’s good to keep in mind that the entry level program leads to better opportunities down the line.

Consider more than number and statistics when deciding the new LOB directions.

2021-06-30, Technical Operations,,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Below average industry pay, horrible culture, but above average benefits","-The benefits are the best I've ever had, with extremely affordable health care, free dental and vision (depending on your plan).
-Seems to be an extremely stable place to work so far
","-Below average pay
-Employee Stock Program is a joke (95% of the purchase price, the industry standard is 85%)
-No bonus
-No raises (unless you're willing to start working off of the clock)
 -Seriously, I've always been a top performer at every place I've ever worked, going above and beyond, but every year I've been here Oracle has rated me as ""Meets Expectations"". I asked my manager about this and he implied that it was because I didn't sacrifice enough of my personal time to help out the company. I'm sorry, but I negotiated this as an hourly job. If you're not approving overtime, then I'm comping my hours.

-Culture. I'll admit that it has gotten a bit better, but you can tell management is seething beneath their smiles. I've seen and heard racist, sexist, and misogynistic acts. I haven't reported them personally, because Oracle literally states in its compliance videos that it can't guarantee any protection for whistle-blowers, and my position in the company makes it impossible to file an anonymous complaint. That said, I've had several co-workers leave and, according to them, they told HR during their exit interviews of what they experienced, and I haven't heard of any repercussions.

-SLT likes to make smarmy jokes about employee questions regarding compensation during quarterly all hands.

-Internal hiring is a joke. Unless you personally know the manager, you're not likely to even get an email stating that they've filled the position.

-Turnover is never-ending. To go longer than a month without someone leaving the team is an anomaly.
Advice to Management
-Do a better job of making your employees feel like you care about them. It's not enough to send out an email every quarter saying ""Hey everybody, we're killing it! We made so much money! Good Job!"" to a bunch of people that won't see a cent of that reflected in their paycheck

-Don't make smarmy comments during all-hands meetings, it sows discontent further amongst us peons
-To tack on to the above, one of THE WORST things I've ever heard out of a VP's mouth is the phrase ""We have this awesome problem of not being able to hire enough people"". Think about that for a second, you have a workforce made up of extremely skilled people, each with their own network of similarly skilled individuals, but your compensation and treatment of your workers is so poor that none of us (or at least almost none of us) would ever vouch for the company. Personally, I've had several people ask me about openings within the company, and my response is ""I wouldn't come here unless I was just starting out my career, re-entering the workforce after a significant gap in employment, or ready to settle down into something easy and stable a few years before retiring""

-If you're not going to institute cost of living raises, at least grant us stock options that vest over a certain amount of time. Every year we don't get a raise is technically a 2% pay cut due to inflation.

-Oh yeah, do a better job of separating SLTs politics from the company name, and stop emailing us from Lanai. Reminding us of your mind-blowing wealth is just compounding the frustration caused by the poor compensation

2021-06-28, Applications Developer,"Manila, Manila, Manila","Former Employee, more than 1 year",They'll burn you out. You'll Only Stay for the Company Name,"- You're working for a top software company so it's nice to have on your resume
- Fair salary (but you're gonna be overworked with no OT pay so not really)
- Good HMO
- They provide good work equipment
- Fun activities when in the office but that was team initiative
","- Boring work. If you expect that you'll be handling Java in this company, high chances that you won't. Most likely you will be dealing with proprietary tech and worst case is even having to rely on a slow IDE on a VM to work on it. Debugging will be a headache because you won't find solutions on google. 
- It starts fine during training but once you're in the project, no work-life balance. There were many times that I did not sleep due to releases AND NO OT PAY.
- Pressure from work will burn you out.

I was lucky enough to be in one where people were nice and I always felt appreciated for the work I've done. And I am very grateful for this.
However, I know people that wouldn't recommend because they worked in a toxic environment with terrible managers. Both can happen, both are true. Depends how lucky you are.
","It's a giant company, so it's very difficult to have closer relationship and to have that family feeling with your colleagues, especially if they are spread all over the world.

Business Outlook
Pros
Depending on which department you are in you can expect interesting work, high-calibre colleagues, great flexibility, and pretty decent benefits.
Cons
There are some pretty burdensome centralized processes that make it difficult at times to get what should be straightforward tasks done efficiently. You may start off with a good salary, but once you're in, no matter how outstanding your contributions, don't expect decent raises. After almost 20 years of work there, with outstanding reviews, I just got a 1.7% raise this year -- the first one in almost five years.
Advice to Management
Don't just tell valued employees you appreciate them -- show them the money! It's disgusting that Larry Elison is worth $100B and you can't see fit to reward and retain excellent employees.

","Management is constantly shifting and priorities constantly changing. If you are not well positioned as things change you will be out regardless of tenure. At least 30-40% of your working time must be oriented to politics. If you are a professional and are not a politically savvy person Oracle may not be the right place for you. Keeping your head down and doing a good job is not enough to get ahead at Oracle.

However if you are a political person, who manages up well, and can handle the work which comes with the position then Oracle is the best place for you to work.
Advice to Management
Until you can manage your people and not manage your boss your group and your tenure is doomed. Put your people first rather than putting yourself first.

2021-06-18, Client Service Representative,,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Absolutely no mobility, top-down exploitative company","The benefits are decent and it was reliable work from home income during the pandemic.
","The role itself is designed to deal with the repercussions of technologically illiterate construction workers being forced to use an Oracle SaaS with a steep learning curve. The expectation is to keep mindlessly answering calls and thanklessly letting customers berate you with their frustrations with the service. Resources are rarely available and questions often get delayed, if any, response from peers. Management generally engages with the team with a positive attitude but gossips amongst themselves. Some managers prefer to find minutiae to penalize reps for instead of addressing larger issues that effect the entire team's workflow and morale. Promotions and raises as a whole are a facade as positions are almost always filled with outside hires. I've worked for several years and taken on several additional responsibilities than my initial job description with no increase in compensation, hoping all of it would amount to upward mobility. Even with glowing recommendations from some managers, team members, and coworkers from peripheral departments, my applications have been fruitless, usually without even a response of interest. After addressing these concerns with management, I was told to wait for more senior reps to have their chance, and to keep thanklessly picking up additional tasks and responsibilities.
Advice to Management
The CEO of this company is the 6th richest man on earth and increased his net worth by an estimated $20 billion over the course of the pandemic. He could give every single employee of this corporation a $150,000 bonus and be just as rich as he was at the beginning of the pandemic. Our department is getting work from home needlessly revoked and will be lucky to have a pizza party for our trouble when we get back in the office.

This job is thanklessly ignored by everyone above it and the corporate ladder is exponentially out of touch. Working for this company shattered a lot of my hopes for my career and keeps my mental health constantly on the floor.

It’s fairly disorganized, like a teenager who still doesn’t know quite what to do but means well and has the idea. I see this as a pro because there is a ton of opportunities to shine if you’re willing to work for it.
","Disorganized and lack of processes on the most critical levels - the everyday stuff. Management has a lot of churn - it’s like the weather in Seattle. If you don’t like it, just wait 5 minutes. 
One of the real cons of this is that when it comes to review time, oops, you barely know your boss. You worked hard for the last one but now they’re gone. Start over, and hope next year someone will recognize your body of work.
Advice to Management
Hire when and where it’s needed! So many dumb mistakes happen with a lack of personnel and / or knowledge. I guarantee it costs more to fix those errors (plus unfixable hits on our reputation) than to just hire enough of the right people. Having a hiring freeze on US hires for a year or so isn’t helpful.

2021-06-16, Applications Sales Manager,"Chicago, IL","Current Employee, more than 8 years",Sales at Oracle,"Innovative company, the best cloud platform in the market, so many resources to help you sell.
","Big company feel. No real focus on employee culture. Too many leadership changes in the last three years especially in HCM applications. Get used to change at the start of every fiscal and about every 3 years highly disruptive change to employees and customers. Not a lot of rigor from leadership team or sales operations to ensure some margin of equity in account assignments. If you don’t get a good territory each fiscal year change, there’s really no appetite from leadership to add or modify account assignments despite what might be communicated. Therefore, use caution when negotiating your base salary and discussing OTE variable earnings. Sometimes it really is the luck of the draw with account assignments and many, many examples of reps not having a realistic opportunity to earn variable based on limited territory size, long sales cycles, etc.
Advice to Management
Take the time to really address the root cause of poor employee satisfaction and higher turnover especially in the field teams.

Pros
Oracle is a great company to start right out of college. It holds a lot of power in the tech world, especially if you are coming in with a non-business/tech background. You learn a lot about technology and business operations on the job.
Cons
The sales department at Oracle is very disorganized. ""The only constant is change"" is the tagline, but seems like an excuse because they can't get things in order. Too many overlaps within territories and too many teams aligned to certain accounts that sometimes it comes at the expense of the customer. This is especially true for the lower/entry level sales jobs outside of the field sales rep.
Advice to Management
Your success and how you feel of the company is very dependent on how well your manager guides you. Sometimes people are great sales reps but it does not make them good managers.

2021-06-14, Product Manager,Bangalore,"Former Employee, more than 5 years",Oracle – The company which values a laptop more than the life of an employee during the corona virus pandemic,"How can Oracle have any pros when it puts an employee at a health risk during the coronavirus pandemic. Shame on you Oracle.
","Firstly, let me say – The HR folks at Oracle have no control of their duties and the VP (My manager) considers himself above all company policies, compliance acts, rules, and regulations. The HR folks are mere puppets who tolerate the whims and fancies of the VP. HR keeps a blind eye as they have no control at all. The VP intervenes in tasks that do not concern his duties and HR allows the VP to do whatever the VP wants. (The VP referred here is my manager) 

Corona Virus pandemic hit us unexpectedly and my wife delivered our first baby when the virus was spreading rapidly. So, we were even more cautious and didn’t step out of the house unless and until it was an emergency ensuring the safety of our newborn child, avoided all travel, and didn’t allow anyone to enter our house in Bangalore. 

I accepted another job offer during the pandemic and I put down my papers by informing my manager who sits at a VP level as mentioned earlier. After I put down my papers, I was told by my manager to coordinate with Mr. X to do the company asset (Laptop and accessories) handover formalities on my last day. I did the same and the company asset handover was finalized with Mr. X to be done at the nearest Oracle premises near my house. I was happy that I had confirmed and finalized the asset submission at the Oracle office which was close to my residence considering the coronavirus situation that was creating havoc in Bangalore and is still creating havoc.

On my second last day at Oracle, my manager informs me that I must submit the company assets to the Oracle office which is very far from my residence, and the reason he states is that he prefers to have all assets in one place. This is even after I had confirmed the asset submission to the Oracle office that was close to my residence and even after I had requested to allow me to submit the company assets to the Oracle office close to my residence due to the corona situation in Bangalore. See the sadist behavior of my manager – He first informs me when I put down my papers to coordinate with X and do the asset handover formalities and on the second last day he intervenes and says to submit to the Oracle office that is far from my residence. The HR folks were just mere spectators, but they didn’t even bother to intervene. 

Every company across the globe is putting its best foot forward to ensure the safety of its employees as its core priority. But Oracle ensured that I am harassed and tortured mentally during the pandemic time. I wonder how such companies and managers can put someone’s life at a risk. Not only that, but my manager also wanted me to go out and exchange my laptop charger with another team member and wanted me to submit my team member's broken charger on my last working day to Oracle. I refused to exchange as I wanted to avoid meeting anyone during the pandemic and, I didn’t want to do any fraudulent activity by submitting a broken company asset back to the company. 

I was mentally harassed and tortured by this incident and I raised the harassment complaint to the top officials including the CEO. I hope the reality of the Corona Virus situation sinks into them and hopefully they realize how difficult it is to face such harassment from sadist managers and incompetent HR folks. 

The HR person who contacted me didn’t even have the courtesy to apologize for what happened and was arrogant when talking to me on such a serious sensitive issue. Instead of focusing on the harassment issue that I raised, they were interested in knowing whether I have a “PROBLEM” with my manager. See how sad their mentality is and how they are handling the harassment issue that I raised. 

I am glad that I resigned from this toxic company which put me and my family at a health risk during this corona virus pandemic. Shame on you Oracle.

Change the culture, and listen more to your staff. Cleanse the entry/mid/upper management, and get rid of those who are toxic. There's so much nepotism and favoritism happening. And surprisingly, there a lot of managers lacking common sense, compassion and respect.

","India Support center Never gives Hikes. India support managers are scared to talk with their US managers. Most managers are head noding for all.

Jeaus bless poor people those who are still believing there is hike and waiting waiting for their pea nuts even after 5 years.

2021-06-02, Cloud Sales Representative,"Los Angeles, CA","Former Employee, more than 1 year",Beware: Prison Sentence,"None that I can think of
","They offer you a high OTE then they make your quota so high you can’t attain it. Then they cap you at 125%. Then, they don’t pay you the other half of your income. Then in the final quarter they make it so you get paid a minimal amount of what was owed to you from your first year’s quota but make you stay until the pay out date or they REFUSE to pay you at all. This company does not pay two week notices FYI. They do not value their employees or treat them well enough to not have a high turnover rate. 

On top of all of this, you will deal with internal oracle issues including but not limited to: CRM crashing, oracle collections harassing your customers, Internal competition, hazing from management, micromanagement, no visibility into install bases, Oracle interfering with deals to make it impossible for you to do your job correctly, demotions as soon as you sign on and honestly yet unfortunately the list goes on. 

Please beware of this company. Take notes that the culture is unbearable and they are evil. Don’t be fooled by the high OTE. Anywhere is better than Oracle by 100000000%. I wouldn’t wish this company on my worst enemy is how bad it was. Absolute torture.
Advice to Management
Fight for your employees to get paid!!! Not everyone can go without a paycheck. 
Don’t micromanage your employees. 
Give feedback!!! Grow your employees. Don’t treat them like numbers. 
Help them if they need it. 
Don’t ruin sales deals for them. 

For VP and higher: Value your employees. Make their quotas attainable. Don’t focus too much on hitting calls when the value of time with a customer is way more Important. 
Don’t let RISE calls talk down to your employees. 
Respect one another
Prorate pay checks until your compensation team can get their stuff together correctly.

Some of the sales team were overbearing and expecting unreasonable results. Very much coin operated. When I told my immediate manager that I was overwhelmed with the volume of work and the certification expectation the response was to suggest that I get up earlier. I left due to stress related depression and have been having counselling ever since.

Advice to Management
Oracle Consulting is supposed to be a place where feedback should be common place and be used to better ourselves. I find it weird that when it comes to promotions, pay raises etc are left out. How am I supposed to improve myself when all my colleagues get promoted but I'm left out. I think its time to stop relying on HR and Finance in determining who gets promoted because they don't know the whole story all they get are sheets of paper. Hardly a human experience which is the antithesis of one of our 5 C's.

Pros
Amazing team, very talented, great team work and highly collaborative. Great work/life balance, unlimited leave, and decent health insurance.
Cons
The company does not really care about keeping or supporting employees. No regular pay raises, or bonuses regardless of personal or professional performance. They are unconcerned about attrition or lose of talent, this stems from over whelming corporate arrogance. This arrogance extends to how the executive leaders treat employees as well, be thankful that you have a job here.
Advice to Management
Oracle is making the transition to being a true cloud provider, you have many strengths and differentiators, but you are late to this game and need to make employees to know they are valued because in this market they have many more options.

Quit being so Quarterly driven and worry more about the customer relationship. Found it very interested that Most customers HATED Oracle during my 5 plus years there.

2. Nothing new is there to explore at Oracle.
3. Salary compensation is not good compared to other big product-based MNCs.

Business Outlook
Pros
Exposure to leading-edge technology, top-notch resources, world-class training
Cons
Absolutely brutal workloads, typically averaging 70 hours/week for a manager. Frequent, unplanned travel which overlapped weekends. Mediocre senior management that demanded more, more, more while constantly taking away resources. Favoritism toward managers with flashy sales personalities regardless of how productive or effective they were as leaders/managers. Over-reliance on 90's-era internal systems to get work done, often requiring 50+ different logins per day.
Advice to Management
Revisit existing business processes that are document-based. Typical sales contract approval process took 3-4 weeks to finalize which often put deals at risk. Overly political management structure protected senior managers from any criticism/feedback resulting in paralysis of middle management making most employees feel like zombies just ""going through the motions"" because no idea/opinion went anywhere.

The Portuguese language team have only 4 people to cover all hotels in Brazil and Portugal. They don't give you training that it will be useful for your work, they will expect you to learn the entire system in one week (Including fiscal rules for the different countries) and will put you in front of computer to get calls straight away with the same goals of the other members of the team who are working there for years. You will work on Christmas, New Years and bank holidays and do not expect any xmas bonus or pay raise. If you are not available to get calls, no matter why, more than one manager will slack you to be available every minute. Many managers from US will shame you sending emails for all the teams around the world, copying all the managers, asking you to be available in the phone even if you already got more than 20 calls and you are about to finish your shift.

Pros
Salary was fine, but there were none of the perks you find at other big tech companies like Facebook or Google--no free snacks, have to pay for the gym onsite, etc. 
You don't have to work very hard as a BDC/sales development representative/whatever they're calling the role nowadays. But you are VERY dependent on your sales rep to ""help"" you find opportunities.
Cons
I wish people had warned me about the fratty culture. Oracle sales purportedly hires ""leaders"", which includes former college athletes, student council members, etc. and ultimately results in a lot of former fraternity/sorority members being hired. The environment is quite literally collegiate, in that all the bonding activities involve drinking and people act like they're still living out their frat-bro days. It doesn't help that they hire in such large batches (I started with 100 people in the Austin office) and with so many people fresh out of college, which leads to the same cliquey-ness and gossip that freshman year of college entailed.
Advice to Management
Stop promoting people who are ""good at sales"" into management positions. Being a good salesperson does not mean you'll be good at management. In fact, it often means the opposite. You can't hound your subordinates into doing better, the way you can hound a customer into buying something or at least taking your call.

It's clear they've gone the way of increasing the top line at all costs, with no consideration to territory size, % of AEs that hit quota, etc..

The team I was on had 8 AEs. 1/8 hit their annual quota. Average quota attainment was >33%. 

Long story short, it's very difficult to hit a big # based on demand and territory sized. They've hired too many people in Sales.

","American based, where they easily forget satellite and remote workers even exist. Large org where managers look to build empires, focusing decisions and solutions on short term gains, and credit is taken for others work. Don't help others in such an organization as there is nothing in it for you, and nothing lasts very long, even good will.
Advice to Management
Lip service is paid to noble goals and initiatives, but they are a farce that doesn't go down even one level of very significant management hierarchies. Management focuses on a few who progress while the rest are left leaving for advancement or resenting the lack of communication and inclusion in decision processes.

Unless you end up in a toxic environment,"Good networking; if you are good, other well established companies will try to head hunt you; possibility to change team/Lob; solid company; they have an office in Malaga, a paradise in terms of quality of life; good products (PaaS and IaaS are becoming to get noticed)
","It seems that senior leaders at Oracle are closing both eyes on bad sales practices. Also, despite all their claims of being against gender discrimination, and wanting to support women, I witnessed several woman that after becoming mum, the senior manager took away the good customers/territories from her, and she does not receive any ""congratulations"" message from the company either (if she is lucky, her manager and co-workers will send it to her).
Targets are really high and far from being achievable (I guess this is the way they keep costs down). Career promotion is unclear (I once saw the partner of a manager being promoted, while other sales reps with better performance were not).
Not saying every manager/director is toxic. Not at all! I had the luxury to meet both types during my several years at Oracle Digital in Malaga. Good luck.

2021-04-30, Tech Account Manager,Amsterdam,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Great school, everything else is horrible","young and great colleagues, good on your CV, good work life balance
","- it's a very hostile environment and everyone works kind of against everyone
- therefore people usually have a bad work attitude and you have to be scared that someone else ""steals"" your deal because they believe it's their account, not yours
- two years ago Oracle decided they now have to be customer centric (after >40 years they finally realized that...), as of now, they are not at all; they keep making the customers' lives hard, even just changing an e-mail address for the customer has to be done by the customer himself and can't be handled internally
- management is a disaster, no people management at all, they don't know how the real business is running, especially VP who has zero contact to the account managers, who do the actual work; no support during corona at all, no equipment, no appearance in team meetings by VP, no understanding, just being told to put books under our laptops...
- no onboarding, all self service only; new hires rely fully on helpful colleagues
- no people management, no development opportunities, no matter how hard you work
- new hires want to leave as soon as possible, waiting for their relocation budget to expire (bound for 1,5 years)
- it depends fully on your customer patch on how much money you make
- customers hate Oracle, no one is happy when you call and they usually had bad experiences with Oracle
- nothing is easy, every process is difficult, even just changing a customer's address
- men get paid more and have higher IC levels
- many people are leaving because there is no opportunities, no support during corona and the only fun thing (going to the office, colleagues) is not really present anymore
- no values

The commission pay looks good on paper, but be careful. You will only receive more than half of that commission if you had a good territory where the is not much internal competition.
","Base salary and benefits are not as good as the rest of the key players in the industry and region.

No career progression. Only way to get promoted is to move to one of the competitors and then move back. Even annual wage increase is not being done.

Internal systems feel like you are working for a poor third-world country's government from how bureaucratic the company is.

","Company has a strange policy, where company don't consider giving salary hike. Appraisal process is never in sync with package increment, both run independently. Local management looks to be helpless and don't have any hold on salary hike. Oracle follows a strange appraisal system where employee needs to get some offer from other company to proves his own worth, even though you perform well and has been appreciated by manager or appraisal system. Employee work for 3 to 4 years without hike but any new joinee filling the same position will be paid huge salary hike compared to his current package. Work life balance all depends upon the Team and manager.

2021-04-27, Director Customer Support,"New York, NY","Former Employee, more than 10 years",Toxic environment - execs do not care about employees,"Benefits seemed good. Access to training on Oracle technologies.
","Oracle tech is not the leading edge and you will lose marketable skills working there. Even in management, there is no career development that will transfer to another company. Raises are few and far between and never touch everyone - high salaries, raises and options/rsu's are reserved for the elite in OCI. Certain high level execs manage through fear and tantrums and have no clue how to run a customer focused enterprise software/cloud services company. OCI managers will often call other teams in Oracle stupid and useless and old and that attitude pervades the organization and is reinforced by the OCI HR - which is a distinct org from regular Oracle HR.
Advice to Management
Get this OCI/Oracle division straightened out and start working like a cohesive company. OCI people are not better than other Oracle employees. Stop treating the company like your own dividend cash machine and start investing in employees and technology. Employees live in fear because that is the environment created by Larry from the top down.

Pros
The people you work with are smart, driven recent grads. Great opportunity to network and make friends with good people. Direct managers are supportive and want you to do well. Oracle is also a good name to have on your resume to find a higher paying job.
Cons
Unfortunately, the way BDCs are treated is not the best. Middle management micromanages and makes every aspect of the job way more difficult than necessary. Pay is lower than what many competitors pay. KPIs are entirely arbitrary to the point where people just make stuff up to rank higher despite not bringing in any value.

","No recognition for achievements, SVP that encourage you to do malpractice activities, threatens you on sundays.
No vision, no mission, the only value and only objective is short term money, regardless of clients needs and common long term business.

Also, for a so called technologie leaders, you should see the stupid processes that we have to go through to get anything done. You spend more time talking to different layers of management and deal with some very user friendly systems than building relationship and selling value & experience to your customer/prospect.

Although lots of very competent IC’s, management is a mix of very good/experienced and terrible toxic counter productive short term personal career oriented “leader”.

Pay attention to your initial négociation, because once accepted you package is likely to evolve very slowly.

Not only you’ll have to perform (obvious) but you’ll also have to deal with complex situation were management is asking you to work for “free” or encourage you to do malpractice activities.

","Awful company culture. Politics are everywhere and good engineering decisions are rarely made based on what is best for the customer. Middle and upper management the worst I have ever experienced who are only focused on their own career and salary. No employee investment in training or career growth
Advice to Management
Your employees are the engine of a company and you have no respect for your employees. You are totally focused on your own personal career and the customer is never even considered.

Pros
- Great workplace to kickoff your career in sales
- Benefits (insurance, extra holidays to purchase, etc.) are great
- Flexibility and lack of constant pressure or micro management
Cons
- Low wages compared to most SDR/BDR tech companies 
- Non defined progression paths 
- Comission calculator doesn't exist: what you get on a quarterly basis can't be calculated in a transparent way. Overachievers sometimes get less bonus than promised
Advice to Management
- Some managers have no previous experience in real sales (account management, new business executives, etc.) which leads to unrealistic advice and coaching. I would advise them to get more sales training that can really help their reps

- Be more upfront and transparent regarding promotions

2021-04-12, Senior Product Manager,"Denver, CO","Current Employee, more than 5 years","Solid Company - Good Worklife Balance, Great Insurance Benefits but Tough to Get Promoted or Salary Increases","These are for Oracle Data Cloud business arm - (Adtech-Martech)

* Collaborative and fun work culture
* Excellent Insurance Benefits
* Excellent Parental Leave - (up to 10 weeks for both parents)
* Flexible Work Schedules - (If you are delivering innovation and value)
* Colleagues in general are smart and helpful
* Great amenities such as gyms, cafeterias , outdoor workspaces
* Vacation is not necessarily tracked.
* Very relaxed work attire requirements unless meeting with clients
","* Very difficult to get raises or promotions so ensure you ask for compensation and title that you expect to have for many years to come when being hired. After seven years of working for ODC, there still does not seem to be an annual review process so even getting standard cost of living raises are difficult.

* Lots of bureaucracy within the product, engineering, and legal teams so very slow or difficult to consistently release products and/or product features. Very difficult to be innovative and keep up with industry competition

* Product leadership and vision seem to change very often. This can impact current projects being worked on and therefore, lot of ""throw-a-away"" work can be expected

* Currently, only one overarching design team so not all product teams have access to working with designers to create innovative and industry leading digital products. Sometimes, product leads have to wear many hats.

* Product leads often have to wear many hats such as designer, UX researcher, market researcher, Product Marketer, Technical Product Manager vs Product Owner, scrum master, project manager, product tester and system troubleshooter / tester. This can lead to some long nights and also impact speed of product releases

* Engineering resources always seem to be limited and not enough for building all the products and platforms leadership wants to build so again, progress can be slow
Advice to Management
* Build a strong and cohesive product organization that puts innovation and speed to market first and foremost. 

* Decrease dependencies on so many teams to release products or features.

* Compensate people aligned to industry averages. 

* Have yearly review processes if, for nothing else, to provide performance feedback if not assess availability for salary increase and/or promotions

","Compensation is broken. Company regularly increases base salary for external applicants but freezes salary for internal employees. Internal transfers are compensated based on their initial salary instead of the new role’s salary range. It’s not uncommon for internal employees to leave Oracle for 12 months and then return as an “external applicant” just to level the playing field. All the top performers leave once they find this out and the bottom of the barrel performers remain. 

Extreme overtime and working conditions (ex: working until 12, 1, 2am and then returning to regular working hours the next morning)
Advice to Management
Wake up and fix the broken comp system at the source, you’re hemorrhaging external salary increases and on boarding costs while losing anyone of actual value.

2021-04-07, Sales Manager,,"Current Employee, more than 5 years","Oracle is an accounting-focused company, not a sales focused comany","Lots of spots to hide out and collect a base. If your idea of ""sales"" is ""Audit Bargain Close"" (google it) and you enjoy parsing through contracts to move the customer spend from one bucket to another, then this is the place for you.

Upward mobility because of high turnover.

You'll also get a big pay bump when you leave.
","Go-to-market is terrible. Over half of reps won't even get to 10% of their number. 90% won't even get to 75% of their number. The outliers who hit their number generally do so when an existing customer naturally expands and the ""Audit Bargain Close"" process ""works"". This low attainment is despite the org itself hitting it's number most quarters. Which, mathematically, means that quotas are over-assigned by 4-6x most years. The solution year after year isn't that Oracle's GTM needs to change, it's that they must have hundreds of bad sales reps, thus the high ""warm body"" churn rates. 

Further disincentives to collaborate, if there is a co-prime, you are cut off at a certain threshold. In other words, you don't want to work a deal ""too big"" or it will get taken away. This leads to poor communication and confusion of the prospect/customer. 

Churn and burn culture with a warm body in place. Oracle treats sales as a cost, not an investment. No incentive to cross sell or collaborate with your co-workers. This leads to a high loss rate to competitors who sell strategically. It also leads to a dishonest work environment in terms of deal collaboration. Close rate is around 10% mind you. 

Oracle rewards Audit Bargain Close and moving a customers spend from one bucket to another and neglects any kind of incentive to find genuine new revenue.

Vast majority of sales managers and even VPs have never sold genuine net new revenue, but got to where they are by the same Audit Bargain Close methodology, reading Oracle contracts to exploit the comp plan, or have managed KPI-based sales ""support orgs"" and somehow moved into managing sales. Thus, they have no real ideas of how to find new revenue. Oracle's revenue hasn't grown in 8 years, so obviously no one is actually selling genuine net new revenue. High customer churn because Oracle would rather pay audit jockeys to screw over customers than hire enough customer success managers.



TL;DR, is this the kind of company you want to ""sell"" for?

Oracle's revenue hasn't grown in 8 years, yet EPS has. High churn and low sales payouts (due to most reps not even remotely getting to their targets despite the org number as a whole being 100%+).

Oracle has been sued multiple times for ""Audit Bargain Close"" sales tactics. This leads to high customer churn because Oracle doesn't understand that modern technology isn't as monolithic or hard to remove as it was in the 90s. 

There is an entire industry dedicated to servicing Oracle customers and protecting them from over usage and being audited.

This is not a sales company, it is a legal/accounting company. It's a shame because the technology itself is world class.
Advice to Management
Treat sales as a revenue center, not a cost center.

Cut the bloated sales ops staff by 60% or pay them based on rep retention/% of reps participating.

Comp people based on genuine net new revenue, not calling a customer and saying ""you're over your usage, pay us"" or convincing a customer to simply re-sign an ordering document under a new SKU name so the rep gets paid without creating any value.

Fire yourself if you got into your position of upper management but haven't carried a bag in 20 years.

100% remote due to Covid-19. Hopefully, this continues. Part of the culture is everyone is willing to help others which is awesome.
Cons
Slow to promote and often promote in groups based on time in a role rather than on production.
Advice to Management
Never promote based on time in a role rather promote based on merit.

Advice to Management
Stop with the ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" type of culture in sales. Creating a structure where in fighting and competition with other peers is encouraged will eventually affect your customers. If you think your customers are as disposable as your sales teams, think again.

2021-04-02, BDC Representative,"Dallas, TX","Former Employee, more than 1 year",Avoid Oracle BDC Org At All Costs,"Having the name on your resume while applying to other jobs... Although that does not seem to carry much weight anymore.
","Not sure if Oracle has bots leaving fake reviews here to cover up the truth about working in the BDC org, but here is the truth: it is the most exploitative sales program out there. They randomly place BDCs into different lines of business, which end up having different pay structures. You will find yourself making more or less than someone who applied to the same role (regardless of performance). They will promise you $25k of performance-based compensation and tell you that you will get it if you hit your number during recruiting. You will end up attaining over 200% of your quota and not make full bonus. They will tell you that you can promote quickly. You will soon find out that ""promotion"" means getting a slightly (and I mean slightly) higher base and new title to do the same job after a year of being a BDC - if you are lucky. The road to the top at Oracle is endless.

Outside of the external competitors (who have far superior products than Oracle) you will also find yourself calling against many other teams within Oracle. This creates many confused and angry clients when you do get them on the phone or email. The training organization neglects giving you a complete understanding of the products you sell, but instead focuses on teaching you how to be manipulative and lie on the phone. The KPI structure for making bonus is nothing but subjective busy work. An ""opp"" does not come down to what you discover at an account, but how lenient your assigned Account Manager is.

In summary, you have no control over your destiny here. I am familiar with the common pitfalls of Corporate America. At Oracle, it is different. Leaving this company was the best decision I could have made. Hopefully this review will help someone make an even better decision of not working here at all.

Health Benefits are great
","Oracle decided to move HQ to Austin, TX which became effective late 2020. It was planned a long time ago so nothing to be angry there. Oracle is backfilling any departures in Austin, TX where possible. TX is employer friendly compared to CA. 

My review is from a non-OCI / non-engineering role -- this might not be applicable to you. Oracle is known for no pay raises. You can google it and it would be the top result. The average length of employees is around 2-3 years because they realized.. wow it is true. Time to find a better paying job. I have seen ex-coworkers get 40% raises by accepting outside jobs. I did the same. 

What's maddening is when I discussed pay with a peer.. I discovered that as a new hire.. I was paid more than him and he had been there 4 years already. Oracle doesn't value talent or loyalty. 

I have seen people request a match to stay but HR would say no. Your management chain will have no power. However, they would hire a total newbie for the pay that the person requested.. Oracle cannot retain talent. On blind -- I have seen someone polled offers between google and Oracle. all the Oracle employees said choose google.. you can chill and get pay raises. lolll it's funny how all oracle employees were on the same page. doesn't look good externally. 

Advice for anyone that wants a raise at Oracle -- apply to another position internally. That's the only way.
Advice to Management
Executive management must evaluate the culture of the company towards their employees. I have seen and heard various organizations lose 15-30% headcount since January 2021 with more in the process of leaving. It would be silly to assume that C-suite haven't realized that they're bleeding more people than usual. Top performers are leaving and it's a pain to ramp new hires in 6 months when fiscal year is about to end. I doubt anyone cares but it's cheaper to keep top performers that can do the task of two ICs than have a churn of employees every 2 years. You lose alot of money in tribal knowledge and hiring. 

When I accepted an outside offer -- at least 4 others asked for help so they can update and job hunt themselves. The floodgates are open and companies are willing to pay 30% for all the employees that you have trained. Oracle needs to pay more and retain their talent to win the cloud war. The ball is in your court.

401k & health Benefits were very good.
","In my experience this was the most Dysfunctional company I've ever worked for. Constant internal fighting for deals and stealing of deals. Other internal teams actively blocking you in accounts. Can't get commission checks right, and forget about base pay raises. Most customers hated Oracle. Typically because they felt they were cheated or abused by Oracle at some point. In my experience, their anger was usually justified. People/recruiters often commented they were surprised how long I'd stayed at Oracle as they have such a bad reputation in the industry. I recommend you look elsewhere for employment, and only consider Oracle as a last resort.

TIP: Go and ask for new work that come. No one is going to know that you are capable unless you tell them.
2. Very Chill People in the team
3. Apply for internal switching to different project and it gives you completely new environment and growth opportunities
4. Good Pay initially (but salary is not increased very often)
","1. Personal Growth and learning can be hindered by your manager as they will expect you to work on only the things they assign and sometimes it doesn't align with your growth
2. HR don't take actions unless higher management gets involved.
3. You have to buy food. No free food available 😭
Advice to Management
See that lower level managers are not creating too much pressure on the developers.
( All I asked was for 1 day leave so that my eye condition gets better. I couldn't even see the screen without getting water from my eyes and they were completely red and was hurting really badly. 
My manager wrote me a very diplomatic e-mail to tell me not to think of taking a leave again as it was impacting her work. My medical condition got worse because of her behaviour and pressure to keep working and eventually I resigned as I will not work for a company who doesn't respect their employees and care about their health.)

Sr. management team should have regular one-one skip level interviews with staff down the structure, and should take their input into serious decision making; A company exists not just for sales and business, but for its people first -- remember one thing: happy employee happy customers.

Lots of opportunities. Very entrepreneurial environment.
Cons
I've you've been there a long time, you will find you're paid well below current market rates. They don't tend to give merit increases, bonuses are almost never paid out at full eligibility. I'm in pre-sales. I remember hearing when I joined ten years ago that the only way to get a pay increase is to leave the company and then come back. Sadly, this is still the truth.

Business Outlook
Pros
-Great opportunity for someone fresh out of college with little experience
-You're starting with a class of 100s of other people around your age, easy to make friends
-Pretty easy to be successful. Most of the class is frat bros/sorority girls who are really there more to socialize and have fun than they are to work. Nothing wrong with that, but if your goal is to be good at your job and make a lot of money you can rank at the top every quarter if you're willing to put in just a little effort. 
-Honestly really good pay for what is essentially a glorified telemarketing job.
Cons
-Job is not fulfilling at all
-Micromanagement
-Lack of transparency, KPIs that don't make sense
-Constant changes, your job is more about fake metrics (# of calls per day, quick tours) than it is actual sales (creating legitimate opportunities)
-Lack of promotion opportunities. A lot of the promotions to move up from BDC look like promotions in title, but actually end up paying less
-Training is lackluster. I personally don't feel like I developed many real skills after my first month or two.
-Experience will be mostly dependent on what team you end up on. It's completely random. Some products are way easier to sell. Some managers are super chill and others will micromanage you to the death and make you want to find another job immediately.

2021-03-19, BDC/OD Sales,"Burlington, MA","Former Employee, more than 3 years",College Graduates/Young Professionals Beware,"I worked at Oracle for 3.5+ years. Started in the Class Of program when it included a trip to California. The company did a great job of introducing everyone to tech sales. Pre-Covid, Class Of was a good way to make friends and score some freebies. 

The people are one of Oracle's best assets. It's easy to network and make friends since most people are willing to help and don't act too pretentious.

You get to choose from a number of locations across the country. However, salaries are fixed so your dollar will probably go farther in Austin than in Santa Monica.

Bonuses/Commission rates used to be better and promotions used to be plentiful. It was fairly common for a BDC to get promoted to a closing role after 1+ year in seat. Wasn't unheard of for recent college graduates to be making close to 6 figures.

Benefits are pretty solid, nothing to complain about here.

Sales training is top-notch. However, only recently did the company start caring about giving its salespeople a strong technical foundation.

Overall, a lot of Oracle's pros can be found at any other large tech company.
","Oracle is a behemoth of a company. You're just a number and any recognition you'll receive for doing a good job will be shortly met with a ""what have you done for me lately?"" mentality from your boss/director. 

Decision-making is a privilege reserved solely for upper management who rarely if ever step foot on the sales floor. For example, FY20 brought sweeping changes to OD Sales, with tons of people demoted without notice. I had 6 different managers my final year at the company. Sales here is a total revolving door.

Promotions are much harder to come by now as Covid led to several hiring freezes. The company would rather hire more Class Ofs for less money than promote internally or hire from the outside. Speaking of which, every account has upwards of 50 sales reps all calling into the same DBA, IT Manager, etc. so that by the time you reach out, you'll most likely be hung up on or sent straight to voicemail.

With promotions come minuscule 5% salary increases and unreasonable sales targets and commission rates.

BDCs, Inside Sales, and Field Sales, are often pitted against each other due to asinine territory management plans. Instead of working together to sell across product verticals, sales reps have to horde opporunity intelligence to ensure they can hit their quotas.

While Oracle does well in HW, On premise DB, and some SaaS, its PaaS & IaaS offerings are sorely lacking and the pressure to compete with the likes of AWS and Azure falls, unfortunately, on the sales reps.

While Oracle may be a well-known name to add to a resume, I'd highly suggest looking elsewhere. Or, at the very least, not spending too much time here.
Advice to Management
Stick to what you do well. Trying to compete with AWS and Azure places way too much stress on your salespeople.

Business Outlook
Pros
I have been a part of NetSuite’s Customer Success practice for the past 8 years. What I have consistently seen is considerable growth opportunities for those who perform and seek them out. NS has been growing consistently for my entire tenure, and that growth has accelerated since Oracle’s acquisition. Despite being part of Oracle, NS still operates as a separate GBU and has maintained it’s culture. NS is still small enough to be able to make a difference and stand out. There are significant advancement opportunities for those who perform. Don’t believe the myths about NS moving all of its onshore consulting roles to Manila and India. NS is growing both onshore and offshore aggressively and the two teams work as one global team.

If you’re ambitious and looking to grow your career while getting exposure to a world-class Cloud-based Customer Success operation, I would recommend joining NS. 

Note - NS delivers a large portion of manager comp through annual RSU grants and quarterly variable payouts, so be wary of the base salary data. Likewise, NS provides individual contributors with consistent quarterly discretionary variable payouts which makeup a large percent of total comp.
Cons
None - It has all the ingredients you need....it is what you make of it.

","There are a lot of cons, but the primary offense is the systemic misogyny and racism that constantly are identified and ignored. Women are paid far less and tasked with far more. Men are given promotions for doing much less. They refuse to actually do a salary comparison because they know the results will be bad and could implicate them in various lawsuits that are ongoing. A few final notes: bad actors are not punished but rather promoted, pay increases almost never occur, management is tone deaf, and the reward for good work is a lot more work.
Advice to Management
Get most of management out, they refuse to see/change the systemic issues.

","No recognition for the extra tasks.
No time allocation for extra task ( you have to do within the same 8 hours what you used to do + a lot more free of extra payment).
Some lower tier managers have the audacity to demand over-time.
Most middle tier/ upper tier managers don't care about Customer satisfaction, the only goal is to close as many tickets as possible.
Low to no knowledge from most of Fusion Cloud Implementation Consultants - majority log tickets seeking solutions not usage/ testing responses on various issues encountered.
2/3 of all Support Engineers don't have prior understanding of business flows and refuse learning it.
2/3 of all Support Engineers wanna pass their job to those 1/3 that care for Customer or wanna learn stuff.

Business Outlook
Pros
If you work hard and show initiative (networking, positive attitude, etc.), there’s no reason why you won’t get promoted into a closing role. Benefits and compensation are decent too. I’ve never been micromanaged and have had positive experiences with all my managers.
Cons
Certainly, customer perception and (probably) the products themselves aren’t up to the competition’s standards. This isn’t really an issue for BDCs and their short-term success in the role, but it makes long-term trajectory (from a resume, career-building, and compensation perspective) a little more hazy than ideal.
Advice to Management
I think the BDCs are really well managed at Oracle — not sure any of the listed qualms are particularly actionable for them.

Pros
- Lucked out with an AMAZING manager and great team
- Current manager provided interesting work and targets were always attainable without much overtime
Cons
- The gentleman who onboarded me and my group was absolutely awful, not knowledgable and made a lot of the fellow graduates I onboarded with uncomfortable. We gave feedback to this once our onboarding process was completed and NO RESPONSE FROM HR. DISAPPOINTED!!!! 
-Your experience is 100% based on who your manager is and if they advocate for you and care about your growth OR if they just care about themselves. I literally saw colleagues under a different manager in a different team get thrown under the bus by their managers. Not cool. 
- Promotion structure so rigid and not easy to switch departments
Advice to Management
- Only be a manager if you actually care about people, not to fulfill your ego. 
- SCREEN who you hire to have as your onboarding team PROPERLY. This is the first contact new hires have with your company and your brand.

","They pile on more work without providing any compensation. And there’s constantly an excuse as to why there isn’t money in the budget to give their employees more money, but it’s okay to spend that money on an office building during a pandemic. Employees complain about this in employee surveys and it’s constantly ignored. 
The company says they provide training and certs but if you want to get certified in anything it comes out of your pocket.
Advice to Management
Pay your employees!! Morale is so low because of this and it has killed the great atmosphere that this place once had. And this started LONG before the pandemic.

Advice to Management
Oracle's Management chain includes too many people which needs to be reduced. Oracle's managers need to get rid of their insecurity and do less micromanagement. They should let their employees grow. Oracle hires from premium institute and feels their employees will be happy without quality work, too much of micromanagement, and low salary!!

 Flexibility is good. And if you work with on-site team then you will be getting lot of flexibility wrt timings
If not looking for hikes and need a healthy employment then this is the company
","No Hike if you are not topper of the batch
If you are in the management radar you will automatically become good at work and topper of the batch coz of exposure you get. Others can lead a silent employment

Advice to Management
“Treat people how you like to be treated”. If any employees approached his/her manager for any concern, listen, and solve the issue rather playing a game and creating issues within the colleagues. And don’t treat them bad/speak rude during the team meetings, appraisal discussion rude, nor act like one teen kid, but be matured enough to handle the situation. Promotions should be based on the appraisal rating & the work done by an individual not based on who is close to the manager, it always mismatches. The ratings are always 4 & 5, but no promotion.
Don’t give false promises that there will be no layoff, but actual layoff happened and that too with an excellent performers & not the poor performer.

Business Outlook
Pros
If you’re in the first few years of your career, you can learn a lot. If you’re more than 4-5 years into your career, there’d be no reason to work for NetSuite. The office cultures have good energy, but with Covid, things have of course changed and many of the folks who were based in offices have moved back to where they are from.
Cons
Micro-Management across the board. 
Compensation not market-competitive. 
Overly-political, where promotions are given out to people who’ve been there a long time, not on merit. 
NetSuite having great difficulty selling to upmarket and are focusing efforts on small (1-5M revenue) companies - will not learn enterprise, strategic selling. 
Reps and Managers, alike, succeed by being CRM aces rather than Sales aces. Very little true development- it’s all about how well you can manipulate your CRM.

The management is ruining the good name of Oracle with their crass ways, absence of empathy and ethics even for that matter. They have reduced the culture on the inside to that of companies like Byjus that's infamous for pushy sales. Unfortunately they are in a position to force wonderfully skilled people out of their roles that they work hard to secure and the company is losing great employees every quarter due to this behavior. I hope someone reports to the headquarters of the unethical ways in which business is being conducted in this specific team and the toxic culture that is happily concealed as long as the business keeps coming.

I hope someone reports to the headquarters of the unethical ways in which business is being conducted in this specific team and the toxic culture that is happily concealed as long as the business keeps coming.

Pros
They have an awesome BDC training program where you learn a lot about the selling process.
Cons
They are ridiculously slow at implementing new projects and initiatives, the organization is so big and slow that some teams would go months during a transition process without having any work to do, and they use the wrong metrics to measure success - Ex. Amount of phone calls made instead of the quality of the phone calls made.

It’s a huge company with great benefits and good pay for the job. Being a BDC at Oracle is great if you’re interested in a career in sales.

2021-02-25, Senior Account Manager,,Current Employee,Big Red Machine,"Stability - it takes a long time for any change or innovation to happen so if you're after a stable job that operates like clockwork then you can try your hand at Oracle.
","Everything is about process, not in the way of trying to make things more efficient but red tape for administrative justification. You will be exhausted by having 2 jobs, your actual day job and the job of navigating internal politics. 

Oracle is not a company that looks out for its employees. There is a lot of talk about it where the management team do hurrah sessions to pat each other on the back, but execution is weak.
Advice to Management
Remove the middle management layer and have people actually doing their jobs, not just for show.

2021-02-23, Account Executive,"Reading, England, England","Current Employee, more than 3 years","Very corporate, but great commission","- Career Development opportunities
- Lots of sales training is offered 
- You work with very well experienced colleagues who you can learn a lot from 
- The company is focusing more on Diversity & Inclusion as well as on Volunteering opportunities (though I haven't seen an increase in D&I colleagues yet?)
- The commission. Oracle has very fruitful commission schemes that I haven't seen at other Corporate companies. Hence, if you are very driven to close and want to make a lot of money, Oracle is definitely the place to be in Sales
- Good benefit scheme (private insurance, dental insurance, health and wealth schemes)
- Working from home
","- Not much space for creativity & corporate messaging is encouraged when reaching out to prospects
- Internal processes are a nightmare (although you can get support here when you know the right people) 
- Very corporate company. There is absolutely no focus on building team spirit, have fun/engaging activities across the Group. Everyone is just working for themselves and that's all
- No Culture and Values (internally speaking)
- Internal transfers: you do not get paid fairly when progressing internally vs. external candidates who come in
Advice to Management
1/ Give sales the space to develop relevant value propositions for customers instead of sending Oracle focused/corporate content 2/ Award internal promotion. So far employees who progress in Oracle, are disadvantaged financially speaking. External candidates get a much higher salary and a higher level than internal candidates. Internal progression can take very slow too, which is why people leave the company for a much better salary (at least 150% higher). 3/ Bring back the sales spirit. After covid, organise team building events, award high performers with not just recognition but also awards or a small gesture. 4/ Hire more D&I employees

","There is a culture of cheating on certification examinations; employees are tacitly encouraged to seek out test dumps before taking cert tests. Upper management only wants to see certification percentage increase, regardless of the actual skill of the employees. Certifications that are supposed to require 2 years of experience before completion are expected to be obtained in 6 months or less, and it still affects bonuses.
Very political atmosphere between organizations within the company, almost like competing against different companies.

2021-02-17, Account Executive,"Los Angeles, CA",Current Employee,Terrible culture,"-Great place to learn the ropes of Saas and/or tech sales.
-Some people make a lot of money
-Few people are laid off
","-Turnover is so high I only know of small HR companies like ADP with similar attrition 
-Terrible pay increases. Colleagues, and myself included, would be paid anywhere from $30k-$50k less than ""professional hires"" with no software sales experience doing the exact same job. Promotion from within is rare and comes with a fractional increase in pay. (Example: Going for a field role after being at the company for 5 years you would be offered $80k while outside hires would be offered $110k+).
-Account Executives are paid $7k more than Business Development 
-Oracle is big enough that it doesn't feel the need to pay it's sales force well and it's felt across the sales culture
Advice to Management
Lower attrition and increase culture by paying your sales force the market value of the enterprise software/technology industry and encourage internal promotions (with consistent amounts) rather than hiring externally (and offering more).

Business Outlook
Pros
Oracle is a very well structured company, with plenty of growing opportunities. You have a vast array of learning tools available to you, so that you can grow in your career as well as your knowledge. Because of its vast size you are able to switch departments seamlessly as well as expand your career options within the company itself without having to look elsewhere.
Cons
It's a big company with a small heart. As much as may be touted about caring about people, it's painfully obvious when you see how disconnected management is from the workforce. If you come to Oracle knowing that you are simply a number, it'll help you navigate the company much better and understand the many organisational changes that occur.
Advice to Management
I'd advise Senior Management to read Steven Hassan's book on Cults to avoid creating a cult-like atmosphere within Oracle, which has been on the rise. Many unspoken rules often linger within the company which lead many to be unhappy, but afraid to speak out.

","Lack of career prospects - depending on the business unit / industry, there is a huge difference between salaries and opportunities. If it is the HSGBU, prepare that you will be stuck in the same position for years without any progress.
Upper management is not necessarily competent, some of them have no clue what their directs are doing.
Advice to Management
People do not want to retire from the same position. Invest in their education and also provide REAL support and opportunities in case they want to stay and move up between departments. Upskilling people and then have them do the same job for the same money is not a real upskilling and is practically nothing... you should listen to your people what are their plans for the future and read those damn appraisals.

Difficult to get exposure on new technology stack in some legacy projects.
Some projects (although they are few) have very restricted access to the internet from desktop. And on other side some teams has entire access to internet along with social networking sites.
Good learning opportunities depends on your project and relations with seniors.

Some may view this as a negative, but the job is basically an additional year of college. You move to a big city and start working with a couple hundred kids just out of college and youre making good money. Lots of opportunities to network and eventually move on from the company. Ultimately, big company, good pay, good friends.
Cons
The work is mindless at times and can make you feel worthless. Due to covid opportunities to move up were slim

Interesting products. Oracle may have declined, but it still has a lot of inertia pushing it forward.
","Many internal apps used for work are old and kludgy, looking like they were written 20 years ago. Others have serious performance issues, which really slow down work. There are two many architects involved in the development of internal tools and procedures, resulting in complex and cumbersome obstacles to the development of the documentation. Big one: almost no raises! If you stay more than five years your compensation not only doesn't grow, you lose ground because of inflation. People quit for this reason.

Pros
Best in class equipment (Macbook's samsung monitors, etc...etc), free beverages and gym on campus and experience with the latest and future technologies.
Cons
- Extremely hit or miss management. I worked there for 11 months and had 3 managers. 
- Being a large organization, they reorg all the time, which causes roles and territories to get mixed around. 
- Too much information for entry level employees to master. (Other companies such as Salesforce or AWS don't start college grads in these roles for a reason).
Advice to Management
- Be honest about what a ""Cloud Engineer"" is. Sales Engineering is a great role, but calling it a Cloud (specialization) Engineer role does not sound like sales at all. 
- Don't set the salary the same for all the hubs when COL is much higher in D.C, Boston and Santa Monica then Austin.

Pros
They hire a ton of college graduates, a strategy shared by all smart companies in my opinion. As such, it means they're willing to teach and train, and the investment they make in employees is much appreciated. I learned a lot about technologies that had previously been foreign: database, middleware, infrastructure, on-premises, and cloud solutions. Plus, it also pays well for people who lack experience. Never found it to be a particularly demanding job, and I very very rarely took home work after leaving.
Cons
The other side of hiring young is that many managers are young and often unqualified. They don't seek out input from those who are managed, so if you get a poor manager it means you're likely stuck with them, and their word will hold more weight than yours. Being tied to sales means you're also tied to quotas and other unimportant metrics, many of which are typically outside of your control.

Advice to Management
Directors in this department are more concerned with keeping people who perform well where they are to keep their own behinds covered instead of rewarding them with growth and further incentive. On one team I know of, the supervisor (who came over from sales and knows nothing about the software or the anything beyond making things look good on paper) was promoted and probably given raises multiple times. Most of the people on the hardworking team beneath her have been stuck in the same spot since before she arrived despite having done more than enough to progress to better things. My advice to management is to acknowledge this position of what it is, a stepping stone job, and reward the people that are making you look good instead of keeping them in the same place simply so that they can continue to do so.

A majority of people stay in this role only for the chance at a large deal. Luck is your best bet, as hard work is unlikely to impact customer buying habits for certain product lines. Quotas are set evenly across every territory, and territories are not even.

Few people enjoy the job, and a very large portion of people actively dislike coming to work. The quality of your manager makes a significant impact, and unfortunately many of the managers are disliked by their Sales Reps.

Additionally, people are frequently moved around to different teams, demoted, laid off, or fired.

","your performance/commission also depends of skill of your manager and luck of your territory (if your have a bad Account Exec, your opportunities will never make it). you have to really fight to get any kind of raise. unless you absolutely LOVE technology and software sales, then the work sucks the life out of you. Also, it is incredible hard to move into a different department other than sales for this role.
Advice to Management
Maybe change up the commission structure for starting BDRs, and enable growth or training so BDRs can learn about other departments. Encourage more team bonding, and focus more on learning and development. But still have to say, I loved most everyone I worked with. Keep at your recruiting and keep at developing superstars.

2021-01-25,Anonymous,,"Former Employee, less than 1 year",Hit or Miss,"Overall, the direction the company is moving in is really positive. There's going to be more alignment between product and customer-facing teams and there is a lot of product innovation happening. It's really exciting to see. The healthcare cover is fantastic. It's really really difficult to get fired.
","This is where the hit or miss comes into play. Some managers are fantastic and you'd be really fortunate to be on their team and be mentored by them. Other managers are really toxic and just plain awful. The 401K match and stock purchase plan left a lot to be desired considering the profitability of the company. Stock purchase plan offered a 5% discount, which is something but it could be more generous. The org structure is all over the place; there's little consistency across accounts, making it really difficult to know who to turn to and where responsibilities lie.
Advice to Management
Perform 360 reviews on managers and directors. I was given plenty of feedback, but unless a manager or director asked me for feedback, I didn't have the opportunity to give it. Poor managers cherry pick those to give them year-end evals, so their awful management skills go unnoticed and unimproved. For those way up at the tippy-top, remove the red tape and barriers for people to move teams and roles within the org. We're told attrition is at an all-time high, but then we're hanging on forever to get a transfer; this is pushing us to just look elsewhere.

Repor","Perform 360 reviews on managers and directors. I was given plenty of feedback, but unless a manager or director asked me for feedback, I didn't have the opportunity to give it. Poor managers cherry pick those to give them year-end evals, so their awful management skills go unnoticed and unimproved. For those way up at the tippy-top, remove the red tape and barriers for people to move teams and roles within the org. We're told attrition is at an all-time high, but then we're hanging on forever to get a transfer; this is pushing us to just look elsewhere.

2021-01-21, Business Development Representative,"Austin, TX","Current Employee, less than 1 year",Great Company. Great Product. Great People.,"For a first job out of college, you can’t ask for anything better. The first month is training and then you go live. There is a major need for NetSuite in the small-medium business sector so it makes outreach a lot easier. Everyone is fresh out of college so there’s a lot of energy and competition. Hands down one of the best sales development programs out there. The entire program is focused on lead generation and talent development. The BDR pay is top notch compared to other companies in the tech industry and the AE pay is significantly more once you get promoted. Like any sales job, it’s challenging at times but I would highly recommend Oracle NetSuite to any students applying for sales jobs in the tech industry.
","At times, the training sessions are unproductive and a waste of time.
Advice to Management
Keep promoting within the BDR program. There’s a lot of talented people that are hungry to be AE’s.

","Former company was bought out and instantly became part of Oracle without much forethought on either end. Oracle is excellent at selling product, but lacks with support. As a result, our team dealt mainly with unhappy customers who no longer had the same essential support from prior company to run their businesses 24/7. While the support infrastructure went south, the support fees climbed, which further upset customers which was understandable and sympathized with them, but not much we were able to do as everything came from corp, which should have been left with our specific team handling that vertical.

This review is only for Oracle Consulting, Singapore.

Pros:
* Get to work on some of the largest and more complicated engagements.
* Regional exposure across ASEAN.
* Hands off management style giving significant freedom
* Excellent peers - mostly senior, subject matter experts in their domains.
Cons
* Consultants required to don multiple hats, which gives great learning and exposure but can take a toll on work life balance.
* Limited career planning - you need to take charge of your career, network and find avenues to grow. This can be challenging for some.

2021-01-19, Senior Technical Writer,"Seattle, WA","Current Employee, more than 3 years","Good benefits, problematic management","Great benefits; overall culture in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure org of Oracle is community-focused (which encourages team communications and transparency); relatively easy to transfer between teams as desired; options to work remotely, post-COVID; many projects available to work on, so your career can be a bit self-directed by team; a good measure of autonomy.
","Persistent issues with top-down communication and direction; no practical support or training for managers, so many poor ones here; whistleblowers tend to be punished; review and promotion system is very broken (and was skipped entirely in 2020), leading to a lot of resentment and frustration; focus on hiring devs from competitors over hiring quality candidates where needed in the business is also causing resentment and frustration; suffers from the same sexism issues as most of tech (women rarely promoted into leadership, women paid less than their male counterparts); high-level execs seems disconnected from reality and their employees (one recently announced that ""cost of living has gone down this year"" as justification for no one below a specific managerial level getting COLAs).
Advice to Management
Invest in your current employees through managerial training and support, actively doing something with the mentorship program you created, being vocal about career development from a higher level of leadership, and showing an understanding of where employment gaps need to be filled on teams.

2021-01-18, Applications Sales Executive,"Burlington, MA","Former Employee, more than 3 years",Depression Mill,"Oracle has world-class training programs for their salespeople, especially those who join fresh out of college.
","Overworked and underpaid, the Oracle sales floors, once buzzing, are now barren wastelands. Management actively tells you NOT to learn about the product as a salesperson, so you don'tr realize how behind the competition our technologies are. Salespeople are forced to act on a detached management's half-baked ideas, both for sales plays and sales teams, effectively forcing the good talent out when they realize how backwards (or absent) the strategy is. In App sales, we were told to preach collaboration between departments, and how THAT is the key to successful business execution... 3 years later as a salesman, I still couldn't name anyone in Oracle's Marketing department. Bottom line, as an Oracle sales representative, you're forced to lie to the customer, produce results with a failing strategy, and give up any peace of mind/free time when your manager doesn't like your weekly results and makes you stay until 7:30 on a Friday to prove you want your job (without overtime of course!). Management at Oracle likes to push everyone until they're a burnt out, depressed, soggy little shell of the employee they originally hired. To all the college students looking at Class Of, do it, but dont stay more than 1 quarter after you get promoted. The abuse you take in 1 year here is more than anything you'll ever have to deal with at a healthy working environment.
Advice to Management
Pay increases to at least match inflation. Think through your ideas before turning them into teams, and rethink the company management style of ""Just put more pressure on them"". Thats how you get suicides, not productive employees.

Instead of buying new company to own product/customer, spend on employees to create a new product to get customer. 
And when you buy new talent from NITs and IITs, with 5 rounds of very tough interviews, trust me put them in good role instead of putting in manual testing and ruining there life.

It's generally a very relaxed environment so it's very easy to get into a daily rhythm. You get a number of holidays that many companies don't have off. You can get certified in Oracle products for free and they have tuition reimbursement.
","1. The pay is low for the work expected.
2. You don't have much ability to implement change to the products or practices. 
3. There isn't much room to move within the company.
4. Raises are few and far between. New employees straight out of college will come in making more than engineers with years of experience. 
5. The turnover is high.
Advice to Management
You need to push more money to the lower rungs of the company. Oracle doesn't have the ""hot young cool"" reputation like Google, Facebook, or Salesforce so it's hard to pull in young talent. But when you do, it's hard to keep young talent when they aren't paid what they're worth. High turnover also leads to higher stress since there's fewer people with many years of experience.

2021-01-13, Principal Member of Technical Staff,Bangalore,"Former Employee, more than 8 years",Horrible company with bunch of incompetent leaders,"I haven't seen any pros, cons are as follows
","Well here the list goes on

Oracle in general,
1. Not an employee friendly company
2. No open door policy
3. ""Transparency"" does not exist in their dictionary

Things that I have observed
1. Alarmingly outdated technology
2. Those who are staying here for long time are known for their arrogance as well as stupidity
3. Managers are high paying idiots, they have no clue what's going on in the project, what are the challenges, whether the code is of good quality. They are just bothered about number of code changes getting merged so that they can use it as a trump card of their promotion

4. Managers (onwards) are there just to warm their seats and to shout at their subordinates for no reason, now a days trends are changing, managers are becoming engineering managers. But Oracle managers are happy to remain as good for nothing leeches.

5. No hike or bonus for atleast 2-3 years no matter how much you put.
6. In the end, there is no learning only meaningless slogging
Advice to Management
1. Upskill yourself and help your employees, don't just sit like leeches and eat all money.
2. Its quite evident, you are incompetent, leave your job and sell vegetables, the salary you are drawing can be used to feed 4-5 talented folks.
3. Don't just think about your benefits, sometimes think about the product also.
4. Do some courses on ""how to become a good manager"", because you guys are clearly good for nothing, incompetent, dumb parasites who are sitting in the company for years and destroying the talent pool

Pros
Amazing place to start your career. Beautiful building and an opportunity to live in LA and work near the beach. Your peers are a ton of people your age so the culture is great. You learn a ton of great tech industry and business knowledge and skills but at the end of the day, it's a sales gig. Day after day of cold calls, emails, linkedin messages. Quarter after quarter of demanding quotas, stressful micromanagement tendencies and repetitive trainings.

Overall, it's a great place to get experience in the industry, especially if you want to go into sales. For the 80% of BDCs who don't want to be in sales and never wanted to be in the first place, it's a good name-recognizable place holder on your resume for your next job.
Cons
Work satisfaction often depends heavily on who your manager is (micromanagey, etc)
Lots of pointless activities such as repetitive trainings.
Constant changes. 
Sales jobs.
Advice to Management
Don't be micromanagey. 
If you want to lower turnover, be more open to BDCs switching departments.

Pros
Most co-workers are very friendly
Lots of new hires who try to make a positive difference
Cons
North America Applications leadership doesn't care about talent development, career progression, rewards & recognition and morale within the consulting organization that reports up to NAA.
A serious lack of talent prohibits efficient & effective project management of the consulting engagements to implement the cloud applications
Consulting projects are underestimated, under priced and under staffed with weak project governance. Most projects are in red status. Consultants work tirelessly to make up for the deficiencies and to cover scope creep to keep customers happy.
Application licensing teams whip the consulting organization around by giving short notice on pursuit deadlines, slash estimates, margin & contingency and overpromise on scope & service levels. 
Those same projects are highly marketed within Oracle as success stories.
Promotions from Analyst to Sr. Analyst have been rare (though getting better). Promotions above Sr. Analyst are extremely rare. Salary increases are extremely rare.

Pros
- big company so it looks good on your resume
Cons
- terrible culture 
- deceptive leadership 
-abysmal top-down leadership
- 0 perks 
- gave all US consultants raises during COVID both nothing to Canadians
- it took 8 days for the founder to send out an company-wide internal email about BLM (said he is thinking of strategic ways to address the matter and make the company more inclusive only to put an Instagram post up a week or so after the email and call it a day) but only took 12 hours to send out an internal email about DC riots (condemning it)
- never once saw leadership in the office... but they call in every from their ranches and barn in the country
- contradictory leadership
- zero funds to provide WFH tools (desks, monitors, etc)
Advice to Management

Business Outlook
Pros
Falling under the umbrella of Oracle, the organization gives you MNC perks. The Oracle access card can be used at any of the regional offices.
Facilities at Oracle Tech Hub can be availed.
The office interiors and general perks are as good as other MNCs and there are 11 total holidays available in a year.
Cons
They make dry promotions. Bonus is variable, and subject to the business of the region you're working for. Even when your performance remains same, if you shift regions that you're working for, your bonus may be affected.
They majorly use legacy PL/SQL technology to handle Flexcube related things. As a consultant, there isn't much progress in the first two years with the organizations. The tools they use are also pretty outdated.

","Though I was in a ""start-up"" portion of the company, there was a tremendous amount of mismanagement across the board. From team leaders to higher up, the levels of actual work being completed was minimal with books being cooked and favoritism all across the board. Which is probably why that section was disbanded, but the new direction wasn't any better. No sooner had we crossed into the new fiscal year, than layoffs became necessary. Why it was necessary was above my pay-grade... All I know is they gave little direction or metrics for success towards the end. You can't improve if you don't know the goal.
Advice to Management
Be more transparent. Create success metrics for all departments and teams. Let them prove their worth before summarily dismissing them. Or give them ample time to re-situate themselves in the company instead of the standard two weeks. It can be a great company to work for if the management hires leaders who think more about their product and employees rather than their own bonuses.

Coworkers were very smart and professional.
","I worked at Oracle for over 5 years and never saw a pay raise. 
Technical Support Management only cared about their metrics. My first manager was good and seemed to care about his team somewhat. My second manager could hardly remember the names of his team members and constantly pointed out mistakes and flaws, very rarely praising a job well done.
Formal training was nonexistent. Employees were required to read manuals and documents on their own for their training.
We were significantly under staffed and over worked, yet they still laid off one third of our team (twice).
Senior management would consistently preach about good customer service, then they would take away all of the tools to provide said service.
Stressful environment. I don't miss it for minute!

Business Outlook
Pros
Stable job
Proper 9-5 job
Hire really smart people
Very good starting job with a huge branding.
BDC is the first step into doing sales, but can't be stuck in this role for too long.
Take the opportunity to learn about Oracle portfolio. Like it or not, they are one of the biggest corporation and there's a reason why.
A lot of learning platform internally with a lot of helpful teammates.
Huge investment towards the cloud, cutting edge technologies
Great valuable certification from Oracle which is great for any future employment
Cons
Coming from the BDC perspective, the BDC title is actually telemarketing. So don't be too excited thinking you are doing any ""business development"". Your job is just to pick up phone and call. Not much of a rocket science there. They hire graduates in pretense of learning sales, but you are basically cheap labor to pick up call, as career progression is really difficult here. 

From telemarketing, you basically move to another telemarketing role + sales closure. The BDC is constantly at risk of losing their value since there's not much ROI coming from this business unit, since their job is just demand gen. 

Also there are lots of office politics going on, since everyone needs to keep their job. While doing your job, you need to be able to manage politics as well.
Advice to Management
Be honest to applicants that BDC means telemarketing. Do not have to sugar coat it to sound more fancy than it really is. This will help you filter those who are really meant for the job instead of the constant turnover.

Advice to Management
For a business where the main product is dependent on people services, it needs to be more in tune not just to the business it is in but also the people. You can easily find people managers with neither people skills nor coaching skills and feedback over the years has done nothing to improve the situation, which clearly shows something.

","Oracle gives a pay rise to 5% of it's employees every 2 to 3 years. So you can go 10 years and not get a pay rise. There are Engineers that exceed expectations in their performance ratings and yet do not receive a pay increase. Oracle believes you should take pride in working for Oracle rather than the money which is so sad. If you get the chance to join, negotiate a very high salary because you will not get another pay rise if you are luck enough in at least 2 to 3 years.

HR was the most active I have seen in many multinational companies (IBM, Microsoft, Dell), with a lot of actions and programs for employees well being.
","Oracle was slowly losing its leadership in Enterprise Business to Cloud companies such as AWS and Microsoft. High executives didn't accept that, and though that every deal lost because Oracle absolutely had no product in the Cloud to compete was a salesperson or technical specialist failure.

- incredible WLB
- above average pay
- legacy groups (DB, MySQL, Java) still have some of the brightest minds in the entire industry
- extremely large scale offers unique opportunities
- remote work
- company paid conferences, training, travel
- D&I is taken seriously
","- Bureaucracy. Yes, every big company has it, and yes, it's worse at Oracle.
- volatility in the cloud org has impeded aspects of critical feature development, and it remains totally uncompetitive
- security are hamstrung by top-down corporate policies that make no sense
- ""eat your own dogfood"" applies here but Oracle internal products are awful
- no raises. dry promotions, dive & save offers come too late to retain talent
Advice to Management
You need to stop bleeding engineers by properly compensating your US employees outside of OCI, and adopt corporate legal and security policies compatible with a culture of innovation. I have witnessed your posture of legal/security risk aversion cost us multiple 8-figure deals due to the tremendous strain it puts on our ability to act on partnerships in a timely manner, and the chronic failure to innovate induced by this culture poses an existential threat to our business. Retain and empower your ICs.

Recommend
CEO Approval
Business Outlook
Pros
1. Such an incredible place to learn - NetSuite puts a ton of pressure on their entry level analysts to learn and learn fast, I think that if you want a challenge this job will give it to you. You'll be really stressed your first year trying to learn everything and to be a good consultant but the amount you learn in your first year is insurmountable compared to other jobs

2. Very little micro-managing - if you like to take on leadership and do your things yourself NetSuite doesn't micro manage - in fact your manager will probably never even know a fraction of the things you're doing most of the day. Definitely a pro if you don't like to be micro-managed a con if you want to have a relationship with your manager

3. Heavy exposure to many lines of business - depending on what you specialize in, NetSuite provides you great exposure to many different types and kinds of businesses through their ""shared resource pool""
Cons
1. Isolating - very little connection between managers/co-workers/project managers. You feel really distant from management and your ""manager"" doesn't even really know what you're up to unless you're in trouble. Oracle doesn't do anything to help foster a connection between leadership and their employees.

2. Very little work-life balance - expect to work weekends, late nights, and not get paid overtime until after your first year. Your PTO and vacation days are counted against your utilization so basically they inevitably discourage you from using PTO as your utilization is the key metric they look at for promotions. Expect to give your life and soul to NetSuite for your first 2 years if you end up staying that long

3. Over-Utilized and Underpaid - compared to other firms oracle overworks their tenured consultants while consistently underpaying them. You won't get a bonus, you won't get a pay raise until they promote you - it's really corporate and you can't do anything about it (no negotiations, ""it's just how it is"")

4. Retention - so many people leave and management doesn't do anything to acknowledge the lack of retention
Advice to Management

Career progression can be hindered, new joiners tend to be paid more than legacy employees because of Oracle's limited payrise policies creating large remuneration gaps.

","No focal, no RSU, no bonus, no promotion, no work hour flexibilities and no performance reviews. Management lack of technical and management skills to lead teams. They seem to be waiting for their retirement. Internal job rotation punishes employees with no career and monetary growth. Managements also set higher expectation on employees who work there for more than 4 years while offering new hires who have less related working experience same title and higher salaries (Yes, because no salary adjustment ever since). They are only interest in retaining new hires as they think people who work there for over 4 years are pretty much stuck with the team/company. The only way to grow at Oracle is to getting offers from other companies so that they know you are not stuck with them
Advice to Management
Value those who have been contributing at the company for more than 4 years and are willing to actively take challenges and learn new things by volunteering themselves in job rotations within the team/department in the company. They shouldn't be punished with no growth.

Promote those who have technical skills to managers so that they can at least lead the teams with their experiences and decision-making mindset instead of doing nothing on both technical issues and people management and waiting for retirement.

Gender pay is WAY off. My VP accidentally sent out everyone's salary and the women make $37K less then the men - and, we all do the same job. Fix this across the board and stop defending having a mostly white, male culture. Diversity does not exist and the CEO thinks diversity means whiny women. Don't move people into roles they can't do. This is a major leadership flaw. Stop competing internally - on prem vs. cloud selling into the same account is stupid. Customers disengage with this and marketing needed an overhaul, but no real progress has been seen to date. OCI is the only technology that works, so no wonder there is growth. And, to grow in your career, you have to STAY a long time, wear khakis and have white hair.

Pros
Decent benefits, matching for lots of charities, NS ERP is great.
Cons
Constant churn in mgmt, no raises/comp changes regardless of performance, 4 mgrs in 2.5 yrs, only way to get a raise is to leave and come back 12 months later, heard this from multiple people. Seems like there is very much a clique of who's in - they get the spoils. Feels like factory job and just as mind numbing, cannot find a new job fast enough. Everything w/ Oracle is self service so if you have computer issues, good luck. 'Unlimited PTO' is a joke, holidays count against you so anytime not billing is a dinge on your billability. The only reason for 'unlimited PTO' is so they don't have to pay out when you leave. Not allowed to schedule PTO more than 3 months in advance.
Advice to Management
There is no incentive to stay, zero comp changes in 3 yrs. No career opportunity with constant churn in mgmt. My efforts make zero difference in my comp, mgmt only cares about CSAT, no reason to 'go the extra mile'. Unlimited PTO - really? Sounds great, if it were really only true.

Business Outlook
Pros
If you find yourself in the ""Right"" organization within the company, there are many benefits. If you don't, your experience may be vastly different. In some organizations:
- More stable parts of the organization provide a feeling of job security - its common for people to leave and come back a few months/years later
- Lots of opportunity for working across teams and getting exposure to different areas
- Unlimited vacation (not applicable to all orgs and not all countries)
Cons
- It seems that the company is constantly reorganizing, so if you find yourself in a less stable part of the organization, expect to have a new role and new management chain at least every year, if not even more often.
- If you are fortunate enough to be in a more stable part of the company, there is much more security but little room for upward growth and development
- The typical red tape exists, as expected at any mega company of this size

","Old style of management. Too numbers focused. No customer focus. Sell at all cost, even if client does not use solution. Scare and intimidate customers with audits if they don't sign deals.
Advice to Management
Oracle needs to a new management ethic. The only thing that matters here is the number. Focus on people, employees, customers and partners. Stop selling shelfware. Solve customer problems and focus on value for the customer. Stop threatening employees (performance management) and customers (audits) if you want to partner with and get the best out of them. Almost replace all of the middle management layer, they don't challenge global or regional decisions, even when they don't work.

This is probably the worst global company I've ever worked for.

Raises are rare to come by. It was explained to me by upper management that it is easier to access the budget for new hires than the budget for raises. Lots of people deserve promotions but my experience showed that the company rather invest in outside talent then retaining current employees. I was told that best way to get a raise is to leave and come back. Company also publicly promotes moving within organization but management made it clear that they did not support that.

2020-11-25, Senior Software Engineer,Brno,"Former Employee, more than 3 years",Solid option but can be stifling,"Stable. Decent benefits. Good salaries. Company culture is okay, rather friendly. Would recommend as the first choice if you only care about money, otherwise as a backup option.
","Not OpenSource-friendly to say the least. A lot of bureaucracy. Many modern technologies can't be used. NIH syndrome. Vertical culture. The messages from the management feel like marketing and spam instead of sincere communication with colleagues. It didn't feel like the management had a high level of trust and respect to the employees, compared to some other companies. In general it wasn't too bad, just demotivating, inefficient and sometimes annoying.
Advice to Management
Let your engineers use free software with less bureaucracy. Allow them to contribute to the FOSS community. Don't fight the community, join it and earn respect. Currently ""I worked for Oracle"" is not a phrase to say proudly in many circumstances.

Primarily all-white management of the same breed, they speak negatively about their utility clients internally, yet assume their clients should stay loyal to them. Clients are dropping like flies primarily due to Management.

Little or no upward mobility unless you are a legacy Opower person. Management promotes themselves every year, but does not promote their own people. Management is also racist and only promotes white employees.

They don't appreciate the stability and breadth that Oracle provides them. Legacy Opower management believe that Oracle is holding them back. Reality check - it's incompetent and stuck up management who are the source of all issues.

2020-11-19, Software Engineer,Bangalore,Current Employee,No Covid support or pay raises,"- Take my sweet time to give delivery. No one forces to give work on time.
- Used to have work from Home policy, but now every other company has this. So there is no difference now.
","- Oracle does not have any broadband policy for India. So you cannot claim broadband bills.
- No Covid support for getting infrastructure for work from home. Insurance premium is high for additional covid support.
- No pay raise if you have joined above the median in payband. India pay band is very pathetic and lowest among other product companies.
- Not too many team fun activities
- Sodexho food coupons cannot be used outside of Oracle campus. Not even in neighbourhood restuarants or even on swiggy.

- It is both a pro and con: great friends/peers but a few ego-maniacs too.
- Managers are usually technical, which is great.
- In many teams you can achieve good work-life balance.
- Continuous education funding (they sponsored my Msc!)
- Great stability in your job (is normal to count your time in decades here).
- A lot of diversity in the business units, if you want a change usually you can find it within the company; which is a self-contained universe.
","- Outside of DB org, things vary more and can be less stable.
- Some areas use legacy processes and technology.
- Some areas compete to each other rather than collaborating (same with some peers).
- Depending on the area, you may get stuck with old technology or niche knowledge for many years.
- In some projects, you may have too many meetings with big audiences; which is usually not very productive.

","Annual leave is at 20 days only, you need to purchase the rest. 
Management is poor at recognising talent if you are not in a sales role.

2020-11-16, Cloud Sales Representative,Málaga,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",Toxic culture VS great salary - what will it be?,"Benefits & compensation
For juniors it's a great place to jump start your career
You will learn a lot.. Especially with regards to stress-resistance, restraint, and tolerance.
Not too male dominated
","Extremely high fluctuations: Typical American hire & fire policies, even in Spain - never assume that just because you're hired within the fiscal year they'll keep you for the next FY.

Toxic work environment: prepare for people you've never dealt with trying to ""steal"" your compensation on a deal you closed single-handedly.
The company fosters competition between colleagues in a way that is absolutely counterproductive. The worst part is that your clients know that already so forget about building a trusting relationship with them, they know you'll be gone by tomorrow. Never seen that before, but it's common business at this company. That place is full of selfish sharks who will try to manipulate your leads so you don't get to close your deal on your own territory & customer base.

Some of you might say that this is standard in the life of a sales person. It shouldn't be necessary to spend 80% of your time fighting inside of your company and not being able to focus on your clients.

Pros
-Solid work-life balance, very rarely have to work past 5 or 6pm if you are able to manage your tasks
-They throw you on tons of client-facing projects where you are the lead consultant, so it is ultimately a good learning experience
-In depth training program (4 months long)
-Able to work 100% remotely if that is your thing
Cons
-With client facing work comes a lot of draining, unhappy employees, having to juggle lots of these employees at once with limited support from the org can feel isolating 
-Dated physical office 
-Lack of communication with org changes, had lots of people have their job titles and functions changed with very little explanation 
-Upper management disconnected from employees
-Main metric is utilization rates for promotion criteria, do not receive feedback often enough

2020-11-09,Anonymous,Bucharest,"Current Employee, more than 5 years",Life in Oracle,"- if you have a good manager then you are a lucky one, as in any company.
- Some bonuses for job well done (not monthly)
- meal tickets
- Health insurance
- Oracle employees discounts for some stores/ fitness
- Free platforms to be able to learn
","- salaries do not get raised very often and if they do very little (10% maximum in 2 years). some never did.
- The vacation days are not paid out only if you leave, in rest you are obligated to take them otherwise they get deleted.
- year end/ Christmas bonuses are applicable only for the countries which are obligated by law, in Romania they do not apply.
- the bonuses for job well done , are taxable so from the amount provided actually you receive less even though you have spent more as you need to provide receipts. 
- you do not have any other allowances other than the salary itself, only if you are upper management or you work with with other regions due to late working hours.
- you mainly do overtime to be able to get your tasks done, but if you submit overtime it is not very appreciated (""you are not well organized"")even if you do the tasks in some cases for 2-3 people.
- Management prefers to hire people which are ""Yes Mam"" 
- Some Managers are known for Micro managing . 
- some employees are afraid to speak up due to managers action afterwards. even if it is a problem raised by the employees to the HR regarding a manager nobody acts upon the complains (even in exit forms).
- Nobody asks why people leave so frequently (less than 2 years) - also, nobody cares.
- Some Managers get promoted on the work of their directs or take responsibility as their own accomplishment even if they did not get implicated at all, sometimes even made it harder on their directs to manage that project (as not worthy)...while the directs..you guessed it, get nothing.
- in-house trainings made by people which have no people skills, or are true trainers.
Advice to Management
- understand your directs and appreciate them more
- increase of salaries to the people which they truly want to evolve in the company giving them a raise of 10% in 4 years (while their KPIs are always 4)....it's nothing

","Overly political. Not a good place for women or minorities. Poor employee AND customer care. Pays less than other Bay Area employees.
Advice to Management
There are some talented people working here. Unfortunately, politics is the main driver, not quality of work or customers. For this reason, there is high employee turnover (still happening despite the global pandemic) and high customer dissatisfaction . If you work here, use it as a stepping stone to other jobs and don't think of it as a place to stay long. The top executive's political contributions to advance his own agenda are at odds with Oracle's corporate message of diversity & inclusion.

","So many. Career dead end, corporate politics. Corporate culture stifles initiative, innovation, creativity and inventiveness. Cost of living raises don't really keep up with the cost of living. The odds are that you will be doing the exact same job you was hired for in 5 years without a material meaningful raise. So many layers of middle management all desperate to take credit for any successes big or small, there has to be a seismic event to shake loose tiny crumbs of recognition for the doers.

Business Outlook
Pros
There are lots of opportunity to learn and if you’re motivated enough, and depending on the type of projects you work on, the teams can be great to work with. It’s a nice enough out of college job and with the free certifications, it’s easy to jump over to a partner firm (with much higher pay).
Cons
First off, the middle management seems either incapable or unwilling to actually act towards any change. So what you say to your manager likely won’t go anywhere. The staffing model also needs improvement; the current system leaves several consultants grossly overworked and others without any work. In the past year the culture has almost completely disappeared (even pre covid) in favor of a high turnover rate. They hire almost exclusively college grads for the consultant role and as a result there’s a huge knowledge gap between older and newer consultants, where older consultants don’t have time to train new ones. You’re also encouraged to value utilization over quality. They say it’s a strong 9-5 culture unless you’re in the group of overworked consultants- then it’s however long it takes to get the job done.
Advice to Management
With the current promotion system, there’s little to no incentive to continue high utilization with work. Transparency would also go a long way in improving the culture. With how secretive things are internally, it leads to a lot of speculation and rumors. Also, spend more time taking care of the current consultants vs hiring new ones who are untrained.

","The management is very under trained and incapable of helping you. They are all clearly there to just collect a paycheck. The CRM is very unorganized and makes your life very difficult. The whole culture of the BDR organization makes you feel like you are being judged on many levels. I felt very uncomfortable being in the office as it wasn't very inclusive and you are treated as just another number. Hard to develop professionally when the management isn't very professional. Your vertical is randomly given to you and this could result in you either being fired or hitting your quota. Some of the industries you will work in are clearly not well thought out and result in everyone majorly struggling and getting ridiculed/called out in front of others. Networking is also strongly discouraged. Not much work life balance either. You will be glued to your laptop for 10 hours a day to be successful.
Advice to Management
Create a collaborative culture rather than pin BDRs against one another. Build the BDRs up rather than making them feel like they are failing. Hire managers who have management experience rather than just sales experience because that doesn't always carry over. Don't act like everything is great and going well when there are clearly some substantial issues.

- Good pay: Great for a first corporate gig.
- Good paid training: Lots of resources to learn everything from Java, Cloud Infrastructure to Sales and Solution Engineering.
","- No Work-Life-Balance (WLB): Depending on your Global Business Unit (GBU). There could be no work life balance and you may not be compensated properly for all the extra hours you work.
- No easy advancement or promotion. Perhaps this is an issue the tech industry as a whole is privy to but you'll have to jump ship to get promoted.
Advice to Management
Promote from within, fully incorporate Global Business Units (GBUs) like NetSuite and other acquisitions.

2020-10-26, Applications Sales Representative,"Burlington, MA","Current Employee, more than 1 year",Room for process improvements,"It's a solid SAAS / IAAS / Tech sales foundation. This is 101 and 201 out of the BDR program and you will learn if you are a right fir for Oracle or if you will find success at most other companies. The Oracle sales model is an esoteric bundling of overlapping teams where it becomes easy to lose sight of the customer unless you're highly collaborative and willing to sell your own interests internally before ever becoming part of true customer relationships. It is difficult to maintain coherence of Oracle's brand ownership but if all the overlapping teams are able to coordinate effectively, they become a deal-making machine. It is all a numbers game, internally and externally. If this type of sales does not suit you, then you can walk onto most other sales roles because of the excellent training and development resources that resemble more of an academy than onboarding.
","Either Oracle's way of doing business works for you, or it does not. If you want autonomous control of being the brand representative for your accounts as you are trained to be, then you will find that in a direct sales role at most other cloud services company.
Advice to Management
Find a way to build out the structure of alignment more clearly. The traditional vertical / horizontal corporate planning structure is executed to a T and runs well on Oracle's own architecture, but sales does not execute in tune to this architecture. Some sort of ""Diagonal"" or simplified expression of alignment information needs to be built into collaboration tools, this could be done easily on Slack.

","The culture has declined over time but always been problematic. Oracle is not the type of place that rewards identifying risks and problems. There is a huge emphasis on following the party line and never questioning decisions or paths forward. Top performers are labeled as a troublemaker when they try and warn the organization of customer problems or potential issues with product or approach. And eventually they get let go. It's become like a mafia since new management came from AWS, Microsoft, and Salesforce. 

You either drink the coolaid and shut up, or you can spend your entire career here watching the ""yes man"" types get ahead.
Advice to Management
RETIRE. If you have been around for 20+ years, it is about time for you to retire. Life is happening outside of Oracle and companies are indeed offering cutting edge technologies which you are clueless about. Stop pretending you are on top of your game and enough talking about the Gartner report for God's sake. It is a 100 years old- just like you.

Very cheap - always cutting costs even during great sales years. Very hard to earn promotions or even raises once hired. Expect no more than 3-5% as a top performer, many go years without any adjustments while executives and upper management reap the rewards. You are truly just a number and the company overall doesn't care much for rewarding its employees for good work beyond useless pats on the back.

2020-10-11, Senior Human Resources Business Partner,"Rocklin, CA",Current Employee,A great Place to get your career going,"Oracle is a large, but relatively stable company, with a growing line of Cloud computing offerings. Oracle strives to be on the cutting edge of Cloud technology and all sorts of other related software, which is one the reasons that Oracle is an admired tech company.
","Oracle is a notoriously cheap when it comes to paying their employees. It's not uncommon for employees to years without a pay raise, bonus, promo, stock/RSUs, etc. For most functions, Oracle pays far LOWER than the market. Advice: negotiate the highest compensation package possible, as you may not see another increase in pay for awhile.
Advice to Management
Wake up!! Many good employees are leaving Oracle (yes, even in this job market) to go to other tech companies who pay them what they are worth. If you don't stop the practice of not paying hard working/dedicated employees what they should be paid, more will leave and more will go to competitors who pay better, e.g. Amazon AWZ, Google, Salesforce.com, etc. You can't be #1 in the industry with #3 and lower employees. You get what you pay for. Pay your employees fairly!!

Advice to Management
From my experience, management needs to take the time to recognize and value their employees, especially those that are high performing. The lack of organization and transparency make it difficult to outline a timeline for your career path, and many people are becoming frustrated by the ""unknowns."" Do a better job asking for employee feedback and presenting them with options.

","1. Our department was completely dismissed this year :(
2. Unfortunately I met a poor manager with ""special"" style you may never hear : in team one will be chosen to take on double or triple workload than others then there may(yes, may not can) be a small raise every year. Otherwise there will be no raise for several years ！！ For example, considering 3 employees in a team and 10 tasks, usually the assignment would be 3-3-4 but for this manager the assignment would be 2-2-6 or even 1-1-8. I swear I am not kidding at all !! The ""chosen"" one will stay the same till he left. Nobody knows the reason and manager insisted this was right in his opinion. I saw one guy worked very hard every day that he even had no time for lunch while his peers are pretty free, then in Nov he was told that there was no budget of salary raise. There is no way to object except leave . 
3. The chair is very bad, because of back-ache many employees bought replacement on their own but company prohibit that.

Review are annual cost of living raises happen never. I went 6 year with great reviews from peers and customers without a single raise. So that is year over year pay cuts.

They clawed back ever benefit, they even demanded you work from home and took back your internet expense....

Money for raises are distributed to you manager, who then can allocate that amount to anybody, with or without merit. So sucking up to the boss is the only way to go. 

The hate their staff a bit more than they hate their customers.

Besides offering no career path they practice ageism, after 20 years of service at 59 years of age I was laid off by HR , with no notice to my manager or the 2 managers above him.

Working with people who's morals are in disagreement with your own is soul sucking. I'm sorry I stayed so long.

","Not much engagement between different functions, most people do not know or want to know about processes in other functions.

Oracle does not value existing employees, salary reviews happen very seldom. However, Oracle will not hesitate to pay a new recruit a lot more above what existing employees of many years make in the same role. So negotiate your package very well if you have a job offer because chances are you will not see any more money for the rest of your employment there.

","Oracle impose a very aggressive and singular focus on driving revenue, to the detriment of customer relationships and CSAT. This approach is more aggressive in regions such as GULF, APAC, MEA.

2020-09-24, User Experience Designer,Barcelona,"Current Employee, more than 5 years",not customer and employee centric company,"Big organisation with big budgets, can sponsor whatever makes employees ""happy"" such as fancy events, kitchen equipment, games, teambuildings.

As a designer, you have plenty of space to experiment. The UIs are really bad, it is easy to make them better. Good for juniours who need to screw up few things first.

You will get a top end equipment such as latest model of macbook, all perriferies you need.
","Culture is terrible. Typical corporate culture even though they try to look like cool team. It is not truth. Problems are fixed with free lunch and then the leaders brag about it for weeks.

There is not enough designers, expect overload of work. 

More then designing you will be business modeling.

Designers are generally not considered on the same level as PMs or DEVs. You will need to build your own position. Not easy for juniors. There is a lot of pushbacks.

Research is not the standard. If you want it, you do it. Do not expect PMs to base their decisions on research. They use gut feeling or middle management advice they do not completely understand.

Middle management is not helpful, they ale a blocker from being fast and agile team. They block things from release because they want things to be 100% ready. They do not like to risk anything.

Value your employees. Stop firing and hiring cheaper replacements. Each person you lay off, may no longer be interested to be a customer of Oracle anymore in the future too.

2020-09-16, Vice President of Engineering,"Redwood City, CA","Former Employee, more than 5 years",Difficulties of pivoting from traditional enterprise on-premise software to cloud-based services,"Oracle is focused on enterprise business software pivoting to cloud based software services and has invested heavily in cloud for the last 5+ years. Although it is late to the cloud, it should not be discounted as we are still early in cloud based services
","1. Lack of earlier investments in cloud causes urgency in time-to-market of its cloud based services
2. Time-to-market causes short cuts to its engineering fundamentals
3. Top-down approach to engineering innovation - which kills true innovation
4. Pre-mature optimization - too focused on common engineering processes between newly developing / newly developed services, rather than enabling new services to be deployed
Advice to Management
1. Provide more contexts on company goals and translate that to priorities of each division, department, and group (and less micro-management)
2. Remind supporting organization of their duties are to enable the primary product teams how to achieve their goals (not to instead create roadblocks)

Opportunities for growth
","The culture is awful at NetSuite. Never have been at a company with such a lack of respect for employees. If you’re not performing they don’t care if you have something personal going on they will PIP you and you’ll be on your way out. Favoritism is very apparent, it is what it is. In terms of growth, the company is doing well. However, since there is such favoritism going on, opportunities are limited based on your connection with the leadership and not based on value you will bring or ability to do the job at hand. I’ve seen very qualified employees interview internally for promotions and not get the job because a manager has favorites. If you’re not a favorite, you won’t grow here.
Advice to Management
Starts from the top down, of top leaders don’t start making a culture change, there won’t be one. Care about your employees and their mental health a little more than the ARR you’re needing to close that month. We all have a responsibility to do our job, but you can also be a human being and care for your employees.

","Senior Management is fragmented and doesn't have a cohesive vision for the company. The vision they do have doesn't get translated well and the average employee has almost no idea how their contribution fits into the big picture. Consequently, there is constant fear regarding the VERY frequent lay off cycle. 1st, 2nd and 3rd line managers have absolutely no input on lay off, raises or bonuses - it's all decided at the Exec level (in a vacuum). The new executive leadership doesn't value expertise or track record -only the bottom line.

","Managers: they do all what they can to demotivate people and to scare them, on daily basis. They just think about money in the short term. Not because they are bad people, they are just unable to understand the market and the big picture. They are very manipulative indeed.
Integration: people tend to come from a specific circle of friends, they will get best accounts and all the OTE. Different ethnic origins are just left outside of the circle. People outside of the circle are used as scapegoat.
Very few female or LGBT since it is difficult for them to relate with the culture.
Meritocracy: you can't find any.
You are expected to be a male second hand cars seller with short term in mind.
If you are different you are going to suffer.
Structure: very complex unnecessarily processes. Internal competition.

","Nearly impossible to get a raise/promotion unless it's been multiple years. No bonus or yearly increase in the 5+ years I've been here. Even with really good annual reviews you will not receive a raise.
Advice to Management
Middle management understands that they are stuck with not being able to incentivize their team and it results in them losing their best contributors to other companies who offer better compensation with at least equal to greater benefits. Upper management needs to change the culture and communicate that the high turnover for most teams is costing the company more and also creating a bad culture of bitter employees. Internal growth is not nurtured and outside hiring is valued much greater as they come in at much higher wages with little to no experience compared to the internal employees.

The co-worker experience is phenomenal, a willingness to support each other and grow is second to none.
","Upper middle management has changed often bringing new visions for what things should look like. In a tech world that already changes at a very fast pace having a new vision every few months can make it even more frustrating. 
Lower management often does not have the knowledge level of their employees and can add to the day to day frustrations.

2020-09-09, Inside Sales Representative,"Burlington, MA","Current Employee, more than 3 years",Overall good place to work,"Oracle is a large company that for the most part takes care of it's employees. In a sales role there is definitely a bit of luck of the draw when initially taking over a territory. However, for the most part there is opportunity to make money if you work hard and do a good job of building relationships with your accounts. Don't buy into the hype of ""it's not a good territory so I can't make money"" because the person before you that had the territory may not have been good. The group of people I'm currently working for at Oracle are some of the best people I've ever worked for and truly care about their people. Overall it's a good company to work for and allows you to build a resume to move onto other strong companies if that's what you want or move up the ranks within Oracle.
","Coming into Oracle you don't have a choice of who you work for and there is a big difference between the good and bad managers at Oracle. 
Filling open territories isn't always done in the fairest/best manner. For example: you may have someone leave a territory that is a very good one and rather than offer that to a hard working team member that currently doesn't have the best territory they often hand it to a new rep.
Advice to Management
Promote from within if possible and deserved. Recognition of strong performers/performances is critical and seems to have dwindled since we started working remotely. Communication on promotional opportunities could be better.

Pros
It's been too long - not sure if I remember the positives. Overall enjoyed the sales teams I supported and my fellow ASCs. Very young office, which can have good/bad implications.
Cons
Management was very untrustworthy & not supportive of overall career development. Would do things like ask about future goals and then used non-Oracle goals against you during performance evaluations. Underperforming (mostly male) peers were promoted ahead of me. Often felt like I was tasked with administrative duties (i.e. plan quarterly team activity) because I'm a woman. Lack of diversity in Austin office - was often the only one of my race and/or ethnicity.

Advice to Management
Management should support and promote more diversity within management team, hardly people manager existent. Only support given is to likeminded people. As much you go for visibility as much you will get heard and supported by management no matter if the skills are really backed up or if its truly just a visibility approach. 
A split between license and cloud business have been made lately which concurs a competition between the reps and managers, however this is wanted and promoted! Management is always requesting for more but in return never gives back, for example 6 months in homeoffice still now allowance given. We are told to put shoeboxes under our laptops to grant ergonomie. 
Salaries, if you are longer with the company salaries are compared to the market not competitive however new hires do get better packages which leads to more senior reps to leave (since promotions are very rare).

Very hard to get fired
Cons
Management is terrible, buggy products. Product vision is a joke. Lack of management talent. No merit or yearly increases. Promotion process is a joke. Its not what you have done, its what you might do.
Advice to Management
Fire yourselves and stop thinking you area a leading tech company. Start compensating employees properly. The buildings in redwood say everything, big silos.

2020-09-02, Project Leader,Hyderābād,"Current Employee, more than 5 years",Good overall company but salary hikes is a real problem,"- Good and smart team members
- Awesome work life balance
- Nice and helpful managers
- Almost no micromanagement 
- Team members are generally helpful 
- Leave policies are good and very easy to take leaves
- Products are moving now faster (from last few years) and the focus has shifted to build something new and useful for customer rather than sticking to very old UIs and frameworks.
","- Internal frameworks are used like ADF which are not at all used anywhere else and there is very less documentation around that
- Internal softwares like jdev / ADF are slow and buggy 
- Many products are still built using Java6 which is almost 10+ years old now and they are unable to move to java 8+ because of the messed up dependencies between products.
- Architecture is completely monolith and although they have started moving towards microservices architecture, it is going to take easily 5 -6 years more for them to release a full fledged product.

Let's talk about the worst con of all : Pay and pay struture
- There is no pay limit for a particular role and hence one SE can be paid 6 LPA and other can be paid 16LPA for same role in same team.
- Freshers are paid more than most of the seniors (<~7 yrs), so someone working from last 7 yrs(Proj Leader) will be getting paid less than a IIT fresher(App Engineer).
- There is no hike cycle literally so employees just keep guessing all the time and even managers have no idea about anything.
- No hikes after promotion
- Hikes in general are also low (<10%) that too once in 2 years if you are lucky.
- No Bonus
- No stock for atleast 5 years and the situation can be random, they can give 600 units(~25 L) of RSUs to a fresher and you get nothing even though you are working from last 5 years.
Advice to Management
There is an urgent need to do something about this pay gap and other related issue.
Please start working on streamlining the process.

Someone working from long is usually very good in internal frameworks like ADF/JDEV etc and it takes a lot of time for a new hire to understand these things (atleast 6 months). So it would be best if management think about few people who are brilliant and still working for oracle.

Pros
Lots of interesting projects, opportunities for go-getters, great group of people, great work-life balance. Lots of opportunities to grow.
Cons
The focal (regular time when raises and promotions happen) gets delayed or canceled in recent years so it's hard to get promoted or even just raises to match inflation even for top performers. Most real talent is forced to leave if they want competitive salaries longer term. Slow to adopt new tech too, but that's not always a bad thing.
Advice to Management
Starting compensation is competitive, but there needs to be more capabilities for managers to give raises or bonuses to engineers. Don't keep skipping focals.

There are *some* good people left, but that is more a reflection of the people than the company.
","Quick to RIF when their ""numbers"" are not matched. Process adherence is only used asa beating stick with those who are not ""pals"" with management - the metrics are faked/massaged/fudged to the point of falsehood and irrelevance, yet still used for ""business decisions"" and to make managers ""look good"" (I hit my numbers! See? Are you not entertained?). Very shady and unethical. Engineers told to ""play in the grey area"" on a weekly basis.

If you're looking for real, objective performance reviews on an annual basis or even cost-of-living increases, go elsewhere - the ""reviews"" are a checkbox exercise for managers, and nothing is invested in the professional growth of a top-talent individual. 

Pay? Right - they pay the minimum - far below the industry average.

Upper-Management Integrity? Nope - they will either obscure the facts or flat-out lie to a customer just to make themselves look better. This is across the boards, all management teams, as if they have a mandate from above their pay grade to do so.

tl;dr - This is where careers go to die. Avoid at all costs.
Advice to Management
Stop playing favorites and politics. Promote, train, and evangelize your top talent as opposed to those who treat everything as a checkbox. Value human capital over falsified numbers and the perception those faked numbers generate at upper levels.

Who am I kidding - Oracle is *not* the kind of operation to actually do something that makes *sense*.

Pros
It is a springboard

Oracle in CV is great if you want to work in the IT/Tech/Software area.

You can learn the basics for sales.
Cons
The managers were simply incompetent and apart from empty words there was basically only pressure.

The mood was mostly depressed to resigned.

About 80% of the employees have openly engaged in the job search during working hours. 

There was also applause and a lot of joy when someone was able to get a job with another company.

At the beginning of the quarter the people who worked well in the last quarter were awarded. However, most of the time people actively cheated to reach their quarterly target.

Personally, I have had to struggle with sleep problems and my absolutely negative mood in the last months. This was also a reason for change for me. During my time there I started to do a lot of sports to reduce the stress. I have losT about 7-8Kg in the time there.
Advice to Management
Please hire people who are at least a little bit familiar with the topics ERP/software, IT, cloud etc. University dropouts and dazzlers are not the kind of people you can build a good BDG organization on.

This concerns both the management itself and the BDCs.

","You compete not just with competence but with other people inside Oracle, and that is not fair that someone from the same Company tries to steel your customer you have been working with and that tdamages the relation with customers.
You cannot built long term relations with customers because each year they change your territory.
Advice to Management
To increase customer´s satisfaction and win customers´loyalty its important to keep a good service and to maintain some continuity in the sales people for at least 2 years. 

If they are changed continuously it doesn´t give a good message to customers because it doesn´t guarantee them they could have a person of trust, to gurantee them the services and the conditions they have bought.

And also it gives the sales people a bad message, because they would be interested not in win customers loyalty but just to win deals to achieve their goals but they don´t feel compromised with customer´s needs and expectations because they know that when the year ends, they will manage a new territory.

And the image of the company would be damaged if the customer realizes that they were only used to achieve some goals.

- Boys Club. Not many women make it to Corporate or Senior Account Executive roles. Almost all leadership is men, and they play hard favorites.
- Unattainable quotas. Quota is pretty much a joke in our vertical. I have not hit quota once in my 3 years, and I am still a top half performer on our team of ~34 reps.

Stop rearranging business units and cutting people to shore up the bottom line. Invest in the talent you have starting with the frontline dev and support people. And actually hire managers and directors that know how to manage people, not numbers.

Pros
100% remote options available to those that prove themselves (otherwise you are on the road), very little micromanaging, can generally work whenever you want as long as you get the project in by deadline, nice equipment
Cons
Pay is lower than market averages, no yearly performance reviews, raises are given at 1-2% of current salary (so once you are locked into a salary you are stuck there), managers rarely know the technology to help out with troubleshooting and customer complaints- only know how to invoice and bill and put pressure on those below them to invoice and bill. Sales team is poorly trained and make the same mistakes when selling equipment and service over and over. Sales, consulting, and support are constantly blaming each other for customer issues instead of working together.
Advice to Management
Pay at or above market value to retain top talent, implement training programs instead of just expecting people to get it, provide more comprehensive support plans for customers instead of just billing them for more consulting hours

","Worst time card system ever. Horrible old, 1990's interface and buggy. Senior level managers have no interest in employee retention, or cultivating straight forward, open relationships. Old school. Overall company talks the talk, but can't walk the walk of ""caring"" about humans in general. Heavy meeting culture.
Advice to Management
Really needs to work on culture development as a company and top down leadership feels non-existent. Seems like the majority of high salary is made by sales (which also has a very high turn over rate) and I worked with persons who hadn't had a raise in 4 years, but always were told they were doing a great job. Lower managers are very limited in what they can do to help employees.

Life Balance is up because you end up doing nothing
","old technology that made locally (Slow VM)
ADF framework is the worst you can use for development(full of bugs and instead of development you end up try to make work first before you start development)
ADF uses java but you end up doing mouse clicking and everything will be done for you so you don't get experience of coding things.
Use ADE instead of git (ADE is made at oracle as well and it is suck)
PLSQL which SQL with little twist. real Don't need it since it won't help you if you want to leave later on.
In general Stay away from this company

Cons
Bonus is contingent on how the company performs, which during covid was sub par
Everyone is kind of in the same boat as far as experience so it doesn't seem like a typical job job
If you don't like corporations then this isn't for you. I did not like the idea but was willing to check it out to see what the deal was and realized I did indeed not want to work for a corporation.

Promotion path is not as clear as stated upon signing but it opens the door to a lot of other opportunities within sales.
Advice to Management
A lot of things are done for office politics reasons. Your brand is very important but there are underlying things done within the company that don't make the company any money but just promote other people's brands that are corporate hierarchy motivated.

","No raises, Ridiculous Targets, Politics, Poor Managers
Advice to Management
Make it clear to people when you hire them what the annual raise process is. Most candidates don't bother to ask and if they do they are given some vague answer about performance. The truth is there is no process for annual raises as Safra Catz believes its a privilege to work for Oracle. That's the main reason people leave - the compensation becomes uncompetitive. Middle management is poor, have no power. My first 15 managers (yes 15) at Oracle were either fired or made redundant. Oracle don't seem to understand that wages need to go up with inflation - but they really understand how to increase targets every year while reducing a salesperson's patch. This dinosaur of a company likes to think they have reinvented themselves for the cloud but in reality it's lipstick on a turkey. They have a group called OWL - Oracle Women's Leadership - Oracle needs to disband it because it's creating victimhood in women before they even start working. Oracle have some amazing people - male and female but OWL is divisive and counter-productive.

Never observed any role of HR, except your exit interview. Never get a chance to interact my HR.
Advice to Management
Make employee growth policies more robust and clear.
Make HR role more clear and give some power to HR.
Put some audits on managers they behave ike God father.
Listen to employee on quarter basis or yearly basis and take action on it.

2020-08-03, Applications Sales Representative,,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Corporate Politics, Internal Competition, Little Support from Managment","Class of training is extremely thorough and provides good sales foundation. Great way to build professional network. Immediate experience interacting with key executives at customer accounts. Looks good on a resume and provides professional experience.
","Company is structured so there are minimum 10 Oracle reps mapped to the same account, causing a lot of internal competition and conflicting incentives - this ultimately causes a lot of frustration for customers and rarely puts customer interests first. 

Most sales reps have large egos, making collaboration difficult even if you try. Oracle puts a lot of pressure on sales to meet challenging quotas/kpis, so everyone is so busy if you ask for help you're very aware of taking away people's ""precious and valuable time"". Company culture is similar to 'bro culture' in a college fraternity.

Management asks a lot of their teams in terms of activity, pipeline, closed deals, and additional trainings/projects, but are so overwhelmed themselves they offer reps virtually no support when help is needed. Activity expectations are unrealistic, focusing only on calls when reps have communicated countless times that emails and linkedin are significantly more successful mediums. 

Also, career development is challenging, with managers often keeping employees in roles for a minimum of 12-18 months and discourage employees from networking/exploring next roles before then. No HR support either - in the internal system under 'my designated HR rep' only information is a 1-800 HR support line.

- Could not think of any more pros
Advice to Management
Everyone should get a course work on professionalism. Politics is way too much for hard working people to grow in the organisation. Extreme compensation difference between developers and managers. Absolutely no growth in the company. It still has its name for using older technologies.

Pros
Benefits are one of the best out there (I think so).
Work-life balance depends on the project. There are some which requires you to overtime on holidays, rest days, etc.
People around are quite nice.
Cons
I am just working for the company for 2 years. But there are so many to mention that the company should fix on their management.
Very slow career growth. You will not be promoted even if you deserve it.
They will not try to support you on your interest/passion for other domains.
Politics somehow exists. If your PM has a favorite employee, they will not try to recognize you.
They are not investing in their in-house-trained employees, they prefer outsiders.
They are using ""OLD"" technologies. They do adopt to latest, NOT AT ALL.
Advice to Management
Learn to value your in-house-trained employees.
Recognize those people which are deserving for their talents.
Remove that small ""Politics"" culture, because if not, it will grow that much.

2020-07-30, Senior Applications Engineer,Hyderābād,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",This company is not about pay and related benefits,"For most of the teams, the work pressure is lower compared to other contemporary companies.
Management usually is open for new ideas to improve productivity.
Good culture for WFH, though no official policies are present, with a valid case there are usually no questions asked.
","Have no proper logic of pay increase. The increase in pay for a regular employee will never even meet the basic inflation rate. Hugely dependent on the immediate management even for these minimal benefits. Folks usually resort to reducing their performance for the same and company is usually fine with this unless it impacts deliverables very severely.
No pretense of any additional goodies or encouragement for high performers.

Techstack is primitive in most teams. And the struggle is always there for a minor improvement in this.
Advice to Management
Due to the way management is treating pay , this company has began to become just a bargaining chip for prospective employees who just attend interviews here and use the salary for negotiating for a better company. So many brilliant minds have left. Instead of thinking of 1000 unnecessary reasons on why the company is loosing its reputation and reach, concentrate on compensating your employees better and in updating your tech stack.

People are always shouting and speaking poorly of others. Use of profanity among leaders is very common. The cafeterias sell overpriced food. Worst place I have ever worked in my life. Unless you are a director, you do not get a company phone but managers expect you to answer your personal phone at all the times, even if that means paying for minutes and data out of your own pocket. These are the reasons Finance departments have very high turnovers. Morale is really low and managers give out the vibe that they do NOT care and if you don't like the way things are, you may leave. There is no recognition, no appreciation. The Finance systems they use are old school. Practically every week, they are coming up with new logics for their Finance planning tools. No technological help when system breaks, and you have to chat with someone in India or in Singapore to get things fixed (which most of the time they do not know how to fix), which in turn, makes you work overtime with no pay. They hire from outside mostly and takes forever to hire people. Not the most talented pool of senior leaders I have worked with. Unlimited PTO is a joke, because you are not allowed to take time off. Your Manager will get upset if you ask for time off and remember they don't pay you extra for not taking time off. Cheapest company I have ever worked for.
Advice to Management
If you don't care about your employees, you must know that your employees should not care about you either.

2020-07-24, Account Manager,"Dublin, Dublin","Current Employee, more than 1 year",If you have experience don't go there,"Well as you can imagine there aren't many if you're an experienced sales rep:

1. The tech is really good especially on cloud 
2. You meet some nice people
3. training

If you're a young sales rep with almost no experience then why not but tell yourself that you can do better. Still it's kind of a good line on the CV.:

But most young people leave after a year because other IT companies in Dublin offer more incentive and have better work policies.

Work life balance is actually pretty good because nobody actually cares.
","Well first of all Oracle is a big machine but with a management strategy that was efficient during the 1900. They invested huge amounts of money in R&D which enabled the company to have amazing tech but they left out everything that's human in that strategy.

You will only be a fish in the endless sea of bureaucracy. 

The com plan is not adapted to our cloud business as we don't have the same volumes as Azure or AWS. 

only 10 to 20% of sales achieve. So if you want to put in a lot of work for crumbs, you're welcome. 

Sales cycle are quite long so if you don't have a good territory don't expect to do a lot of sales here.
Advice to Management
Management and especially top management should start thinking about the well being of their employee and especially on employee attrition as more and more people are leaving the boat ! Especially the talents. 

It's too bad as it could be a great company and it still has the potential to become one but they would need to completely turn everything around.

Pros
Autonomy, management leave you to get on with your work with minimal interference. The team are very nice & helpful & will support you in your work whenever needed. The work can be interesting, a lot of very clever and motivated people who are generous with their knowledge. Great opportunities to pursue further education & learn.
Cons
Labyrinthine, the place is huge so its very hard to feel part of something. No room to move around the company (despite what you may be told) - you get stuck in your role indefinitely and hit a ceiling after a few years & there is nothing your direct manager can do (they hit a wall with upper management) . Negotiate hard on entry; pay rises are few and far between - a parsimonious company.
Advice to Management
Try to foster staff and understand what they want to achieve from their jobs. Don't view them as people who will inevitably leave - but as long term investments.

Advice to Management
It's great to realise that every GBU/region is totally segregated and their management can take up decisions for that specific vertical. But do you not think it is needed to have a definite hike for a specific period?
Also, in the recent townhall, the speaker informed us about how our partner companies were able to implement our products fast and better. It is absolutely because most of those people are your people only and since you are not able to retain them, they moved they there are implementing faster from your partner companies. It's really unfortunate that you don't have managers who are courageous enough to ask their bosses for the welfare of employees.

Repor","It's great to realise that every GBU/region is totally segregated and their management can take up decisions for that specific vertical. But do you not think it is needed to have a definite hike for a specific period?
Also, in the recent townhall, the speaker informed us about how our partner companies were able to implement our products fast and better. It is absolutely because most of those people are your people only and since you are not able to retain them, they moved they there are implementing faster from your partner companies. It's really unfortunate that you don't have managers who are courageous enough to ask their bosses for the welfare of employees.

Well organised on-boarding and introduction trainings.
Good repository- up to date documentation. 
The team I was part for the almost 3 months as employee, was very nice and supportive. They are experienced individuals, they help each other and managed to build a strong and beautiful relationship.
","My perm contract got terminated just few days before probation period ending time, due to a top management strategic decision (apparently triggered by the Covid 19 impact).
 However, the workload within the team and the volume was continuously increasing and my role supposed to be a replacement and not a new opening. 
No other job option was offered.
The communication of the termination was made in a conference call and no written letter or reason was given.
Lots of other people were laid off during last few weeks.

2020-07-15, Sales Representative,Madrid,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","A customer centric company does not start from the customers, it starts from the CEO","Some of the best reasons to work for Oracle are you have really great people with a lot of experience, and depending on the team, but generally people are very nice and there is a friendly atmosphere. Great name for your CV, Oracle is one of the best known companies in the world and they have a vast number of resources available to employees. You can move internally to different countries, there are many volunteering opportunities and you can work with some of the best companies as your clients. There is also a lot of learning available, courses and all is paid for by the company. So overall these stand out as the positive.
","There is, unfortunately a toxic culture, this means that you have to sell sell sell at no cost, even if you are selling your customer something that is not needed you will try to push this as this is the style and what is it shown internally. There is little to no room for salary improvement, I have been there for more than 3 years and there is no rise unless you change your job/department completely and even though that would be minimal raise. The company is fragmented and layered, you barely get the customers view to top management because they just wont listen, completely hierarchical.
Advice to Management
As much as some 1st and 2nd line managers might try to help their team, they are tied hands down by management above, so there is little to no improvement unless change starts from the top. A customer centric company does not start from the customers it starts from the CEO

Down to earth, hard working individuals always striving to work together and deliver on common goals. Management doesn't micromanage you and trusts you to get your work done. Since there's no hand holding there's also a lot of flexibility so it's important to be self-driven.
","In the 5 years I worked there, I didn't receive a single review even after submitting my self-evaluations. It doesn't really seem to matter though, because raises and bonuses are pretty much nonexistent. I once was rewarded a bonus, but then found out a couple of weeks later the company was revoking everyone's bonus. Sadly, I think a lack of raises is a common thing across the board. Many of my colleagues and superiors that I spoke to had never received a raise. It's a shame because there are so many talented people working there.
Advice to Management
Please value your employees more. People would love the opportunity to grow their careers with you if you'd be willing to invest in the hard work they do.

2020-07-01, Senior Account Manager,Singapore,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",Clash of the titans,"There are pockets of great culture within different teams, and different lines of business. The training is second to none, and they provide you with so much material. It's not difficult to get recognition if you show your efforts of collaboration and networking throughout the company. Benefits and commission is structure is very good - if you negotiate well for it before you get the job offer. Quarterly team recognitions which helps boost team morale.
","It's stagnated professional development - when you get a job, expect to be in the same role and same pay for a minimum of 3 years unless you threaten to leave (and even then you need to prove that you are invaluable). Managers do provide support, but you need to ensure that you are holding them accountable as well. Very process driven, so it can take weeks to get something done. The brand perception is an outdated grandfather's company, but marketing is trying to change that (which is a feat in itself).
Advice to Management
Reward your employees when they do perform. Managers should be more involved with groundwork instead of redirection. Reduce the processes - you're losing customers and employees out of frustration.

Doing well in the job is pretty much based on territory assignment and the product you sell. Management is bias and favors those employees that fake their numbers. I get it, it's sales but there is no integrity/ quality checks instilled by upper management. Not a good work environment because it will take parts of your soul. Get in and get out!

","First off, this job has made me question weather I even want to be a software engineer any more.

This WAS a fantastic place to work when I started. Since then it has just gone steadily downhill. When I started, the team I worked with was great. Smart, motivated people, who would band together to solve very exciting and complex engineering problems. 

When I started, I got the feeling that this was not the typical lean management type shop, and managers really wanted to grow a strong team, and were focused on developer experience, work life balance, and created an exciting environment with lots of good work to go around. 

Today as I write this review, I am counting down the days until my next round of vesting so I can get out of this place like a bat out of hell.

An engineer on my team recently expressed concerns about the ops burden, and an almost complete inability to work on anything other than ops and putting out fires. The response from management was, in not so many words, ""tough sh!t."" The people that have been hired recently have been producing work of a quality so low, that I honestly am embarrassed to call them my co-workers. The new projects coming down the pipe are depressing, and even those are getting put on hold because we constantly have to put out fires. My manager has been relegated to nothing more than a bearer of bad news, and that is a shame because he is honestly one of the best people I've ever worked with, and someone I have grown to consider a good friend. The code review process that use to be thorough, helpful, and very effective, is consistently being circumvented by cliques of low quality developers who work completely within their own circles. The result is code quality so low that I'm consistently struggling to resist the urge to toss my computer out the window. I recently saw a conversation with one of our veteran engineers, who was trying to wrap his mind around a seemingly poor design decision, to which his only response was to simply leave the chat group. I can only assume this was because he would have otherwise been unable to keep it professional. And our good engineers are so burnt out, that they just don't have the energy to try and correct these problems.

And not least of all, the people that seem to be getting promoted, are the people who focus on getting promoted, and not on doing a good job (with a few exceptions). The people who are more focused on contributing to their own success, rather than contributing to the success of the organization. And that is a shame.

And also, COVID-19 problems negate any of the pros related to the office and its location.

All in all, my recommendation is, don't get sucked in. They may try to sell you on some of the good qualities and core values that we use to have, but in reality, OCI has turned into another mediocre big development shop, and if you're a good engineer looking to solve challenging problems. This is not the place for you. If you want to make money, and climb the corporate ladder, then by all means, apply.
Advice to Management
You can't build a team based on the numbers. It isn't always about efficiency, and you have to build a team based on people. The focus on efficiency, and the OBVIOUS lack of regard for the engineers (which I honestly don't think you realize is so obvious, and is laughable) is opening the flood gates. I expect that any good engineer is planning on getting out as soon ans they've collected their next round of shares. And I know of many engineers who I have spoken with personally that are planning on leaving as soon as they're next round of vesting. I spoke to one engineer who is mere months away from collecting his next round of shares, but doesn't even know if he'll be able to hold out. 

I'm pretty sure it's too late. I think you've already screwed the pooch. But, if you haven't, I suggest dramatically changing the way things are run, and seriously listening to peoples concerns rather than sending the suggestion box directly to the shredder. But like I said, with the code quality dropping so low so fast, I'm pretty sure there is no hope.

In the middle of a pandemic, Oracle has announced the support organization reorganization during which the accounts that have been nurtured for many years are being shifted to a whole new group. Talk about destroying the bottom line, alienating customers and rewarding workers (not). Think timing is coincidental when unemployment is rampant and there is no where to go? What a company.

2020-06-10, Business Development Representative,,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Good experience, terrible management, priorities misguided","Good experience and a great resume builder
","The company has grown too large and doesn't know how to be scaled. Too many bad experiences to count or say here. Company priorities are misguided and technology is outdated while refusing to change. The management cares more that your dashboard is clean and that your dial number is up more than actually selling anything. The rules they put you under are not there to help you, they do nothing but make your job harder than it already is to make management look better. Wastes of time, lack of communication, being treated like a child doing menial tasks in a college class, all while the fake Netsuite culture is being forced on you to make you think its the best company ever.
Advice to Management
Stop adding more and more rules, focus on teaching new hires to sell correctly. Being a good BDR does not make you a good salesman whatsoever. Stop prioritizing cheaters and liars. When entire teams of employees report management listen to them, a few days off doesn't make a terrible manager better. I've worked here for over a year and Ive looked for new jobs every week since I started because of management.

","0 interest in providing any stipend to employees to purchase work from home equipment during a global pandemic for months on end. Leaving those in the city to work on kitchen tables and couches with no monitors. No feedback loop what so ever leaving any hope of change nearly impossible. KPIs are stuck in the past and you are viewed as a cog in the wheel every day by those who aren't your direct manager. Extremely mendacious rhetoric from upper management thought to inspire and motivate reps. Ironically as a SaaS company, there are endless duplicate efforts and hours of manual data entry leaving little time to really sell. Hideous sales hub compared to others.

Pros
It is a very young environment. There is a lot of colleagues in their 20s so there is a lot of people who can relate to your experience. The pay is great for the work you are doing. If you meet the KPI and your metrics, bonuses every quarter is pretty decent. There is also a lof of resources that the company offers and you can utilize to your advantage.
Cons
Because it is such a big company, it can be very unorganized. The unofficial motto is ""the only constant is change"" but the changes at times are not implemented well. It can be really frustrating when there is absolutely no consistency for longer than 3 months. Depending on your manager, you might have to really go out of your way to learn something or find other opportunities for job progression.

Good managers will fight for you
","derable Remote workforce gives flexibility 
Average tenure is high in certain areas because of the decent work-life balance
Cons
* Tension between Field and Inside Sales orgs
* Internal politics slows deals and momentum. ex: you offer customers will take ages to get approved
* Tribal knowledge is key; you must know the right people to get answers to questions
* Competing priorities by teams; renewals / sales are compensated to be against each other
* Internal tools often buggy
* Aging management has old school mentality, ex: still believes in hub-model with butts in seat 
* Management hounds reps to make cold-calls daily to prospects/customers in the Enterprise space (cold-calls don't work anymore)
* You will be tracked on every metric. They fire the highest earners, so beware of hitting your quota for the year or you'll be the next one on the chopping block (C suite makes financial decisions, not smart business decisions)
Advice to Management
Shift the mentality to reward sales reps who bring revenue into the company and empower reps to ""own their territory"". Ditch the dial-for-dollars mentality at every level. Align field/inside teams through shared compensation model and fix the broken deal cutoff model that was taken from Salesforce.

It's like a welfare program for people who couldn't get hired at AWS or Azure. The snacks are pretty good.
","Management is the worst I've ever experienced in my 20+ year tech career. Mid-level to Senior management actively tries to screw over their staff, lies about them in performance reviews, and promotes anyone who surreptitiously complains about their teammates. It's a culture that rewards backstabbing, lying, cheating, and generally anti-social behavior.

OCI is 5-10 years behind every other cloud infrastructure provider in terms of their product offerings and customer value proposition. They're like a dinosaur flailing in a tar pit. Their constant re-orgs and layoffs only hasten the inevitable. Senior management's only plan is to cheat their employees, lie to their faces, and collect enough RSUs to bail out before the stock price tanks once Oracle runs out of cash for stock repurchases (look it up).

2020-05-05," Manager, Customer Success ","Burlington, MA","Former Employee, more than 10 years","Compensation Issues,","Generally top talent throughout the company, so one feels they are a part of an industry-leading team of professionals. 

The Cloud Customer Success organization was generally well equipped with talented support staff and leadership which made our work on the front lines a bit easier.
","Poor compensation management - if Oracle had its' way, and as is often the case, people progress their skills, increasing value delivered and responsibilities year after year, yet they don't get raises. Often promises are made by front line managers and directors which go unfulfilled due to a pervasive culture of not caring for the individual. 

Customer Success org gave far to much responsibility to ""class of"" young college recruits who are in their first job. A commendable use of staff when other resources are limited, but the absence of ""adult supervision"" was notable and a real detractor to those experienced staff and leaders who could deliver with the help of this staff. Instead, the focus was on empowering these newbies who have lots of energy but not real skills or experience.

Similarly, there's lots of public and internal marketing of Oracle as an company which cares for its' staff, but little evidence in reality.

Pay your staff who deliver. Ensure experienced leaders are in control of operational improvement programs, not the newbies alone with limited quality control.

Excellent professional culture, which helps in a chilled out work life so good work life balance. Most of the teams are flexible about timings and work from home as well.
","Biggest two cons are: Heavily, massively outdated tech stack and very rare hikes or financial growth. You have to be exceptional to get anywhere near a minimal hike in most of the orgs. Regarding tech stack, don't join oracle if you want to work on hot tech buzz. Oracle products are massively outdated in terms of UX and stuff. Even the tools like version control, ide etc are very specific to Oracle and not what industry uses.

- Good work place environment
- This could be seen as good or bad, workload isn't stimulating or challenging but it allows you the freedom to develop other skills / free time.
- Micro-managing isn't part of the company culture or identity, this is a big plus for me.
","- Your salary goes to Oracle to die. There are no annual reviews, no hikes, your starting salary will remain the same for years and years until you decide to leave. They know this, and they're okay with this. I've been told by Directors that Oracle is a learning experience, and you should take that experience elsewhere to get a pay rise. This should be unacceptable, but it's the not-so-secret secret that everyone knows and begrudgingly accepts.
- The freedom you enjoy to develop yourself and how you develop your work, as well as the great environment this creates, which is very important, is also used against you because upper management makes it clear it's their strategy to justify not increasing salaries.
- Because of this, there's some upward mobility because tenured people will leave sooner or later but there's also a big waiting list. If you've got the talent but there's people who have been there for half a decade, waiting for a chance, then tough luck, get in line. There's no clear career path and there's no intention for you to have one.
- HR doesn't exist, unless things get serious. You will never have contact with an HR representative in your tenure at Oracle, barring the starting period, and you should be thankful if you don't because HR is in place to protect the company and only the company.
- Upper management is an absolute old boy's club, completely out of touch. Their strategies are not working for many years now and Oracle is running out of small, profitable companies to buy. It is dying a slow death and they won't be able to afford losing tenured people in the future, or stop ignoring said acquisitions and customers.
Advice to Management
This is a cliche, but listen to your employees and your customers. You need specialists, you need happy customers. It's not hard, Oracle already has a good culture in place but it needs to be expanded to higher management.

","One of the worst employer , I have ever worked with. 

* They hire people whenever resources are needed and fire as soon as the work is done. * No Hike, no stock benefits, no bonus, no employee facility provided by the org. 
* Too many middle managers. Half of my team members were managers.
* No Technical Growth.

Review the HR policy on harrassment at work and set a Minimum standard action and follow up plan on all those harrassment at work cases across the WORLD since Oracle is a global company cum the local country regulations. 

HR policies with no stern action taken to all the harrassment cases it will set the culture of the company that harrassment at work is fine in certain regions. In most of the time HR will covers the top management who are the one who harass their staff and resulted that the employee who been harrass need to leave the company. Thanks

Some great people. In the early days it was fun; if you closed a deal you got paid on the 15th of the next month and they were very lucrative commissions. You can also move around quite a bit, get a variety of experiences.
","Bureaucracy can be brutal. They limit (cap) sales commissions and the comp plans are not what they used to be. Territories are very unequal. So much depends on whether or not your manager likes you and what accounts you get. Products need to be updated faster.

Lots of dog-eat-dog among the reps and managers. Larry pits teams against each other. I felt more fearful of internal teams than of my competition. It is a very mean-spirited culture in sales there. I was one of the top reps yet I hated it the internal fighting. At Oracle, you have to stand your ground and a lot of people won't like you if you do. People expect to be able to run over you and if you don't let them they diss you. Also, a lot of difficulties getting paid due to multiple people getting paid on a deal and a log time to get paid after a deal.

2020-04-06, Senior Director,"Redwood Shores, CA","Former Employee, less than 1 year",Potentially great employer... Ambitious w/high expectations w/o leadership or support.,"Excellent work/life balance. Good pay. Ok benefits. Worked with some really great people. The staff during the new hire process were amazing and that part of the on-boarding was fairly simple and well organized.
","Hired for expertise in the field. New team; new division; new employees to the company. Super high expectations. Leadership expected too much the moment folks got grounding. Didn't give enough time for tasks; didn't provide leadership or support. Too top heavy on higher titles. Lots of nepotism and favortism. New CEO cut sales and consulting roles without question or thought. Seems like a today thinker rather than a strategic one; also, been there too long so the CEO has become stale. No thought leadership.

New employees were told to find their network and build portfolios without the proper tools. Very archaic way of conducting business.

HR is not what is expected at a large company. Very hands-off; risk averse. Not supportive to the individual.
Advice to Management
If you hire experts, give them the tools and the time to make things happen. Don't eliminate roles and divisions without giving proper time and guidance. Rome wasn't built in a day so don't expect to succeed without failure. Also, work on your severance packages. Pretty pitiful for higher level executives. Also, make bonus and commission fair across the board. Take it out of on-boarding language as this particular area of business is unfair and shady.

","Very poor territory management. Be prepared to change territories and management every few quarters or yearly. You have a short amount of time to build relationships and close long deal cycles. But, if you work for the right management who understand how to manage this inflexibility of timelines and value your work, this is a great opportunity. 

You are mapped to an account with 80-100 other Oracle reps, and half of the accounts have multiple reps with the same product line attached to the account. So if you start a deal cycle with an account and the other product rep finds out about it, you and your management spend half the year fighting to keep 50/50 while upper management does not step in knowing the deal is coming in anyway. Then at the end of the fiscal year they change the territories again and you start all over. It's an issue at the operations level that has not changed in years. 

Customers largest complaints are too many Oracle reps calling them incessantly, and they don't trust Oracle's aggressive auditing practices.
Advice to Management
The culture built here is not built for relationship-based selling. The pressure you're putting on reps to become a trusted adviser to a client in 2-3 months is attainable if you focus efforts instead toward navigating the Oracle team internally to work together and let the rep focus on the customer.

2020-03-31, Sales,,"Current Employee, more than 10 years","You make what you put in, exactly like life is!","Leadership have goals that are clear, Management will put a strategy in place and will offer the tactics to fulfil these. If you have better tactics speak up and ask for investment and you will get it, have seen some silly ideas nurtured as well which is brilliant. Come up with a recipe or follow whats offered as gold standard. Plenty room, investment and support offered to test out ideas. 

Training and Support second to none, 

Training, Days, Months and Years worth free online training content available to suckle on. Most FLMs would almost NEVER say no to a training course if you have had it in your Personal Development Plan and aligns to the Goals set for yourself at the start of the year. Do contribute before you start demanding courses though. If you are prescribed a course by L&D, GO DO IT, there will always be 1 thing that you could pick up. 

 
Support. every FLM and Leader in OD, OU and BDG has real experience in Sales and has seen success at smaller or greater degree. There was a time when promotions were offered as confetti not any more, most first line managers are directly involved in deals which helps with internal and external selling. 

Exactly like life, you will find ups and downs! Like they say, calm waters never make a seasoned sailor!
","Pay rises are not known of, the only way to get pay rises is by over performing, making to club or get closer to quota/ target and make a pay rise an embarrassment for your Manager. 

Promotion doesn't always mean pay rise so negotiate well at the start of the tenure. 

Current circumstances [COVID-19] will test the digital-ability of Oracle Digital.
Advice to Management
Management are but executors of strategy however need to be louder in highlighting issues with the strategy to the Leadership. 

Recruiting: Had seen almost anyone passing probation of late, very few managers actually picking quality to move forward which may cause some real downers in and get in the way of progress. 


to the Senior/ Exec Leadership, 

think about the Prospects as well not just our current customers. Our LoBs have clashing sales strategies [No! it isn't called complete choice, the Market is looking at us for leadership and guidance not choice!], GTM gets so complex and prospects end up getting clashing priorities, bring back chocolate bar compensation and leave it for Management to Manage!

Investing in all these new acquisitions looks great in Goodwill as a line item on the Annual Report and employees take great pride in that too, but then when it comes to selling these newly acquired products, it is left to the same old sales team from the acquired company employees or GBUs, please, bring GBUs and Industry closer, let acquired products to be sold by all sales not just GBUs! JDE was a brilliant success in MSE, Netsuite will be a great one as well if the teams were cross pollinated. 

After all, employees are stakeholders of this company as well, not just Shareholders [bless em]. 

Measure Sales Reps on Sales if you pay them for sales. If you don't pay them for creating new Opps/ Relationships don't measure them on those. Many would take this as an excuse and underperform and some would thrive, why take the chance?

","Fusion HCM culture is rife with petty and small minded individuals. Quality employees don't stay because they are chased out. Micromanaging is counterproductive and a disincentive to the employee. A clear disparity exists between the Utah office and the Florida office. The Utah office is definitely not the favorite.
Advice to Management
Cut out one or two layers of middle management. Instead of middle management justifying their jobs through micromanaging, employees could be treated like professionals. Employees will then be empowered to do their job and Oracle will save money.

Keep an eye on the disparity in pay and work environment between men and women. There remains a substantial gap.

BDC/BDR role is desk bound and does a lot of cold-calling, no meeting with clients and no sales closing`. Essentially a telemarketing role, not as fancy as the title sounds. Always boasts about how it has amazing career opportunities for grads, but in reality and ironically, it doesn't have any in the sales function/it will take years before you can actually move up. Will also be difficult to find a new job within sales outside of Oracle bcs you technically don't learn how to close sale. Business model is structured in a way that creates a competitive environment, but toxic to the extent where a lot of backstabbing happens. Management changes all the time

","No pay raises. Promotions are only a bump up in title and responsibility. The HCM product is terrible compared to other products on the market. The culture and mindset for customer service is to shuffle SRs around and not hold anyone accountable. Support is held to a higher standard than development or product management, and the company is supportive of and embraces condescending and aggressive language depending on tenure. No one is provided with reliable resources to do the job at hand, and new hires are held to a more stringent standard than people who have been with the company. If you have morals, values, and ethics then this is not the right place for you.

2020-02-29, Senior Principal Product Manager,,"Former Employee, more than 10 years",Old reviews and ratings are outdated ........Company has deteriorated drastically,"- Good for women ( in the select teams though) who want to work FROM home (like attending meetings), while also working FOR home (say, cooking/washing utensils in the background while attending the meetings)

- Also good for men (in the select team), who have a working spouse and one of them need to reach home early to pick -up kids from the school bus

-- Also good for anyone who needs a brand name for future jobs prospects (as long as you don't commit a career-suicide by staying more than 2-3 years in Oracle)

- Multiple resources for free learning if you have time. Also options to nominate yourself for soft-skills training

- Process-oriented company, so you learn the development methodologies by actually using them against just theoretical knowledge.

- The quality of the recruitments are good. So most people are pleasant to work with.
","(1) Unfortunately, the rating here average both the recent and very old reviews, so the fact that the company has deteriorated in the last 5-7 years is not apparent

(2) There is NO CONCEPT OF HIKES once you join. Your first hike may itself get delayed by as much as 2.5-3.5 years or even beyond. Here are the reason:
(i ) An employee not considered for the first hike after joining
(ii) Hikes, in general, come one in 2 to 2.5 years (or more in troubled times)
(iii) Not everyone gets a hike. The ratio is 70:30 or 60: 40 (So in a team of 10 employees, only about 6-7 get hike, 3-4 dont). Generally, new employees are targeted to deprive them of hikes, since they are still to prove themselves, but it also depends on the manager's favoritism. Remember if you miss an increment cycle then the next one comes only after 2-2.5+ years. So how much do you lag behind the market now?
(iv) Even if you get a hike it is mostly a single digit (sometimes as low as 3-5%). But the company has manipulated everyone psychologically. For example, those getting a (minuscule) hike are so happy being considered for the hike that they forget that their peers in other companies getting much HIGHER increments EVERY year.
(v) The company fires a number of employees just before the hikes, so even those employees that don't get hikes (some times for 5-7 years at a stretch) are happy to save their job. Working in Oracle for more than 3 years has already made you misfit for the world outside

(3 The same above logic for Bonus and Shares. Mostly managers favorites ( mostly decided by the nationality/regional/language commonality) make it to the list..Other are filtered out from Bonus and Shares,

(4) There are frequent job-losses, but they are managed smartly so it does not make it to the media. Only those figures where a country's government mandatorily requires retrenchment figures land in the press. (For example, say the companies have employees across 250 floors of office space globally with a seating capacity of 500 employees on each floor, and 50 people are retrenched DAILY from random floors. Would anyone notice? But what is the lay-off figure for a month ? Especially since no communications are made to other employees, as most think that the employee is working from home.

(5) While the old reviews may talk otherwise, but because of job-loss panic, there is no work-life balance. In fact because of the recent mass-scale job losses people volunteer to stretch themselves.

(6) You are a misfit for the industry once you work here for more than 3 years. So you can take a clerical salary for the rest of your work-life and pray that you are not a victim of retrenchment in between...... It works this way- Despite aggressive press claims, the company lags behind in technology by 5-7 years from the industry. However, you cannot upgrade yourself by self-initiative either, since there is a heavy workload every day due to the panic over probable job-losses. So each future year you are behind the industry further, leading to a VICIOUS Cycle.. It is like joining an underworld gang : you can only join but you cannot leave.

(7) Though outwardly the company has pleasant culture, but no tricks from passive-aggression remain untouched inside.
Advice to Management
Focus on employees, instead of random unrelated acquisitions of other companies. There is a limit till you can ride on old glory, by keeping your employees unhappy.

2020-02-29, Senior Applications Developer,Thiruvananthapuram,"Former Employee, more than 3 years",Poor leaders and management. Has learning opportunities but not for long.,"You can get experience in how a big enterprise work and how organized a company can be. 
There is opportunity to learn about highly scaling applications but technically the learning will be stopped in one or two years because no new technology come up.
Very good work life balance. Less stress if you like a relaxed work.
","Leaders are crappy and are at the mercy of the director for deciding even the smallest things. Director is good at bringing work to trivandrum office but is not good at his approach to employees. Very judgemental and discouraging. Plays crappy games with employees. 
HR is non functional and very confused. When some issue arises, they don't know how to solve it in a good way and always try to favour the management, even when the employee has a valid point. Unless escalated, HR never hustles for the employee.

2020-02-26, Senior Customer Success Manager,"Boston, MA","Current Employee, more than 8 years",Stagnant big company with many useless layers of management.,"You have a job. You can work from home.
","Thanks for taking the time to read my review. I have been with Oracle for over a decade. I write this to give potential candidates a real look into the company. Someone who has been with the company 6-24 months may not have a very wide view since you are required to stay in a position for a year and people rarely leave their area. I have worked in several different areas in my time at the company. I came on as part of an acquisition. Good Luck! 

Training Development – In my over 10 years here, I have never witnessed any dedicated employee development. Part of management's job is to develop their employees, but that is completely non-existent. In the Global Business Units (GBU's) it's even worse. Oracle's latest “employee development” program literally has employees filling out word docs about their goals and such. Basically what people did in 1999. As for actual training, for the courses someone might need to improve in their jobs or become more skills, Oracle will charge you thousands of dollars to take them. In my years here, I had one training course that my unit paid for. With the advent of the cloud, you are able to get access to subscription learning. These are setup as videos for the most part, so you're just watching powerpoint slides go by and once you're done, there's no real reinforcement. In my time here I have not watched one person be developed from a hire to employee to management. Usually in a decade you would have one or two examples of progression. 

Management – There are many thick and useless layers of management. Many of them with very little technology and or real IT experience. When Oracle acquires smaller companies, if they are under the GBU framework, the company can basically say, a janitor is now a Senior Director and no questions are asked. I have watched scores of people come in that way and just leapfrog over people who have been in the unit for decades. It's even more embarrassing when the people who have been there basically know 10 times more about everything and the new member of management just sits around being social and not really contributing. I've also never seen the same members of management sit in the same exact positions for decades. These managers stay in office longer than presidents. Their attitudes are smug and many are downright hated by their team members. The thing is, you work in a tech company and you should know the buzz words or at least know what they mean. I have been in meetings where a director actually said to someone two levels below them that, “that's not their job to know how to do this or that...that's on you to know...” At Oracle, as opposed to many other companies I have worked at, to be in management, you do not need to have been good at any one particular job or the jobs of your team. It is truly amazing. My thought is they stay because no companies really want them. 

Salaries & Raises – as many have mentioned here, the lowest in the industry. I have watched people get lied to about money, I have watched colleagues be sold one job and think they were getting their “level” raise only for the manager to remove the job and create another job that was a lateral move. You are around some really scummy low down people. This is not like the big and successful tech companies. This is basically the lowest end of tech. With that being said, you need to do something remarkable to get any type of raise. You need to really beat everyone on your team and basically be perfect for 12 months. And even then, quite the stretch. Management that are friends with other managers will also have an impact on those things. I have gotten raises in my time here, but with salaries being so low, it's not a lot. As mentioned before, if you get in via an acquisition, you could get a nice bump from what you were making, but that's up for negotiation between Oracle and the old company. 

Work-Life Balance – The single reason I have heard anyone stays here is because they can work from home and get their work done in 4-5 hours a day. That's really the biggest benefit of the company and don't think anyone would argue. 

The Cloud – applications on the cloud were deployed with very little strategy or education to the employees. They will never catch the other tech companies that are staffed with better talent and management. Management wants to tout the cloud as being a success, but it's basically because customers are basically strong-armed into going to it and they are flat out lied to when speaking about the overall performance of the cloud. There is also a mentality among management and long time employees that Oracle is better than Amazon. Anyone who knows the tech sector right now, knows that's laughable. At Oracle, they can't even speak about their competition because they're getting beaten so bad. What's worse is that there are smaller companies that are now coming up that have better products, better platforms, cheaper price and less problems.
Advice to Management
- Turnover all levels of management. Managers should not be in the same positions for decades as it gives a perception of stagnation. If they can't do the job of the people they manage, they don't deserve to be manager. 
- Educate sales people on what they're actually selling prior to letting them sell. Make sales aware of what other groups are doing. 
- Develop and promote the people who strive to learn and grow instead of people who come in the back door who haven't proven themselves to anyone. 
- Going to have to increase salaries to keep top talent to compete with the real winners in tech space.

I can confidently say that my goals were met - but also that I've come to be even more excited about Oracle's future ahead. I knew Oracle had a strong history as a tech leader, but had no idea how revolutionary their technology really is. This is an exciting opportunity for a marketing professional - to help bring this story to life!

When you are a new hire you can have a deal above the market.

 People in HQ have a nice gym
Nothing else ...
","- It looks like Oracle bet everything on Cloud. Only OCI people are appreciated, if you are going to non-OCI department, especially if it is legacy product, I would really doubt about accepting an offer. Other departments are non-appreciated.
- If you are not OCI you will struggle to get salary increase. Get raise in Oracle it is always painful quest, ask employees. Having no hikes for years it is absolutely normal here. When you once receive 3%-6% after 3-5 years it will be shown as a great privilege. After 5 years salary becomes about twice bellow the market. Oracle does not care, if you you are non OCI
- Oracle notorious for bad management. It is random you never know who it will be. I had good and bad experience. I worked for 2 departments: at the 1st one I had nice environment, at 2nd one I was shocked to see how such kind of people could take management position in Oracle. How it 's happened, cronyism? One moment, I was about make complains to HR but realized that would not helped, even made things worse. Although if you are in OCI most likely it will be fine. Because Oracle is cares about OCI.
- You could work with legacy technologies, outdated stack. Ask more thoroughly on the interview about the project. On the interview it was shown as a interesting project, the reality turned out the different. 
- Many people mention good WLB in Oracle, it depends on the team for sure. I was not lucky to appeared in the good one.

Parents Health Insurance is not covered here.
Advice to Management
You should give minimum hike to every employee by comparing their salary package with market standard.
Parents health insurance should cover for unmarried employees. 
If not there should be a choice to select lower package which will come with minimum amount for insurance premium.

","New management treats employees like commodities that can be replaced with cheaper overseas labor and new college recruits. Employees have to jump through hoops to meet new quarterly ""report card"" management strategy. Even then, employees with excellent ratings have been cut for cheaper replacements they train.
Advice to Management
Methods to replace US workers with offshore workers are reprehensible, affecting employee morale. Sales targets are being missed consistently because you have replaced your seasoned staff with less cable, cheaper workers. You sow what you reap.

","Customers HATE Oracle so no one wants to talk with you. Biggest drivers of revenue - audits and support cost increases&lock-in. Oracle Cloud is a complete bust. No innovation, zero strategy and complete lack of execution. When you do sell something good luck getting paid. Commissions are always late, always smaller than you expect and always require a dispute inquiry by the seller. However since only 1 out of 20 reps are hitting their numbers this isn't much of a problem. Overall, it's a horrible time to be at Oracle and it's only going to get worse with Safra in charge. She's the financial engineering guru so expect more layoffs and department cuts to make numbers.

Everything is celebrated team environment is awesome. Really learn how to sell your product with trainings and development. Mark Hurd really cared about the class of program I wonder how it’ll change with safra
","Promotions. Make sure you do your research before you select or apply for a team. Product can be difficult to sell due to internal politics 

Biggest advice at Oracle is protecting your brand. Longest man standing usually gets the promotion because it’s been way over due. You usually have to leave the company to comeback to get the salary and position you wanted.

Promote from within really give your class of’s the opportunity to rank up and advance vs holding seats and hiring for roles externally. I was interviewing for multiple field roles while an OS yet didn’t get the roles due to experience yet leave to a smaller SaaS company and I’m the #1 field rep for new company. Really wish Oracle just gave me a shot because I was truly drinking from the Larry Kool Aid bc Oracle opened up so many doors for me in my career & leadership that I was trying to advance myself too. Pay your employees better bases. 50 isn’t cutting it especially in Austin, Santa Monica, Boston etc. 

Quit changing comp structure.

-They have call competitions among the BDR's but everyone is logging fake phone calls to win. 
-BDR's ""cheat"" to hit quota, working leads that are not in there territory.
-AE's misrepresent the annual revenue of leads they are working so that it looks like they are in their territory. This fosters a hostile work environment with AE's fighting over leads and arguing with BDR's.
-The BDE team is an absolute joke, the meetings they put on for the BDR's are time sucks and not at all valuable. 
-They hire more BDR's than they have the bandwidth to promote, pushing out many BDR's once their year is up. Churning and burning through sales employees.
Advice to Management
Ensure employees are following territory rules. Lower daily metrics to prevent fake calls being logged. Address hostile employees, stop allowing AE's to disrespect BDR's. Get rid of the entire BDE team or do something to improve it and make their mandatory meetings actually valuable.

Advice to Management
Direct Management is stellar. I have dealt with several from my own teams I've worked on to interacting with other teams for things. I have never had a complaint about the direct managers over techs. Even to the extent of pointing out a problem they unknowingly caused. There was no backlash or petty response. Regional management, is sometimes out of touch. Though a new one did get installed recently and seems to care more about day to day activities and improving Oracle for the techs so the techs can do their jobs easier. 

I honestly have no advice right now. Management in the chain I am in is great!

The second reason is the amazing work culture, with frequent team lunches and outings.
The Bangalore office is amazing, with beautiful cubicles , several chill out areas and even a nap room.
","One of the major downsides of working at Oracle is the poor hike given to the employees. Even after working for 3 years, one may end up with just 4-5% hike. 
Secondly, they rely on old technologies.

2020-02-09, Oracle Direct Sales Account Manager,"Dublin, Dublin","Current Employee, more than 1 year",Cannot be sustained. Do not join Oracle to sell applications,"You'll work with some wonderful colleagues, impossible to be fired, decent benefits package, products are good
","Isolated location with few amenities.
You will NEVER receive a pay raise... The lies start at your recruitment process, proceed during your interviews and continue throughout your 'career' at Oracle.
""If you're not lying, you're not trying"". This is the ethos of Oracle Dublin. 

You cannot be successful here based on your own merit and talent as your territories, deals and commissions are all at the hands of a deeply corrupt and narcissistic management team. 

The only corporate sponsored training that managers receive is a workshop in how to behave in court while being sued for screwing reps out of commission (Seriously). They are completely out of touch with the technology they are selling and the customers they are selling to. There is absolutely zero strategy. Management will force their way into customer engagements just to be ""seen"".... This more often than not ends in disaster as senior management are known as ""deal killers"" (true story).

Morale is extremely low at Oracle Dublin. You will not be interviewed on the sales floor because management do not want you to see the empty chairs. The sales floor is like a library. Turnover is shocking. 

Managers lock themselves in meetings for hours a week. In my nearly 3 years I have never seen any productive output of these meetings... Zero. It's a clown car. 

In apps there is approximately 1 manager for every 2 reps. So you'll be drawn into ridiculous 1on1's and meetings about meetings so that they can justify their positions and salaries and be seen to be busy. 

Back stabbing is rife. 
Collaboration is a dirty word because of this.

Internal resources are hard to come by at Oracle... There is a lot of red tape just to get any help with a client. 

You'll rely heavily on partners because knowledge and expertise does not exist inside of the building... even though many people have between 10-30 years of experience. They are only talented at justifying failure each quarter. 

Oracle does not like to pay commissions for honest work. You will be screwed (see management training).
Advice to Management
Oracle Digital Apps should be shut down. It is a completely failed experiment. A result of gross incompetence from the management team.

EPM, HCM and SCM should be sold 100% through the partner chanel.

ERP with the field in UK. 

Your lack of desire to improve as professionals is a disgrace to people who care about the company and their own personal development.

","Bullying culture ignored by some managers. Reflected poorly on managers priorities of this not being a concern as it was raised numerous times. Understand that HR only took action to terminate employment of misconduct/Sexual harassment case of a particular employee but this was done way too late. Should have been dealt with within a couple of weeks instead of 7 months of negative culture accumulating. Highlights poor management hierarchy.

","- Low increment in salary. I joined two years back. Got salary incremented only once (for all members in the team), and that too in low single digits.
