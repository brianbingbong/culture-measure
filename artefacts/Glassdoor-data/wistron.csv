","- Racist hiring policy gives SEA employees less holidays and salary than their western, more white, colleagues.
- Poor management and HR means if you have any issues, you're on your own. 
- Due to the fact that you are a contractor, you never get any benefits of working for the company you are investing your time into.
- Outdated and childish HR policy stances (Limiting bathroom break time, time away from desk, sick leave, and etc.) 
- No outlook for future career growth. There was little or no chance to improve yourself, no upward mobility, no path for a promotion. 
- Pay is below industry standard
- Poor health insurance
- Below average paid annual leave amount.
- Job nature is boring 
- Hostile and catty work environment
- Absent management
Advice to Management
- One of the biggest issues with management was the lack of proper communication. You would think that a company like WISTRON who hires an international team of people who speak English as our core language, would have managers who were fluent in English, NOPE. Communication with management was nonexistent and dismissive. Some of our managers didn't even speak English.
- Our team had a manager, who had resigned. Wistron never replaced her and left the office without a manager for months, which caused CHAOS in the office. Don't do this, nothing can get done if everything needs to be communicated by emails or business travels from Taiwan to the office. We need an on-site manager!
