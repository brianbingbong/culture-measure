","1. For single change in code, 
For ex changing int value of any macro you have tones of document to edit
2. Most of the review comments to your change are related to how you have framed sentences in document or release note of your code and they misses simple mistakes of developer!
3. Focus is on Japanese process than innovation and intelligence
4. I don’t want to blame anyone but the Japanese management, where they do not follow any guidelines and force Indian team to work on guidelines.
5. Issues are assigned in morning by team and expected to get debug status by evening
6. I don’t understand why people are saying excellent technology and all,
You get the code from Japanese team and asked to edit few values or change some behaviour 
Edit tones of documents for them and release it to the Customer.
7. No RSU
8. Japanese pressure
Advice to Management
My advice will not make any difference for sure.
But please hire a content writer and ask him/her to edit all your documents than wasting precious time of developers whom you are paying.
Think about innovations and new stuffs than old methodologies.
Bring newer tools than working on traditional ways of debugging.

Also look at investing in real marketing repair the brand name.

2021-03-16, Field Service Engineer II,,"Current Employee, more than 5 years","Life on the road, life at the shop. Okay overall.","Great job security and you can make good money up to 120k with the 78k per year base. Lots and lots of overtime.
People have told me they get good retirement packages.
Lots of industrial exposure on-site in Field Service. You will learn lots of different industries and how they work, if the end-user is nice enough to give you an explanation.
","lots of overtime means you will find it hard to have a routine in your life.
upper management sometimes makes bad administrative decisions.
company might cut your salary rate increase of 2.5% if they don't make money that year.
If you're in Field Service, then expect to work like a dog. They will utilize you 110%, including travel on weekends and possibly cancel your vacation (because who cares about your personal time).
Advice to Management

","The management is toxic - all wildly inappropriate. There was only one person on the sales team that didn't sexually harass me at one point. The management is weak and lacking support. There is no major investment for long term employment from the managers because they absorb accounts and that's all that is of importance. The pay is an abomination considering they expect you to manage current accounts, do all your own admin work, and cold call without ever receiving a lead. The atmosphere is always somewhat negative - whether it be the muster or just a day in the office. Every single thing in the office is falling apart - broken chairs, broken desks, bugs all over, dirty fridge, not even coffee. Absolutely not the job that was ""sold"" to me. The HR violations I saw here I have never been exposed to in my life, and I have always worked in bars. In the end, you'll average about $350 a week base pay.

","Managers were good at telling you what they thought you needed to hear, while making sure you were first in line at the bus stop, and not expecting the push.
Definitely not a company that supports continuous improvement, or growth by ensuring that customers are satisfied. 
Believes in supporting longer tenured employees, even if their performance is simply adequate.

2019-07-15, Solutions Analyst,Pune,"Former Employee, less than 1 year",The Worst Working Environment Company,"There's nothing good about it
","Since Toshiba has bought over Tele Dynamic, it should follow Toshiba working oriented. Unfortunately, they run like a distributor mindset aka CHINA-MAN-COMPANY. Please THINK THRICE before you want to work here as you will be given empty promises upon your reporting day. HR policy is very odd. According to Malaysian Law, every company ought to provide 13 months’ salary or bonus to employees. This is the tricky part in this company. Both are not applied. Same goes to Hospitalization and MC. Hospitalization is meant for hospital admission certificate (which none of us want to admit in) while MC is medical cert from panel clinics. HR told me in order to use hospitalization, have to apply MC first then only will grant you hospitalization. Logically thinking, hospitalization cert is hard to obtain compare to MC.
Employees here are working super silo and not willing to share knowledge. No Training provided nor guided throughout my working presence. All the answer given is busy. Obviously their time management is Bad. Working on a project, no teams are having communication yet project documentation can be done within a day yet they got praise. Frankly, I really doubt the work quality that they deliver to customer. Receptionist is gender sexism. My superior is good for nothing where he manipulate my background as I'm someone great. I'm not. Everyone learns! If you don't know what it means, please look up in Google or ask what it is. Please Do Not Deliver Wrong Messages To Peoples from All Walks of Life. It is Totally Super Unhealthy Working Environment.

2019-07-11, Software Engineer,Bangalore,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",Like Government Office,"Good Salary
good for employees who knows how to impress manager
","As the review titles, it's like a government office. Fixed 9 hours timing. Told you. government office. No work from home. They trust their employees enough to hire but not enough to give them wfh. Here appraisals and raise is not based on merit and hard work but based on how obsequious are you to your manager. Good working employees will get more and more work with no appreciation and people who do nothing but oiling their managers enjoy their life. 
Managers are equivalent to god here. You can't survive without ok sir or ok mam. 

And when employees try to leave, they bully them like nothing. They make them do enormous works working late. And taunting and inferiority laugh over you is nothing when it comes to Toshiba.

You got a project, nobody will come to help you. You will work till 9 pm or even after going home. But when you win a prize for the same, it must be shared with the whole team. 

A large part of Toshiba's population is old (>30) and many managers have been part of Toshiba for many years. (>5). This makes them bias against new talents and new methods. They dont like getting challenges and adapting new changes. It is very difficult for a real open minded talent to survive there. Because they rather choose to decide candidate on their connection and obsequious than their merit.

Internal transfers are very less, Career changing opportunities are very less. Again manager plays a big role. For any good role, he sends his favouirte and rest all can think nothing but frustation.
Advice to Management
Management is already aware of the situation but doesnt do anything. It should try to mix old and new generation. Raise and appraisal should be overseen. Yes old is gold keep it. But scatter them, dont let them have monopoly and ruin someone's life just to satisfy their ego. If you cant help your company nobody can.

","Overall: Please Please don't look at 3.6 overall rating since Toshiba has different offices in different sectors across USA. This review is specifically for Toshiba International Corporation located in Houston, TX. Please stay away if you are in your early or mid stage in your career and still care for your career progression. But this is a perfect company if you are about to retire or good at playing politics since there is no real work to do at all. Toshiba international has a wide range of products from ASD, UPS, motors and battery systems. Right now they are only living on selling battery systems and products from Japan. None of the products designed in Houston, TX are selling.

- Management: Lazy and incapable managers who are incapable of identifying tasks need to be done for a new project. Manager in key department has zero technical knowledge of their products - not even the basics of electrical and software engineering for their product, and this is leading to significant delay of their ""life saving"" new product. And manager is not aware of their structural problems due to the lack of technical knowledge and more sadly they are not willing to pay for technical training programs that the team is in urgent need for regardless what company policies are. 

- Culture: Some people here work for keeping their job safe. Some people here work for gaining more power. But nobody cares about employees and their products. Lies after lies. Engineers are commonly tired of political games and toxic atmosphere. 

Career progression - No career progression. 1. You don't learn anything since there is no work or all the work is highly repetitive because of intensive office politics. 2. Managers are incapable of leading a department in a right direction. 3. Managers don't care if you learn anything and don't promote fairly.

No work life balance.,"Flexible hours but you need to clock the mandatory work hours. For those who like OT. You can earn a lot of OT provided you like it. Seniors will coach the junior when they are new ( with scolding)
","-No work life balance due to long work hours
-Micro management
-Scolding is a widely practice
-Different departments not working as a team to deliver, company are not keen to improve on this area (deeply rooted old fashioned culture), it will only be too late when stronger external competition set-in with better cheaper products.
-High turnover
Advice to Management

2018-07-18, Engineer,"Houston, TX","Current Employee, more than 3 years",Great Place to Work!,"The average longevity of the employees at the company was 17 years. The company worked very hard to develop each employee's talents by providing an opportunity to work in various roles and departments. Management provides employees with much training to be competent in her/his role. You are surrounded with subject-matter experts in every department, so, every conversation with a co-worker is a continual learning experience.
","When the oil and gas business took a nose-dive, the company followed with multiple layoffs. The office environment is no longer buzzing with excitement, but, is filled with fear and uncertainty. When one of the outside salespeople earned more money than the President, the management changed the compensation structure and capped the salary; the same salesperson met his quota in 2 months and played golf for the remainder of the year. This was the beginning of the downfall of Toshiba.

2018-03-22, Engineer,"Ang Mo Kio New Town,","Current Employee, more than 1 year",Engineer,"Flexible working hours. Got canteen, got salary., got chair to sit on, got table . That’s all I can think of.
","If you have time to read this, then please do so.

1) Rude senior/managers- Telling your subordinates that they are stupid also does not help anything. Why not train them instead? Scolding not only decreases morale but also demotivates us.
2) Culture: Scolding is number 1 here. I tell you, if u can survive in this company for at least 2 years, ur mentality is very good and strong but it might go down as time passes by. So, leave this company while you still can. Company says want to explore other fields for business. Please focus on the company culture first before u focus on the outside. 
3) Education: I don’t think the managers here are educated to be polite since young. HR please do some background check on their primary education. I think they failed their moral subject.
4) Pay: Pay is low but not as serious as the points above.
5) Balance: I believe if this world has balance between good and bad, this company is the definition of all the bad ones.
6) Conflict: Unavoidable. Every company should have this. But a conflict in Toshiba is equivalent to nuclear war. Epic waste of time and energy.
 
Final judgment: Toshiba is a company with many years of experience in printers. While they have a lot of knowledge on this field, it will not last long considering all the points above. If you still don’t understand after reading the points above, imagine yourself drowning in the sea. No one to save you and no one to guide u. U r on ur own. Don’t come to this company. Trust me. If u don’t trust me, then trust all the reviews here before me. Most good points here only come from managers not engineers.

","Was required to edit because I guess I was too honest and discussed specific experiences of harassment and hostile work environment that the most senior manager engaged in and turned a blind eye to.

Poorly run for decades. The TAIS ""CEO"" had the Midas touch in running each and every division he managed into the ground. Each and every one...without exception. CE? Gone. Tablets? Bombed. Enterprise phones? In the toilet. Imaging? Toast. Consumer PCs? Dead. Storage? Luckily moved to another group before he killed it. Corporate PCs? Seriously on life support...no seriously. I still know people there and everyone is waiting it out for the package that may not/prob won't come. Morale is lower than when I was there and I raised my hand to leave in the last mass RIF. And I haven't even touched on the fact this person has been dating a subordinate for years and allowed her to create a hostile work environment for years. Clearly an HR violation on so many levels. HR continues to turn a blind eye. I would not work here and I hope good people get out soon. Toxic is too nice a description.

Advice to Management
Stop your whining and get bold. This division has made more money than any other inside Toshiba, and we are what is keeping the rest of the firm afloat. So stop the penny-pinching and act like the industry leader you think you are. If you really want to cut your costs, stop paying the huge golden parachutes to those who spent our cash on a failed nuclear division.

2017-08-13,Anonymous,"Houston, TX","Current Employee, more than 3 years","Political, Unprofessional, Incompetent","Pay, Benefits, 401K (6% match), time off , tuition reimbursement, parental leave. There's little else that makes this place worth staying.
","This review is specifically about Toshiba International Corporation (subsidiary) in Houston, TX, but Glassdoor won't let me select that as an option. 

First off, go to Google news and read all the issues they were having with the accounting scandal and then the embarrassment that happened with their nuclear division. Now they're forced to hack off limbs and selling their cash cow to fill the crater that the nuclear business left on their balance sheet in a company that was already posting losses and lying about it. Keep that in mind when you read the rest of this review because the mindset flows from Japan down to your CEO and supervisor.

Upper and middle management are incompetent, and the performance reviews are designed so they can keep their jobs regardless of their performance. 

They suffer from the same issue that got Toshiba Japan into financial trouble in the first place. No one wants to tell management bad news because they're afraid and upper management won't delve into the numbers to ask questions because then they can't play dumb when problems comes to light. 

The overhead is bloated due to the support groups (legal, finance, accounting) who sometime just flat out don't do their jobs or try to have say outside their authority. 
Actually, the place is full of people who flat out don't do their jobs. High performers get burned out from picking up the slack from all of the other lazy employees. 

Also be prepared to be micromanaged because what terrible company won't be complete without that aspect. 

They have no idea what market research is. They think their products are great and innovative. They're not; just overpriced garbage.

Currently looking for a new job to get out of this god awful sinking titanic of company.

The training programs for new graduates were also helpful, as it taught you the basics of Japanese business etiquette and customs. Compensation is not the highest but on the better end compared to other manufacturing companies.
","There is little to no diversity, depending on the department. There is a lot of work politics in the management level and many in upper level (i.e. key decision makers) has had little to no overseas experience, even though the company has to expand overseas. Almost half the time was spent on internal reports and processes, and in extreme cases, some people even pulled all-nighters to prepare documents to report to management.
