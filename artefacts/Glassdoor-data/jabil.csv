The turnover for the site is monthly…. They had two different Managers quit in the one year I worked there. 
They had a Covid-19 outbreak every week during my employment there. 
Jabil management traveled to the site monthly during the shutdown. They did not practice any covid protocols of social distancing or wearing a mask properly putting all at risk. 
This all points to the leadership at the top of this company. There is an old saying “ The fish rots from the head down” that is so true for this company. Stay away from JABIL!!!! It is not worth the money!!! Save your sanity and find a better place.

","Every year there are layoffs, unfortunately, they decide to let go of people who are working on projects that have huge impacts on the company creating huge issues for those left. Besides that, employees and managers who consistently cause issues stay while those who were brought on to help fix the problems created are let go due to ""budget"" or wanting to offshore their positions.

They say there are many career opportunities but they are never informed to us.

The culture is very much the old school do as I say and not as I do from the '80s, causing management to not stick up for their employees.

- It is a big company with multiple branches and market segments so it is possible to find a plethora of job opportunities
- Some 401(k) matching
- Insurance benefits are mostly on-par with local competitors
- The stock price doesn't necessarily follow the company's performance and can get to a high valuation
","- Covid-19 highlighted how little the corporate management actually cared for employees. Italy and China are two major hubs and corporate management would not proactively take measures to reduce or prevent exposure. It only did the minimum state requirements, and work from home was a very difficult battle
- Extensive lay-off culture. Every few years the workforce is reduced due to perpetual short-sighted strategy and/or massive overlapping redundancies and inefficiencies
- Working conditions vary greatly and it is especially cruel to some international counterparts. There are employees who have been forced to work while on vacation or medical leave, including taking meetings in the hospital following procedures
- Some corporate directors/VPs actually do not have any or enough working experience on roles of people they oversee
- Regional heads have incredible egos and some VPs/SVPs have dubious behavior and given their roles, have the power to enforce their ideas downstream
- If you are in the US and expecting to ever be pregnant, be ready to have no more than 6 weeks of partial leave as pregnancy is an illness/medical condition to the company
- While people are being laid off, corporate HR is having multiple events with catered meals (and so are sr. executives)
- No internal 360 feedback or ability to provide feedback on your superior
- Too many channels of parallel communication
- There are so many people doing similar jobs on certain departments that the downtime/delay with them - such as communication - while others have staff (managers or lower level) churning a lot of work, without room to breathe
Advice to Management
- Actually do stick to your laid-out strategy instead of modify everything based on very short-term stock market reaction to one quarterly call
- Do an internal assessment of corporate needs and productivity to lean out on office workers and to provide the necessary plant/supply chain resources to get things done where they matter
- 95% of Directors/VPs can be let go and cannot do the job of their ""underlings""
- Diversity & inclusion isn't having an overly caucasian population on managerial roles but instead having people of different backgrounds and ethnicities, who can provide a better and more encompassing experience to the company. A token minority hire/introduction, especially without day-to-day input, is useless

Growing company with lots of opportunity. Can work your way up from the absolute bottom of the barrel (with a little luck).

Solid overtime pay. Great overall working and manufacturing experience.
","There are many undereducated and under-qualified employees working in positions they can’t handle. 

Other skilled and experienced employees are under-appreciated or even under-utilized. 

Certain employees will be given additional responsibility outside of their job title, with no additional pay. They will take advantage of you if they see you are capable and willing to be a hybrid-type worker. 

Perceptions on people are determined early on. Lots of obvious despotism. 

No communication from HR.

2021-07-29, Engineer,"Fremont, CA","Former Employee, more than 1 year",do not work at the Fremont site,"None. They pay you in dollars and will work you if you have a pulse. They do not discriminate... there was an elderly man who uses a walker to move around the office. You do not need to know English.
","I was instructed by management to lie to the customer during meetings and falsify data. There were little to no ethics from the management. 
The turnover for the site is monthly…. They had two different Managers quit in the one year I worked there. 
They had a Covid-19 outbreak every week during my employment there. 
Jabil management traveled to the site monthly during the shutdown. They did not practice any covid protocols of social distancing or wearing a mask properly putting all at risk. 
This all points to the leadership at the top of this company. There is an old saying “ The fish rots from the head down” which is so true for this company. Stay away from JABIL!!!! It is not worth the money!!! Save your sanity and find a better place.

2021-06-26, Engineering,"Horseheads, NY",Former Employee,Destructive environment for your physical and mental health,"The people here are for the most part very friendly and easy to work with. They are the one thing that will keep you coming in each day.
","Run from this place as fast as you can if you want to spare yourself a lot of pain… figuratively and literally.

I worked at this facility for a number of years. A brief history… this plant was a Depuy Synthes / Johnson & Johnson facility until it became a Jabil plant in April 2019. The site still manufactures J&J medical implants, but the employees work for Jabil. When the company changed hands, the employee perks and benefits got significantly worse. A lot of people jumped ship. To incentivize people to stay, they came up with a plan that let people keep their J&J benefits and benefit rates, but only for 18 months, which resulted in a second wave of people quitting. The result was a mixed workforce where two people would have the same title but massive differences in their benefit costs, PTO banks, etc., simply because of when their start date was. I was a lucky one that transitioned and I felt guilty having a gifted PTO bank while my equivalents had none. They also laid off a ton of temps during COVID, so a lot of the workforce now is very green. Management gets upset when newer employees make scrap parts, but it happens all the time because the training is inadequate. 

The people here are mostly wonderful, but everything is wrong about the plant. The pay here is absolutely not competitive and they have struggled to get new employees because everyone wants to work for Corning down the road and get paid far more. Promotions are very difficult to secure and the company is completely inconsistent about how they give them (I saw amazing operators who didn’t get to the 3 level for 15+ years). Jabil Elmira has no meaningful employee recognition program and people who work unbelievably hard are not recognized. They tried creating one in the form of awarding people raffle tickets for door prizes for good work. It’s a joke and completely inadequate. I have never felt less valued as an employee in my career as when I was here.

The plant is an ergonomic nightmare with repetitive motions, unsafe body positioning, and strains everywhere. They had a nurse and an ergo engineer at one time… I watched as they both left and weren’t replaced. Management gives this issue almost no attention because they are completely focused on making money and chasing every individual piece of scrap. I developed musculoskeletal problems after 6 months here (I no longer work there and still have them) and during my first doctor visit he said “we get a lot of people from your plant”.

Do yourself a favor, spare yourself the toxic culture and the physical and mental anguish and find a better career elsewhere.
Advice to Management
Pay people a competitive rate or you'll never attract quality talent. Start a recognition program that awards cash or gift cards... many competing companies do. Promote people that work hard and stop pitting employees against each other for a limited number of promotions. Focus more on safety culture to reduce injuries.

Listen to what those who left the company are saying when there's always a vacancy in the company and departments are often short-staffed despite people are losing job everywhere else, something is very wrong with how the management treats their employee.

2021-05-25, Robotics Engineer,"Lexington, KY","Former Employee, more than 3 years",A great place to learn when there is direction,"The main project is complex so there is a lot to learn within that complexity, and there is a small enough team still to where you can feel like you make an impact.

Most people are relatively nice and willing to teach or explain.

Pays well for the area.

If you work in the office, communication is pretty good.

When there is direction for you, it can feel as if you're part of a team.
","When covid hit, it became very clear who was considered important. The pandemic was not taken seriously and some basic steps were not taken to allow for remote work. Those who chose to work remote were chastised by the (then) higher ups and comments were made when one would show up.

There were no regular meetings by team leads/management to help keep those working remote connected to the team. Opportunities for those employees would come and go without their knowledge.

I would recommend avoiding helping with any significant sustaining work as you will then essentially be considered sustaining only, more or less. If you have a personality where you want to be ""helpful"", you will need to learn to say no or you'll get taken advantage of.

There is no clear way to get promoted.

There is near explicit favoritism for people that used to work at Lexmark. These people do have the most experience with the robot, but gaining experience doesn't seem to be recognized, essentially making joining the ""circle"" impossible.

There is workaholic attitude from some of the more esteemed individuals, while others are starved for interesting work, or do work that's inconsequential.

A lot of this didn't seem to be the case before the main project was relatively stable in the field, but over time, as more people came on, people that helped with field work got passed up by new hires and essentially left to do menial work.
Advice to Management
You may have started already, but please have weekly team meetings even if they seem like a waste of time. Meet individually with people at least once every 2 weeks. Ask what people want to work on. Don't protect the ""inner circle"" individuals from sustaining tasks. If they're truly the ones that must be working on it, then maybe cross-training is needed whether they want it or not.

Break the favoritism. Feeling 2nd class for years is not what you want for employees that you somehow expect to retain.

Machines and Equipment on their last legs with no previous forethought of downed and misfunctioning resources. They actually wait until something is totally dysfunctional before deciding to replace or fix it without listening to the great people they do have to tend to technical issues.

","Lots of Reduction in Forces 
The same group of employees are promoted year after year and everyone else is pushed aside and it’s obvious 
Easy to fall into the background and not be noticed nor recognized for your hard work 
Employees are led to believe there are merit increases and bonus payouts, there have not been any the past 2 years and this has placed a huge financial burden on families.
All Employees are placed in a specific bracket of a pay range for cost saving purposes vs. being compensated for their experience and skill level 
Promotion process is unfair and unethical 
If you do not have good exposure to the leadership team, you will not be given the opportunity for challenging work, your work will go unnoticed and your career will digress after a few years. 
Managers are drowning in the same work as their employees and it’s impossible for them to be an effective people manager and provide support to their teams 
Increasing company revenue but more and more people are being Let go - why? 
This company loses the best talent because they go unnoticed and are not engaged - the culture needs to change and it’s an on fire issue at this point. Jabil’s reputation is one the line as being a good workplace.
It is truly sad to see what has become of Jabil over the past couple of years, the Leadership and executive team has become very self Involved and fail to notice or even care about how the employees are being treated. 
This work place has become stifling and lacks transparency

Start leading with integrity and do the right thing. Recognize and Promote the Right People, place the right people in the right jobs.

","A contract manufacturing company that sees their employees as disposable . Little concern for Quality or their employees in order to meet their unrealistic numbers. Hard to backfill or retain the amount employees that are leaving that it’s resulting in 25-30% of resources doing 100% of the previous expected responsibilities. Not competitive in compensation in the medical device market making it difficult to get competent managers/leaders. Expectations of 60 hours work weeks for EVERYONE. Unfortunately this company feels rotten to the core and this is highly felt by the employees at the lower levels.

Most Sr Leadership is white and is the true definition of ""the good ol boys club"". There are some white women that have broken that glass ceiling but it almost seems that Jabil is checking the box with those women. If you are a person of color ask them of their D&I mission statement and look around to see if that is what you see. Look at who is in the D&I organization.

","Unless you're being parachuted into the company and started off on a high note, career progression is almost non-existent. The unspoken rule - compensation is based on the number of years experience rather than achievements. If you're looking for a stable lifetime employment, start low and stay forever. 

HR is biased towards management's decision and do not always act in the best interest of their employees. Policies and team structures are constantly changing (every few months) and there is a lack of a proper communication channel on these changes. Management team is expat-heavy with few locals.
Advice to Management
Please plan ahead. Frequent short-term changes to team structure and policies is both time-consuming and cost-ineffective. Rather than spending money on severance package, the business may be better off if a better fit/ someone who is suitable for the long-term outlook of the company is hired instead.

2020-05-25, Engineer,"Fremont, CA","Former Employee, more than 1 year",Stay away from Jabil Fremont,"If you are a relative of a person working in an upper management or who has a hold of, you will be treated well and get quick promotions, and if not, I would suggest looking for other companies.
Benefits are okayish (much lesser than many other companies around in the bay area) because you'd be enrolled in the Jabil payroll.
","I worked at Jabil Fremont for almost a year.
The entire company was an earlier mom & pop shop which became something big and was bought by Jabil. Most of the ""True Tech"" employees (earlier name of the company) even after 1 year of the merger are still the same and the culture has not changed even a bit. Each employee is a relative of one or the other person which would be on higher positions. Being said this, if something goes wrong, each relative would stand for someone else and the person not having any contact would be the scapegoat. Complaints, even if heard by any personnel or HR, would just see the trash bin and nothing would happen except the complainer's name would be out and everyone would know, who complained about whom which might turn out to be very bad. 
The company management tends to micro-manage each second (at least in the team I was a part of). My manager would treat his team as more like slaves rather than respecting respective engineers and his subordinates. Upper management thinks as if they are the owners of the company and can do any and everything. Hardly you would get any credits for any good work, because management would take that and you would be bashed even for the work you are not responsible for, if things go bad (specially if you are newcomer and you don't have connections).
[Additional points:- I was asked on the day of orientation 1st day of my work as why did I decide to join this terrible company and if I had some other options, then to choose that.... should have listened to him :( ]

This being said, there are few handful employees which are very good and supportive which would guide you and help for your growth and betterment. If you are in that team, you are lucky.
Advice to Management
Try to get rid of the older management who thinks they are the owners, try to get new personnel (specially not all who have one or the other connections/relative bonding internally). Hire good leaders rather than the bosses who do not guide but just delegate each and every work while they sleep sometimes.
HR team is terrible and would talk to their 'relatives' about some complaints of one personnel which should be confidential. They would not even try to understand the concerns but would create more problems for the employees. Maybe look for some non-connected HR personnel at a hire position who has some power.
Not even sure if Jabil (HQ) knows about any of these issues and if they know, it didn't seem like they were doing anything about this, maybe look into this.

2020-05-13, Engineer,"Saint Petersburg Beach, FL","Current Employee, more than 3 years",Explore all options thoroughly before landing here!,"Diversity of projects without building expertise in a single domain (if that is desired).
","Management - The St. Petersburg healthcare design group is run under a mob mentality with zero transparency and accountability for unilateral actions taken by the site director and the supporting managers without balancing employee concerns and fears. During project bids for instance, estimates on scope and labor from experienced senior engineers are ignored in favor of underbidding quotes and winning projects. This detrimental practice catches up very quickly as it is realized during successive engineering phases from engineering design test (EDT), engineering verification test (EVT) and design verification test (DVT) that there was a gross misalignment in the original quotations which is misaligned with the customers' expectations. This results in issuance of contract change orders at repeated intervals to the consternation of the customers. And although senior engineers feel vindicated when this happens, they are left overwhelmed with the ""I told you so"" syndrome. 
Lack of Career Opportunities - Overall, there is lack of youth, women and minorities in the design center with these scarcities exacerbated particularly at management levels. Contractors are also predominantly older (>50 years) white men who are brought in mainly on the basis of their years of work experience regardless of how relevant that work is to the given project’s resourcing needs. A further downside of this practice is that junior engineers are almost never given more responsibilities thereby enabling them to successively prove they are eventually promotion worthy. To this end, the lack of promotions even for the most senior engineering staff based on exemplary performance reviews are held back and blamed on HR and other bureaucratic factors by the management. The company executive officers including the CEOs of Jabil Inc. and Jabil Healthcare keep touting the role of women and its importance within the company. However, the hiring practices run counter to these lip services, as within the engineering staff, women are not sought out or hired for roles in systems, electromechanical or software functions. 
Lack of Transparency - This is especially evident when it comes to how bonuses are given out. Employees are provided only with a rough sketch of their annual performance evaluations and told that they will receive a writeup informing them of their annual bonus payout. A couple of months go by and this writeup is not received. Eventually a payout is made; however, management or HR will not bother to explain the breakdown of the payout with respect to the management-based objective (or MBO) targets for the fiscal year. HR overall is absent from interactions with employees when it comes to face time or even generic email communications with respect to employee's growth, development or understanding of ongoing concerns with respect to management. Many of us still do not know who our group's HR representative is. 
Facility - The healthcare group was moved to the single-story Jabil Innovation Center (JIC) about a year ago. The facility was already overfilled and employs an open layout devoid of cubicles which is extremely disruptive to performing quiet and cohesive deep analytical work. Further, this facility is not equipped with security staff and front desk greeting staff thereby heightening security and medical risks for several employees. Parking is extremely limited with people having to park off site during customer visits which are more frequent lately. 
The above inconveniences along with healthcare management's abuse of power and continuous disregard for transparency in many work facets have led to significant declines in employee welfare and morale.
Advice to Management
My advice to the executive management is to not overlook the abuses of power that are currently undertaken at lower management levels within the company in the face of the higher than normal share values (which are on the decline at present owing to the coronavirus pandemic). 
Scrutinize the practices of this St. Petersburg healthcare design center, particularly the behavior of the site director and his supporting staff when it comes to bidding on projects, appropriately utilizing engineering resources, hiring practices, discrimination against women, holding back promotions and ignoring security, safety and working environment concerns of current employees. Further, get HR involved by taking an interest in the development of engineering staff members to enable fair growth and upward mobility in senior management positions. HR should be a resource available to all and not just those titled Directors or Senior Directors and above.

Just because the PM has a ""good image"" to higher management doesn't mean the PM is qualified.

Majority of all rates are originated from a cubicle with no hands on realistic experience. The biggest would be the company stresses employee input and contribution emphasizing a progressive and open minded platform, yet once You reach the floor it is a completely different world and about numbers rather than quality.

Anyone seeking self achievement and pride in what they do should not have much expectations here.

2020-01-25, Commissioning Manager,"New York, NY",Former Employee,"Laid back, good environment, cool people","Easy, simple job Good pay, almost everyone is nice and friendly. Either do 12 hour shifts being a sorter or 8 hour shifts on assembly line. Bonus overtime after 40 hours, maybe some double pay on Sundays.
","4 o clock to 4 o clock. Can be REALLY slow at times, some days we basically got paid to stand for 12 hours. That's probably not a ""Con"". Rotating shift, 4 days a week then 3 days a week. Have to wear a special lab coat kind of thing, gloves, protective eye wear, composite toe shoes with straps (straps were the most annoying thing about the job) you have to step on scale that tells you if you pass or fail every time you enter the work area.
Advice to Management
I actually liked the job but I got put in an awkward situation. You must fire the angry people. No need for that kind of energy in such a wonderful facility.

","It’s a sweat shop with management at the plant level that has absolutely no clue. Their is no respect or integrity among the management team. Strong-arming and intimidation tactics are how pretty much everything is managed. Want something done? Yell louder and use more profanity than anyone else in the room. 

If you’re planning on attending their job fair on 1/18, I would highly recommend forgetting about it..unless you enjoy being treated like garbage and working for more hours and for less money than most other manufacturing jobs in the greater Tampa Bay Area.

(4% vs, 8-10% at good companies) Salaries are well below national average. Some managers brag at the low salaries they pay their engineers. To add insult, they will require you to work many hours one year and lay you off the next year without regard to the time you have dedicated to the company. There is no job security at this company. The good ol boy network is alive and well. I feel sorry for the women who work there, the good looking ones are those that receive promotion, regardless of talent, If you are talented and middle aged, not so much.

","Very disappointed with quality of management that it is well below the standard in terms of dedication, responsibility, team player and lack of immersion in the problems as engineers. Once promoted to manager or more, they are no longer engineers but Gods that just ask for things to be done and the ""I don't want to hear it, I want it done"" is the best they can do. The pressure put by managers gives a false feeling that things are hot, but in fact is a bicycle with broken chain.
HR is also another place that do not help, advice or get involved when required. In fact, HR is the only department with La Dolce Vita life, with ALL THEIR STAFF barely working 7-8 hours including lunch, a department aside of the rest of company in terms of abiding to the rules. They have practically no input in selecting and fighting for people that have the experience and education when filling a posted position.

- Free donuts on Friday in the office, but those are provided by a vendor, not Jabil.
- On site gym.
","-Pay is low compared to similar jobs at most other companies, and Jabil doesn't have a particularly glamorous working environment to make up for it.
- Constrained market conditions for buyers.
- Conflicting advice, lack of support, and poor communication from management
- Poor training. In addition, many of my coworkers were criticized for something they had done before they received training (on a new program, or procedure for example) 
- Many long-term employees that had worked there for a while were clearly angry individuals.
- Long working hours are often required to play catch up. 
- Opinions and politics matter more than actual statistical and mathematical inferences. 
- This place will break you down. With many people I worked with, I saw a change in their eyes and happiness after starting to work there.

","Management at our facility is too young and have no people skills, They are condescending and won't allow you to use the restroom or get a drink when needed. It's ""work work work""! Breaks are at a minimum, with a 10 minute break in reality becoming a 4 minute break, once you've waited in line to cleared the checkpoint to leave the assembly floor, because the entire warehouse is given their break all at the same time! No water to drink on the assembly floor! You have to wait for someone to come and stand in your place in line so you can get a drink in the hot environment. Manager literally told me that Jabil only wants young people working there, because of their stamina. I'm 55 and am treated very poorly. I am often left to stand ALONE and wait for my assignment while everyone else has been given theirs and has gotten to work. It is very humiliating the way I and another older gentleman are being treated. I have complained twice to my hiring manager at the staffing agency but she seems inept in being able to offer a solution.
Advice to Management
Get people to manage your business that have a verifiable management background, and not some twenty-something wanna-be who you hired to work the line! Give us decent break times! Give us water, for crying out loud! Your managers need to be people-friendly!

So if you're not a person who is easily overwhelmed, you'll do great. Although the company has 200k employees worldwide, it still has a small business feel within the corporate environment. The work environment is flexible, the work itself and what the company does is incredibly interesting, and the people are stellar. You also get about two weeks off at the end of December, when the company shuts down.
","The benefits aren't much to look at. Although the company shuts down the last two weeks of December, most of it is deducted from your PTO. Along those lines, you only get 15 days of PTO (after first year) and 1 floating holiday. Health insurance is OK.

","- Leadership vaccum in Managerial and VP level with no vision on what they want to do or where they want to go.
- Do not listen to new ideas from employees nor the leadership team provides any ideas to employees. It is a circle where nothing tangible comes out and employees feel lost with this culture. No ideas.
- Long term employees who have grown to leadership levels are too comfortable and egos fly high. Sharing ideas openly or showing leadership can be problematic as they can come back at you badly because of insecurity. This was a big cultural surprise.
- No guidance on how to navigate the structure and be successful. Seems there are too many clicks within the org and they seems to cover for each others with the only goal of saving their own jobs and pleasing their bosses.. How will the firm grow otherwise ?
Advice to Management
Enough advice given. Executives, it high time. Go and listen to your employees and help them be successful by resolving their issues. Just making strategy videos will not help you understand the internal issues. Spend some time with each organization. We really want you to be successful and hence the feedback. Please act by reorganizing your senior leaders, Directors, BUD's, VP's etc . Make them listen and act outside their egos. Stop the blame game acts now.

Develop a formal code of conduct that educates staff on the negative effects of bullying on an individual and group’s morale and on the organization’s survival.

Medical benefits are good. No micromanaging; Schedule is pretty flexible. The pay is decent.

","Not trained properly. No one cared enough to even help you and management within your wing was condescending if you didn’t do something right (but you were never told the correct way to do it). My first night I was left alone with numerous machines and no clue what I was doing. I didn’t even know where the guy who trained me was half the time. You also have to wear steel toe boots. And since you work with medical pieces you have to wear gloves, a hair net, a lab coat, and shoe covers. During all your breaks you have to remove and put these items back on. It’s also extremely hot with all those things on. And 12 hour shifts in steel toe boots are a nightmare.

2018-02-02,Anonymous,"Saint Petersburg, FL","Current Employee, more than 10 years",Going the Wrong Way for a Long Time,"Not many these days. Most of the non-management employees are hard-working, honest, dependable people. Management-not so much.
","Exempt employees are expected to work 10-12 hour days and most weekends. Hourly employees are jerked around constantly on hours, told one week they can't have overtime, then demanded to work a 60-hour week the next. Morale is the lowest I've seen in several years. The division is terribly understaffed and management has become lazy and clueless over the last decade. Most managers either do not know or do not care if the business that they bring in is within the capability of the current staff to produce, and core competencies like IPC-A-610 soldering requirements are not trained effectively enough to prevent passing non-complient product to the end customers at a consistent and alarming rate. Training is nearly non-existent and supervisory personnel are not knowledgable enough to fill the void of only having one trainer in the plant.
Advice to Management
Management need to abandon the pseudo-military management structure and start listening those you would currently call the ""enlisted folks"". There are serious problems on the production floor that are being ignored and are ongoing and causing serious damage to the company reputation. The old management moto of ""employee empowerment"" has become a punch line to a joke told frequently at the water cooler. This division of Jabil used to be among the best in the world, but that is no longer the case and has not been for the last 6-8 years, and the buck stops with the management team.

Management are only interested in short term cost cutting. They just want the cheapest option and will make you redundant if you become too expensive.

They can set teams up to fail with unrealistic goals and deadlines just to replace teams with what they really want. Or they can remove key stakeholders so that the project folds in on itself.
Advice to Management
Don't treat remote employees like they're second class. Include them in the decision making process and communications that affect them.

Remember that your employees are people and not just numbers in a spreadsheet that can be replaced with cheaper numbers.

When redundancies or restructuring happens don't leave people in the dark about the future of their employment. One minute they'll tell you you're fine, then the next half your team is gone.

Have open and honest communication.

2017-08-16, Applications Engineer,"Anaheim, CA","Former Employee, less than 1 year",Didn't think it got this bad in the US,"Medical and dental benefits continue for 3 years after you quit on a Friday
","Managers were unbelievably bad. I don't intimidate easily, and I quit after 4 months because I felt intimidated. 

Was hired as an engineer and was only ever given manual labor to do. The big boss saw me checking the time on my phone and called me in for review on my first day. Had to furnish my own tools for this job, to do the manual labor, I did 12 hours a day, as an engineer... so bad it's confusing... Shop was horribly disorganized, and managers made us pretend to build robots for made-up customers when corporate came around. When I was actually being productive, bad project management meant that a job I was told to finish in 2 weeks would take 4 or 6 despite 12 hour days + Saturday. I'd complete a work-cell in a week and a manager would come tear it down to work on ""software"" or something while I was working on something else. Then I'd get in trouble. All the while the boss would talk about Steve Jobs and how hard he worked. 

Unsafe working conditions like lifting you up 30 feet on a forklift with no harness to pull down heavy equipment so we could pretend to build robots for fake customers. I nearly died. 

 This place is the most ridiculously unprofessional employer I've ever had in 15 years working full time. Randomly received a paycheck 6 months after quitting, for like $100 or something. Still receiving medical, dental, vision, and retirement benefits 3 years after quitting, in spite of several calls and emails to HR. I suspect they never took me off the books.

Lots of favoritism within departments with directors not held accountable for solid training plan after hiring.
Advice to Management
New orientation is a crucial time for employees and should be taken seriously. Onboarding and developing is the next step after hiring and one of the most important cycles that are missed here.
Learn to listen better so as to improve communication internally as this should be a consistent process every year. Leadership needs to share more and be visible to employees as new changes always seem to come as a surprise. Work seriously on your expat process as 50% either fail, quit or term upon return . The numbers don't lie and should be a wake up call to not only HR but also hiring managers.

Repor","New orientation is a crucial time for employees and should be taken seriously. Onboarding and developing is the next step after hiring and one of the most important cycles that are missed here.
Learn to listen better so as to improve communication internally as this should be a consistent process every year. Leadership needs to share more and be visible to employees as new changes always seem to come as a surprise. Work seriously on your expat process as 50% either fail, quit or term upon return . The numbers don't lie and should be a wake up call to not only HR but also hiring managers.

","Company is highly critical of productivity through metrics and continuous improvement, to the degree its oppressive to the employees. Promotion opportunities have all but vanished unless you are pre-selected for a certain position. I've seen less experienced under grads get positions ahead of senior employees with adequate experience to promote. Very discouraging and a huge reason I am no longer employed there (after 23 years). This is the ""good ol boy"" network others refer to. HR is resilient to employee issues. The company in its early years was expanding, super profitable and a acquisition tyrant. A good place to be. Not so much these days as the economy has cooled.

There is very little micromanagement and management will defend the decisions made by their underlings.

 If you are good at your job and are willing to work hard and adapt, your job will be very secure and management will do whatever they have to do to keep you.
","Lack of formal training. Most of the training you receive will be from shadowing other employees and their is no formal training for most positions. 

Very fast paced and things can change VERY quickly so if you cannot adapt on the fly you probably won't enjoy the job. 

Being a contract manufacturer the company structure changes as new customers come in and old customers leave so large layoffs followed by mass hirings are fairly common.

Much better options in the Bay Area,"- You can find dedicated people here, who are intelligent, competent, and will work late and on weekends to get the job done. You can find them at every level, from the assembly line worker to the VP levels.
- Jabil is a very data driven company. To influence decision makers, you must have a firm grasp on the numbers, and the underlying concepts that drive them.
- Jabil is not afraid to try new things, and is making strides to be an innovator in its sector.
","- The ethics of this company are low. Lying to customers and partners is almost built into the company's guidelines.
- There is a pervasive culture of sexism and sexual harassment. I have witnessed it on several occasions, and feel ashamed I did not speak up about it.
- There is a pervasive culture of racism. For instance, I have heard the n-word on several occasions with no shame; feel ashamed I did not speak up. There are clear advancement ceilings for various groups. 
- Despite the data-driven nature of the company, there is an ironic anti-intellectualism there. In Silicon Valley, no less, one of my managers told me noone cared about my graduate degrees . Fortunately, for most companies in the Valley, having higher education is considered a credit to the firm.

You'll get to 'play hard' at company parties (ie, get drunk) and they'll send you home in a company-paid taxi. When times get tough, they will lay off ... even if you have consistently high performance reviews. More than 400 laid off in September 2015, mostly women.
