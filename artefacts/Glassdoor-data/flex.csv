2021-09-24, Process Engineering Manager,"Memphis, TN","Former Employee, more than 5 years","A Stepping Stone at Best, a Grave Stone at Worst","The pay is not bad and there is a lot to do, which should translate to a lot of experience and potential opportunities down the road, in theory.
","You want stress? They got stress. 

You want work life balance? I wish you luck. 

TL;DR Flex has a terrible culture and work environment.

In Memphis they do 3rd party logistics (3PL). That means doing contract work for Flex to provide services for big name brands at rock bottom prices. Upper management underbids contracts to win them and then overworks everyone to try to fulfill them. 10-20% of the people do about 80-90% of the work. 

Middle management's main job is to make excuses to customers and upper management for why Flex can't deliver at the level they agreed to in the first place. SPOILER: It's because upper management agreed to deliver Ferrari results on a Fiat budget, but saying that out loud is just a different way of saying ""I wish to resign my position effective immediately."" So no one does. Everyone is in it for the money and everyone in middle and upper management is exclusively in it for themselves. 

The half-life for management is 6 months to a year.

Flex will never change this business model and that is why these contracts and the Memphis site are doomed to failure or perpetual struggle. Flex closed all of their other service sites across the country. Memphis is the last one, and it is always hanging on by a thread. There is one main account keeping that site alive, and that account has been on life support for like 20 years. They are almost always talking about pulling the plug. If you know, you know. 

Flex and its customers have no problem working anyone to death if you let them. Their pandemic response is proof of that. They made people they could have easily let continue to work from home come back in way too soon and a lot of people got COVID-19 that did not have to as a direct result of that. As usual, Flex lied about it and claimed no one got COVID-19 inside the building, but of course they would say that. The State of Tennessee passed liability protections designed to protect businesses from COVID-19 lawsuits in the Summer of 2020 right after Flex Memphis made everyone come back on site. They do not care if you die because they can't even be sued if their negligence gets you killed by COVID-19 thanks to Tennessee's crooked government. 

Outside of IT, it is not a good idea to try to stay there long term. Doing so could literally destroy your life. IT does pretty well, but the overall environment is not the best in part because everyone hates their job since it is impossible to meet the demands with any consistency, and in part because their senior leadership is hired and retained based entirely on their willingness and ability to ignore reality, smile, and lie through their teeth about anything and everything.

","Too much of non value adding work (documentation) is done in GBS because of which the actual work gets ignored sometimes, that too its not actually used later

","Not reliable, our senior manager was fired without giving any reason, my friends were fired during layoff. we have not received any hike for 2 years. TL uses this increment cycle as opportunity to take out personal revenge. I had dispute with TL several time because he was wrong. 
He did not gave me even half of the hike other got.
I over worked everyday extended 2 hrs more than what I was paid. Everything in vein.

Business Outlook
Pros
- Financially stable and growing company, great list of clientele
- Core business is based on innovation (not IT though)
- Work life balance is manageable
- HR team is supportive, which reflected during the covid period
- Helpful and effective measures were taken during covid to protect employees
Cons
- Diversity, culture & values are only on paper (& promotional videos)
- Completely decentralised approach to management
- Global policies are restricted to those who publish them, so teams work in silos as per their own wish
- Your experience will vary based on your reporting manager's conduct
- Incompetent bootlickers are favoured and praised in some teams
- Excessive meeting culture; Solution for every problem or project work is to just schedule unnecessary 2-4hr calls every day for months
- Pay is below industry standard
- Weightage of variable component (they call it Bonus!) in salary is a way to take advantage of employees
- Three months of notice period for entry level roles is not justified

Pay is okay.
PTO is decent, 15 days & 10 holidays.
Overall, a friendly workforce.
","Work-Life balance is a huge problem. Engineers are often moved between new projects, which contain VERY aggressive 'ramp-up' schedules to build & qualify a line to produce sellable product. These periods last for months and regularly 10-12 hour days & working weekends. 

Upper management makes the decisions/schedules, yet know nothing about the practicality or work involved. They don't listen to their staff.
Advice to Management
Respect your employees' time. It shouldn't be an expectation for engineers to work 50% of Saturdays in a ramp up. This should be a rarity at only the most critical deadlines. We have families & a life outside Flex. This lack of respect drives employees to seek work elsewhere.

at the site level, but no further.
","Culture is toxic at the hourly employee level. Management is often not in tune with the clients' expectations. Corporate cleans house often, breaking institutional memory, resulting in making the same mistakes repeatedly.

Management downplayed health hazards associated with COVID-19, even as employees visibly called in sick. Management also challenged high risk employees' doctor recommendations to quarantine.

Outside of COVID-19, front line employees are brought in as temps, with zero commitments to hire permanently. These employees are considered contractors and are often subjected to termination on a whim.
Advice to Management
Executives: stop changing local management in Memphis. Repair operations are loss leaders and rarely make profit. That is to be expected, especially when bundled with profitable forward logistics accounts.

2021-03-15, Computer Repair Technician,"Memphis, TN",Current Employee,Be prepared for overtime,"If you need the money, it’s a great place to work temporarily. The company sometimes will buy lunch or donuts to show their appreciation for employees.
","Overtime is mandatory if there’s work to be done. They say it’s optional and in training that the work week can’t exceed 48 hours, but if you don’t show up on the day you’re scheduled even if it puts you in overtime, you’ll be reprimanded. Some weeks they don’t let you work more than 40 hours, and they’ll send you home at lunch on Wednesday so you can work a full 10 hour day on Saturday and stay below 40. Hours for repair techs are 6a-5p. I started with a group scheduled Mon-Fri, and then they switched everyone to Tues-Sat. Anyone who couldn’t make the schedule switch was simply let go.
Advice to Management
Having consistency in the schedule would make it a lot easier to work there. If overtime wasn’t mandatory, that would also be nice.

Though I have an A+ certification, their hiring process will basically bring anyone on as a temp. I have seen people come in that didn't know the first thing about computers get jobs, but their success varies. Good pay, and they have overtime almost every week since covid started
","At the moment they require 10 hours for five days a week every week, and you can't really expect less even if they call it temporary. With that said, when you sign on for a schedule, don't expect it to stay constant. I have seen many situations where they blame individual techs for mistakes instead of the system they are running, such as part supply being down and blaming techs for not finishing repairs fast enough.
Advice to Management
Find better ways to hire quality technicians instead of hiring anyone that comes in with a pulse. Pretty sure hiring supervisors fill out the questionnaires for people most of the time, which leads to poor performance on the floor. Communication with contracted employees needs to be more transparent with where their contract is in the roll-over process. Stronger training programs that focus more on troubleshooting than warranty codes.

""We are sending her to another leadership seminar.""
Advice to Management
Treat your employees with respect and pay them what they're worth. Long term employees with experience are worth SO much more than an ever revolving door of new employees. And keep that in mind when you're dishing out a slice of the pie. Why should senior employees with experience and families and house payments make less than kids straight out of high school???

As a proactive, those envious TLs and Assistant Managers behave very cheap by means of informing to HRs without giving opportunities to the employees to improve and creating issues against them. Worst Team is that Finance Best (worst) Practice- Costing Team.
Advice to Management
To the HRs: Don't blindly trust the words of Managers just because they are managers. Imagine if you were not involving in a murder but a person says you only committed the murder. The same thing is what Management is always doing against employees. Do you think low level employees are always committing mistakes or do you think top management is always correct? Then you are all Fools by not using your brains Or if you HRs are purposefully bowing your heads against injustices of managers just because they are managers then you HRs are typically slaves for managers foot. Don't be silly/ cheap. Do analyze what is the truth Not the designation and sweet lies.

2020-09-23, Process Engineering Manager,"Memphis, TN","Former Employee, more than 8 years","Highly abusive, brutally exploitative, toxic culture, terrible leadership, and poor benefits. Some opportunity to learn.","Money is literally the only pro - they pay just enough to make leaving a difficult decision, aka ""golden handcuffs"", but after about a year or two at most, you will likely realize that this is not a healthy or sustainable work environment for salaried employees, and hourly employees are overworked and under-payed based on the unreasonable expectations and performance targets they are expected to hit in order to support the under-performers who are just there to chit-chat and get a paycheck for doing next to nothing. Despite that, hourly employment is not completely out of the question as the work is not too complicated, just grueling and stressful due to poor leadership at the upper management level. Mid-level management burnout is measured in months if not weeks, but if you remain highly engaged and manage to survive, you will gain a ton of skills and experience very quickly which you can use to enhance your resume and springboard to your next job. Another pro is that when you are ultimately forced to leave Flex because of how toxic it is, you will feel much better and your next job will feel like a picnic even if the working conditions are mediocre at best.
","Management all the way up to the executive level under-bids contracts and then offers little to no support to their business teams, often sabotaging efforts to improve by under-staffing, maintaining high turnover rates, and changing gears constantly during key projects causing repeated failures to deliver on time or to the quality or degree expected by the customer. Management constantly burns out high performers by rewarding low performers (favoritism and ""keeping the noise level down"") because they receive a lot of ethics and EEOC complaints. As a result, turnover at all levels really is ridiculous. Those low performers who are allowed to stay because of the site's fear that they will file complaints continue to sabotage their peers and supervisors with their inadequate performance, unapproved moonlighting, policy abuses, etc. 

Anyone who is highly capable generally leaves as soon as they can because they recognize a doomed enterprise when they see one. The customers, especially big industry giants, are extremely abusive and toxic. Management and HR not only allow this mistreatment of their employees, but they encourage and exacerbate it by conforming their culture to the attitude of the customer and standing by the old adage ""the customer is always right"" even if the customer belittles, insults, curses at, and generally abuses employees directly. Management even allows customers to call employees directly, assign work directly to employees, and allows customers to determine who is allowed to work on their accounts, allowing them to essentially fire or reassign employees as the customer sees fit about 90% of the time. The business model in their services sector, which is what Memphis does, is completely unsustainable, because Flex leadership intentionally ignores engineering studies and under-bids to win contracts. As a result, they are unable to fulfill the SLA. This consistently unsustainable approach results in a drastic lack of resources which results in the high-pressure, high stress situation of everyone being required to perform multiple jobs and work unsustainable hours. This has also resulted in every single service site in the United States EXCEPT Memphis being closed within the last couple of years, and Memphis is struggling to keep their head above water due to lack of business. 

Everyone is pushed not only out of their comfort zone, but often past the breaking point at almost all levels. Even prior to COVID-19, many employees would go on medical leave due to health conditions related to an unhealthy and impossibly demanding workload which leaves no room for self care or any quality of life outside of work. During the pandemic, the company at first promised full transparency, but as the number of cases in the greater Memphis area and the site continued to rise, HR and management became much less communicative about the number of confirmed cases at the site. They have taken some steps to address the pandemic, but they refuse to follow health department guidelines. People work and eat way too close to each other, people walk around with their masks under their noses, gloves are optional and thousands of pieces of shared equipment pass from naked hand to naked hand on a daily basis. Outside of COVID-19, chronic illness and substance abuse is rampant at all levels. I know multiple former and current employees from upper management all the way down to hourly production workers who have been hospitalized after suffering a psychological break directly caused by work-related stress or severe and prolonged substance abuse (self medication). Many workers feel like they have to be drunk or high either on or off the job to continue to work there long term. A disturbing number of people come to work smelling like weed and alcohol from hourly employees all the way up to management. 

Unless you are a ruthless, cunning, deluded, and narcissistic sociopath, there is no career for you at Flex Memphis. Hard work and high performance are not rewarded anywhere near as much as gaming the system and/or playing politics. This job ruined my health, and almost ruined my marriage. I tried to stick it out for way too long because so many of my coworkers and employees begged for me to stay and I needed the money at the time, but leaving was one of the best decisions I have ever made in my entire life. I still get messages from former employees and coworkers saying they wish I had stayed, but there is no way I would ever go back to that hellish place. Stay away unless you literally cannot find any other job, in which case, you should be prepared to get in, get some experience, and get out ASAP.
Advice to Management
I won't even address management directly because they either cannot or will not change for the better. They simply do not care about their employees outside of how brutally they can exploit them. Buying people pizza once a month does not excuse working people more than 60 hours a week for months or even years on end, destroying their family lives, harming their relationships inside and outside of work, refusing to offer hazard pay or adequately protect employees per local health department guidelines during a global pandemic, etc. Also, they will probably all be replaced pretty soon if the site does not close, since the turnover is so high and the site is the last in a failing sector of Flex's overall business strategy, so it doesn't matter what advise anyone gives. This place will chew you up and spit you out like used bubble gum and is ultimately doomed to fail. If the site is still operating in 3-5 years I will be surprised. They lose accounts and money like a sieve due to shear incompetence, and then pat themselves on the back as they pass the buck down to the lower level managers and supervisors which they fail to support as they ruthlessly exploit them and everyone else.

2020-09-06, Computer Repair Technician,"Memphis, TN","Former Employee, more than 3 years",A lot of promoting to individuals who are not qualified,"Money 
Overtime 
Time off
Great culture ( but only amongst other techs not management I feel bad for them)
","No room to grow
they lie about promotions and raises 
changing the schematics so u cant get a raise
changing schedules without notice 
stop pitting the temps against the direct hires its a horrible thing to do 
actually ""TRAIN"" the new hires , its a bunch of techs on that floor who have no idea of the process, safety, etc 
security is extremely unqualified ( learn some sensitivity training)
Advice to Management
Just hire actual managers and not techs whove been there for years to be ""managers""
Stop lying to the people that make you money on the production floor and maybe youd have no turn over rate at all
stop allowing gossiping, bullying. etc, 
actual care about the employees who have been there for years but are still in the same position at the same pay rate 
There are knowledgable techs that have quit due to the amount of unfairness shown at the MEMPHIS FACILITY

","Flex has been around since 1969 and a number of people have been there for several years. In my experience, these old timers were not always familiar with new developments in their field and they were not always open to new people with new ideas. Lots of new people do not last long. At Flex, it is more important to be liked than to be knowledgeable or talented. Also, they have great diversity in terms of nationality. But is still a very White male dominated culture despite the new female CE0.

-Fast-moving, fulfilling work that changes constantly
-Ethical company that treats workers fairly
-Diverse workforce - get to work with people of different ages, skills and backgrounds from around the world

-Promotions are merit-based and high performers can move up quickly

If money is the most important factor for you, Flex probably isn't the right place, but if you want to leave before sunset most days, I think Flex is a great place to work. Almost everyone I work with is bright, hard-working and could make more money somewhere else, but choose Flex so they can spend more time with their families.
","Contract manufacturing is a brutal business and meager profits mean the company can't offer the same frills as other Bay Area tech companies. Also, fluctuations in demand make the business prone to layoffs.

-Average benefits package and time off 
-Limited or no employee stock options
-Salaries are low to average
-Maternity benefits are barely better than what is required by law
-Working with HR can be frustrating since the HR team is fragmented. Interviewing and negotiating my offer was a poor experience, but I don't think these negative interactions are indicative of the rest of the company.
Advice to Management
Better maternity benefits would help retain more women, but I'm sure they're working on it. Overall management does a great job considering they are in such a tough field.

Listen to your employees because you have a lot of unhappy people working at your Buffalo Grove site. I was excited to work at Flex in the beginning and then it all went downhill. All I heard was negative things about the site I was in and how many employees either left or were looking for new jobs. My boss not even happy and he could not even hide it. The vibe was so depressing and negative that I had to leave. I am so thankful that I left when I did. I worked with a good team but not at the right company.

Have Aerotek and the other contract workers stop handing out cheat sheets on computer components to get new hires to sneak past the interview and you may be able to hire competent technicians. Also, whoever agreed to take on the jobsite at Louisville, KN workload is/was a complete imbecile for trying to cram over 100 models in a small section of a department for Lenovo and expected not only engineering but technicians to just be able to pick these new computers up and just be able to work on them. Floor supervisors never even communicated with the engineer team, they themselves up and decided our site can handle it because six cherry picked technicians went to Louisville and outperformed their technicians. This is a job site, not a community college center.

2019-10-04, Director,"Santa Clara, CA","Current Employee, more than 3 years",Not a 3.7 Star Company,"Parking is easy. Suburban and corporate offices are easy to access but the locations makes for a tough commute. I have two female MBA colleagues who I confided in regularly. So international trips are energizing (but we've had so many travel bands it is nearly impossible). Kinda sad I can't think of anything else. I even took a salary cut to ""get more operational experience."" My bad I guess. Salaries are 20-30% under market here.
","The Glassdoor review at 3.7 stars unfortunately does not give a complete or reflective impression of the experience at Flex. In Texas and the Bay Area, in and around HQ, the experience is generally fair to poor.

Of the four jobs I've had in my life I've never been in such a bad culture. What is made worse is that the company is not doing well. Focus on Wall Street expectations when we're already having a hard time with our stock value puts even more pressure on the teams. It drops below 10 when our competitors seem to be doing something correct and only growing.

The lack of trust, the overall disorganization (leadership especially but also the computer tools and the human resources/training) is constant. We are talking every single day about how hard it is to get anything accomplished. If you look at my grad school friends and the companies they work for... the experience of disorganization is just so odd to them. 

The health care solutions group sells a good game but in the end leadership is uninspiring and not trusted. The international-based project managers tend to be a bit cold to American female professionals. The branding of Flex and the wide range international review of Flex on Glassdoor do not seem to reflect many locations in North America. 

Advice: have second thoughts talking to a Flex recruiter
Advice to Management
How do you build trust with mid-level employees? How do you raise salaries? How do you improve the companies position with Wall Street? How do you start with getting more organized? Our computer systems are terrible... how do you start to improve this?

2019-09-19, Health Care Division,"San Jose, CA","Current Employee, more than 5 years",Fading 2017-present,"Company: Next time there is a review you can go online. Marketing team is a good group, fighting the hard fight in EMS. Reduced investment in innovation makes their job harder.

Personal Experience: Systems and Supply Chain experience plus marketing events like CES. I can hide out with customers and not have to deal with the school yard dynamics of the VPs.
","Company: For the last few years it seems like it has gone from full attention to fading attention. Our competitors steal / win our customers. The VPs seemed so stress, one had to go see a therapist due to reorgs. 

Pressure is intense. Hard to see your boss going through hardtimes (at work!).Joke we share: 5 characteristics of Company Leadership Style - Think Stress, Analysis Stress, Execute Stress, Fake Not Being Stressed, Measure Stress

Personal Experience: The reason I'm motivated to write: I am a new parent and the support has been lacking. I have been surprised by the gender attitudes towards new mothers and fathers (men are given a hard time). 

I work 50-60 hours plus 15 hours commuting. There is no flexibility and there is no culture to support flexiblity. There is a group of us that gather for lunch and I'm tired of the constant complaining and poor treatment (the friends are great and I worry they will be leaving one by one as the company is having hard times).

I'm sharing this on Glassdoor because HR is so bad and we distrust them so much that I do not feel comfortable sharing these issues with them. Leaders at the director, VP and President level are either too busy, stress or act like politicans to really have impact.

10% (10% of my colleagues, team, leadership are of the highest quality).
Luckily my commute is so manageable it keeps me here.
","Contract manufacturing culture, attitudes and lack of willingness to improve, invest or inquire.
So lean that it hinders ability to succeed (team level; group level).

Lack of investment in people; easy to move, layoff, reassign.
Very challenging to hire; most not interested; poor brand & reputation; low salaries and behind the curve.
Systems are decades old. Improvements (CRM) are implemented poorly.

2019-08-26, Global Program Manager,"Milpitas, CA","Current Employee, more than 5 years",Great Company to Work For,"There is a lot of opportunity for advancement and to change career focus with this company. There is also the opportunity to transfer to other sites within the company both domestically and abroad. 

A truly international company that affords you the opportunity to work and interact with colleagues from all over the world. 

The workforce is highly diversified as is the management from bottom to top. The company also promotes women within the workforce, particularly as engineers and managers. 

The company knows manufacturing and does a good job at it. It is a great learning experience to understand how efficient volume manufacturing works.
","The company has a low profit margin (somewhere in the 2 to 3% range). As a consequence, it operates very lean and this has a direct impact on resource availability and work life balance. 

Work life balance can get seriously out of whack. It depends what is your position in the company. At the manufacturing sites, for instance, the MEs and PMs are driven pretty hard. Very long hours. Very thin on resources. 

As a global PM, there can be a lot of travel (often international) involved, varying widely from 20-30% to close to 90%. Keeping tabs on programs overseas also means long days and late night calls with overseas facilities. 

Continuously changing company, always in some state of flux. The organizations within the company seem to undergo continuous changes with large changes (re-orgs) every few years

Compensation is lower than you would see at Google or other Tech company.

Multi-skilled employees are under rated and are not assigned with new projects.

Hiring for one job and putting that employee in an another job which degrades the quality the work.

No quality measurement of work

Fake numbers on Dashboard and the same is propagated as right.

As a result, we are the most protected from layoffs and leadership change. It will be a rocky year but hopefully IMHO we'll keep focused on production, free cash-flow, reductions-in-force and facility costs. Finance team is global with diverse colleagues, working hard.
","The President of the HRS / Healthcare business is not respected. The only reason we're doing well is due to the general demand for healthcare products. But the corrosive, fear based yet ""nice"" guy approach is not lost on the top managers. We get it. As Directors, Facilities, Controllers and PM, we have lost our confidence. Now with the new CEO change, it is even more apparent healthcare leadership does not know what to do. The decision to cut and restructure is not difficult and expected. Structured support and investment is the hard work. Not sure where the value added comes from?

CEO Advaithi, If you expect to keep mid and top level management, you need to switch out leadership. There is hope and high expectation in HQ and NA offices (TX, MI, MA, CT, MX) that you will rebuild this company. It would be great to see a bold move on replacing the President of HRS.

Survey the last 12 directors and vice presidents and ask them their 360 feedback and you might hear a similar trend.

Can gain good knowledge on supply chain and business flows. No pressure, no team politics(not sure about other teams). Team outings quarterly. Insurance benefits.
","What to say, there are many things
1. No equal Importance(Ur thoughts, works, ur requirements will not be entertained).
2. Salary increment is too low and no promotions(only after 3yrs u ll get that too manager only will decide which is too difficult since they wont have interest to give u ha ha ha).
3. None of your jobs will be recognized (only few teams do that).
4. No updated software systems. Still works with older software which are less used in outside market. So if you want to search job in the same domain it is very difficult to get.
5. 90 days notice period which many companies will not entertain. Flex is very strict in that making sure that you r not getting other opportunities or either be as slave always. 
6. Made to lose at least one of your bonus(deducted from your salary) either u join or u leave the company(master piece).
7. u feel pressure, overload and wanted to relax, go out or go to pantry. u have sports room which ll be always blocked for some useless purpose.
8. Useless Administration team. Never responds to your needs(especially Taramani branch)
9. Good Transport facility but with bad vendor support. Works with some politics. one route provided with AC bus and others with old scrap's but charges equally for all. don't know what to say.
10. Many internal training programs but only few helps while others are just time pass and no training on technologies.
11. You may lose your job if no one supports you from top management. Lay off may happen any time so do something(show like u r working) to hold your seat.

Being able to move to other facilities thst have opening is great but people make decisions based on the information as presented.

Highly concerned and supportive for women safety and also provides job opportunities to physically challenged individuals.

Enhance cab facilities at least upgrade to A/C cabs during scorching summer.

Stop promoting people who are ill-equipped to lead. Define career paths options/growth options that offer longevity to people outside of corporate. Fix the bonus program. A site should not transfer a business that is losing money, make it profitable in the first month of operation at the new site and then not get a bonus because of the costs related to the project to transfer the business in the first place.

2019-07-31, Repair Technician,"Memphis, TN","Former Employee, more than 1 year",Idiots hiring idiots,"Great experience for entry level IT related positions.
","When I first started at the beginning of the year we were working 60 hours mandatory. Eventually they decided to cut our hours because they had hired on too many people. People who didn't know a single thing about what they were doing. I'm surprised they let people like that through the door for an interview, let alone hiring them. After the work shortage, we had to work less than 40 hours. You'd be lucky if you got 35 hours. Most people sat around doing nothing, or sat on the same laptop for a few hours after most of the work was gone. Those who tried to do more work and show off did the 'failed' units. Most of which were always available in the morning. But with idiots running around grabbing the failed laptops early on, they left nothing to be done in the evening for anybody to achieve 40 hours. Now they say they're paying more and their hours have gone up. That is wrong. Everything about this company and their hiring standards is just wrong.
Advice to Management
Close down the Memphis, TN location. All the supervisors don't know anything about computers. They have no clue what they're doing half the time. When a supervisor would try to talk to you, they'd brush you off within seconds when they see that a woman is trying to talk to them. So shut it down, go find somewhere more decent with acceptable work standards.

I learned a lot during my time at Flex, and while I enjoyed the work I did and my role at the company, I would not work there again.
","Micromanagement from senior leadership.
Contract employees kept as contractors for years on end, because management didn't want to spend the money to hire them on directly.
Poor time management on projects, from the top down.
Employees are expected to work far more than 40 hours a week on a regular basis.
Too few employees and too much work to spread among them.
Advice to Management
Stop outsourcing to temp agencies for your engineers: take the time to interview and hire good people, and pay them what they're worth. If you offer crap pay, you're going to get crap employees and output. 
The solution to poor hiring decisions should not be to hire more senior managers. 
Listen to your bottom-rung employees, the ones who have been around for awhile. They know what's up far better than a visiting consultant from corporate HQ.

It seems that if you get paid above the company average you are expected to give the company your life and all free time. There is a ""60 hour"" cap for exempt (hourly) workers but management won't do much for you as a salaried worker unless you have a good relationship with them. 

HR is joke and will sweep things under the rug to avoid having to do paperwork or escalate the situation. 

As stated above, you won't see yourself up the corporate ladder without active engagement in politics and brown nosing. 
 If you have a good enough relationship with upper middle management, you
 can forget worrying about dealing with your peers directly.

For applying to positions within the company, your manager's approval is required (not the con in this situation.) There is an engineer who worked tirelessly to lose the respect of not only his entire department, but every department in which he has worked with during his time at the company. He not only showed very little technical aptitude, he has close to no work ethic, very little respect for anyone he works with, and an extremely poor attitude. Since he has a nose for superiors, he got to work as soon as he realized who the power players were and developed ""relationships"" with the ones that weren't intelligent enough to realize that he was only using them to climb to the next rung. 
 This is anecdotal, but I'm sure his manager liked him as little as all of the 
 people that he worked with and almost surely would not approve of his 
 internal transfer request. But nonetheless, he got a promotion (grade level 
 for sure, unsure of compensation) to the department headed by the 
 individual that he sucked up to.
Advice to Management
Be more mindful of the morale of employees. It seems that hard work, more often than not, goes unrewarded; unless you count the occasional halfhearted compliment. 

Demonstrate more emotion intelligence when dealing with the people that work to make your job necessary.

","Honestly, if you believe you have the talent to fulfill the job, look elsewhere. This company is so unorganized and unprofessional. From day 1, you can see how unorganized the place is. I was trained incorrectly and had to learn everything from other techs. Your work space is tiny (smaller than a jail cell). People are always stealing your work tools, which has zero resolutions even if you tell a supervisor. Pay raise? Forget about it. I worked for 6 months with one pay raise, which became the base pay a month later. They basically told me to suck it up and do better so I could earn the raises. You have to nearly be perfect to receive a single dollar raise. When you bring it up to management, they never get back to you. The engineers that are in place to help are arrogant, yet ignorant. If you care about finding a place to work that’s worth your time, I suggest anywhere else.

Vice Presidents and General Managers seem to be digging into the one thing that Flex does very well: bureaucracy. The trouble is we continue to be very weak around customers and what they need. Weak around recruiting, salary and winning talent.

2019-04-30, Engineering Team (Senior),"Plano, TX","Current Employee, more than 5 years",Terrible Decisions and Confusing Leadership,"Technical work is satisfying. Co-workers that are good to work with. There is one or two good customers a year. But this changes. Every year colleagues leave or are let go. Customers have become frustrated with our process and slower pace. Innovation was once a priority.
","I'm writing this review because despite a new CEO (Advaithi; thank you for taking the time to visiting locations and congratulations on the role), morale remains low and the context continues to become worse. First, we're being beat by our competitors. Lost deals and customer feedback. Second, there is total leadership confusion around important innovation and technology development. We've lost 3-4 great leaders in the last year. In Plano we had a GM that was moved out. In Boston they have had about 4 GMs in three years! The most recent one, albeit nice and engaging, only has an apparel background. Low approach management. Flex closed the San Fran office. Milipitas has been shifted, reorged and impacted by layoffs. Word from the grapevine is that our amazing Design Team in New Hampshire will be cut and moved to Plano and Italy. The point is... there is confusion and not a lot of confidence. We make do.
Advice to Management
The problem seems to be coming from the 6th floor way out in San Jose. New CEO but same senior leaders. Might it be time for Advaithi to bring in a new team? Reduce the confusion by reducing the churn and fear.

2019-04-19, Program Manager,"Buffalo Grove, IL",Former Employee,Complex and demanding,"Good compensation and benefits; business is stable and growing. Laptops and VPN facilitate working from home.
","Office procedures are very, very complex, and no formal training is provided to carry out those procedures. This makes for an extremely difficult onboarding process. Program managers only find out what they need to do at the time it is needed, and thus have to figure it out and execute it at the same time, often in situations that are already urgent. Subject matter experts are stretched thin, placing additional burden on them and other employees. Also work/life balance is not that good due to these demands. PMs work occasional (or frequent) evenings and weekends to stay caught up.
Advice to Management
Provide site-specific training to Program Managers. PM Prime is not that helpful. Don't get rid of it, but improve it to make it site-specific.

If you miss your cab without informing conservatively 2days in a row they cancel your prepaid cab facility.

Their notice period is of 90days in which they change your project and expect you to work on 2 projects for next 90days

Engineering projects are positive. Pay is lower than general technology but higher than competitors. San Jose location is nice and office space progressive. Free breakfast x1 (but with layoffs it seems people are more down at gatherings).
","For all professional and advance degree job searchers I would be very cautious. The CEO just announced retirement, the stock has had two significant drops (~50%), the cross town competition is hiring our talent, we have had multiple layoffs that what we understand will continue into the new year, our business struggles around the basics (supply chain) and difficult (innovation). 
There are flaws in the new marketing leadership, gaps in human resources and the time and energy around systems and processes is brutal. A quick survey of the team highlighted that 1/5 of people's time is on unnecessary process. That is one day a week. Imagine.
Advice to Management
Buck the cycle... cost reductions, hiring freeze, travel ban, layoffs since spring. No investment in marketing, innovation, IT, training (all things our competitors have been doing). Uncertainty around the CEO search. There will be a lot of brain drain.

2018-08-31, Middle Management,"San Jose, CA","Former Employee, more than 5 years",Middle management,"Many of my peers and employees were smart people, very hardworking. Plenty of opportunities to learn, especially if you are a self starter. I had a couple happy years there hence the 2 stars, when I was working for a great boss. Some of the factories are absolutely world class. Office in San Jose is nice, spacious, light and has a nice cafe. I liked working with so many different people in different countries. Pay is ok until you really consider how many hours you are working.
","Hours of endless calls at night with teams in Asia, and endless travel to Asia all in economy class. 12-16 hours days are the norm as is waking up to 200 emails. Org shuffle that occurred in Feb was purely political and many of the right people got let go or reshuffled. Very few senior women at the company, they have all left or been let go. This is a true boys club. I left before the stress gave me a stoke and I’m so happy I did. I didn’t realize how miserable this place really was until I left and now have my evenings back. New management wants everyone in the office from 9-5, regardless of the fact you have been on the phone the night before till 1am, and have calls that start at 6am. Ems is a grind, but this place is the worst. If you can work here, you can work anywhere. In a weird way I’m happy for the time I spent here because it’s made me appreciate my new job so much.
Advice to Management
The reorg in feb was completely ridiculous. Try assessing everyone and promoting the right people vs laying off or demoting everyone who isn’t in your boys club. There is a lot of great talent you have pushed to the side. Wake up. Make the current COO CEO, he’s the only one left over there with any sense. You also might want to try to keep the few women VPs you have left ( there’s not many so they should be noticeable). Also, not everyone can do the job you want to promote them into (because they are your friends). Try looking at people’s experience and skill sets before putting them in jobs they aren’t qualified for.

2018-08-11, Project Manager,"San Jose, CA","Former Employee, more than 1 year",Great place to work until Jan 2018,"Depending on which group you work in, your experience can vary greatly. I was really lucky to have joined a great team with a boss who demanded hard work but rewarding experiences. Again and again I was allowed to work on opportunities that were challenging yet fun.
","In Jan 2018 the company started laying off hundreds maybe even thousands of people. They did it in a very unprofessional manner. Leaving those remaining completely on edge. Instead of announcing a one time lay off, the company slowly laid off groups here and there. I suspect that they were trying to avoid media attention to maintain vendor and supplier relationships. The lay off period started in Jan 2018, maybe even before, and is still on going... Of course this meant each time a major exe or team was laid off, those remaining would have to react to the change just to react again when that the new management was laid off after only been appointed a month ago. This caused the all the systems to collapse and complete chaos within the company. Not to mention extremely low morale.
Advice to Management
We get it, the company has fallen on hard times. But please be more considerate of those you lay off and those remaining. Do a one time lay off instead of stringing people along. All your good employees will leave if you do this. Also make up your minds. Stop changing directions every few days. Those remaining are exhausted and have no direction.

2018-04-16,Anonymous,"Austin, TX",Former Employee,A sea of paranoia and stress.,"I worked out of the Austin site. Although it is a depressing building full of outdated technology and a WIFI network that goes down about as often as North Korea's electrical grid, they are trying to make strides to bring the building into the 21st century with some remodels. I worked in the “Corporate Area.” It is a recent construction that we are required to work out of. The work was easy and I actually loved the work part.
","This part does not encompass all my issues, but I will do my best to address the main points. The work area is new but does not make it nice. We are required to work in the office that has tiny bathrooms that often require you to wait in a line when you have to “go.” You can also go downstairs to the manufacturing area and use their bathroom that would feel similar to a run-down minor-league baseball stadium experience. The ""Corporate Area"" only has windows on one side so most people not close to them gets the old government building experience. Once would think with the “work from the office” mandate, we would get a nicer place to work. My desk was near the break “room” which was basically an area with vending machines and sinks. It was “awesome” to have people walking behind me all day, every day. 


The people are a mix bag of over-stressed, paranoid and generally unhappy people with a combination of fake pleasantness towards each other. This definitely comes from leadership as most of them are “climbers.” I had multiple leaders and the ones that identified with their employees are all gone only to be replaced with those who are too focused on their own careers to truly be concerned with the well-being of their teams. I never truly fit in with this culture even though I found myself being promoted at one point. 

The work was somewhat easy for me but don’t let that fool you. Even though my job was easily measured, I was always led to believe I was doing “half-ass” work. I still keep up with a lot of people there. The more time I am away from this job, the more I see just how miserable they really are, and I feel sorry for them. I also met some really great people there. One truly does find camaraderie through adversity.
Advice to Management
My advice would be to really think about what it takes to provide a good company culture. As the labor market tightens, you will ultimately be stuck with 2nd-tier employees because you provide them a 2nd-tier existence.

9 Apr 2018 - Accounting Manager in Austin, TX
Recommend
CEO Approval
Business Outlook
Pros
Decent benefits, but low 401K match.
Cons
Be aware here! The leadership is very dishonest, they change their mind often, and they hire and lay off employees constantly (layoffs twice per year are common). New employees do not have any stability, and they are first to go during constant layoffs. Senior managers will lay off many base line employees who have 1-3 years tenure, then re-post identical positions hoping to get cheaper workforce. Most new non-managerial and lower management hires get laid off in their first 2 years even if they received great year end reviews. When it comes to layoffs, the employee's performance does not matter! Unless you are related to senior management or you have been with the company last two decades, you will be let go via layoffs, and within days your position will be re-posted for barely cheaper workforce. Senior managers do not care about the people who work for them. They shift blame to lower ranking employees, and they do not take accountability. It is common for you to catch a senior manager directly lying to you.
Advice to Management
The senior accounting/ finance leadership that has 10-30 years tenure is killing new talent because they are do not have good understanding of basic tasks and processes, managers are disorganized, they change direction without reviewing and analyzing data, they constantly fear of being replaced, and they are often using new hires as escape goats.

","You will probably get laid off before you find your next job. 
The clowns at the top are finally getting caught running things into the ground from their gross negligence and incompetence. Once again they saved their own skin and have liquidated an entire business unit. Hundreds, if not thousands of people walked out in the US.
Advice to Management
Fire yourselves! 
Management is so arrogant, negligent, irresponsible, incapable, incoherent and incompetent they wouldn't even know I was writing about them. From the CEO down, you need to admit to shareholders you are failures and have wasted millions upon millions of their dollars and you need to be purged.

Advice to Management
Advise to management is to build more resources with people who are doers and less talkers. Focus more on content instead of cosmetics (image) of the values. There are too many politicians claiming value and not enough executive management to deliver value. Actions prove the reluctance to change with the need.

","Crappy benefits for large company that size with crappy bureaucracy. It’s people acting to protect their jobs regardless of anyone else at the bottom. They try and persuade you that they are forward looking company looking to compete in turnkey engineering. That they are high tech and cool people to work with. Management was very ambitious with that thought and right people it probably would’ve work but it was marred by poor execution and lack of hiring top managers (executing visions) and workers willing to put plan into actions. As an ex-Flex employee job was routinely boring, our leaders didn’t inspire confidence and just not fun working there. Then we met our demise as a group so they can avoid paying final retention bonuses. Oh well you get what you paid for. My advise don’t work there unless you like S&M or you already in the higher ups or mindless worker bees.

","I was tasked by 'other' persons of management to do other tasks- my direct boss allowed this to happen so it felt like I was working for 'many bosses'. After being very successful at training my own successes became my downfall. I was then being tasked to 'other duties' that was not my daily role. Instead of my boss telling other management that I still had a job to do he facilitated this behavior which created a LOT of stress upon me so much so I had to resign.
Advice to Management
Don't lie to your employees. Respect your own chain of command. Try not to 'railroad' your best employees while giving a free pass to those who are not even productive. Try to be fair and consistent. Try to provide a 'pathway to success' to your employees instead of stagnation. Don't be a 'bully' and try to 'railroad' your employees when they point out your own tyrannical practices.

","This was once a great company, but the previous owner stopped investing in the business before it was sold to Flex. As a result the equipment is outdated, and the building is seriously over crowded. Any kind of company culture is non existent. Now where to sit during break or lunch, had to sit down on any chair I could find, and one chair broke while I was sitting on it. This is the first place that I have worked where they do not provide prescription safety glasses, as a result if you need to wear prescription glasses you have to wear your everyday glasses or go out and buy your own. Also I have seen one of the ladies that works in the front office walking around in the shop wearing flip flops instead of safety shoes.

2017-07-07, Network Engineer,"Austin, TX","Former Employee, more than 1 year",this place is a joke,"great work/life balance, because nobody really understands what needs to happen or is accountable for anything.
 - this is within the global/corporate networking team... so results might vary, but from what I can tell... people were scarcely in the office and coming/going whenever they felt like it.
","I will break this down by things that are general to anybody to things that were more specific to me.

the building:
 - super old (70s) and the type of people reflect that
 - feels like an abandoned middle school
 - only the part you will enter and interview has been renovated, so don't let that trick you. take 20 second to walk anywhere else to feel the reality of it
 - smelled like wet socks constantly
 - somehow was hotter/more humid inside than it was outside (which is insane for texas)

interview/hr:
 - make sure you understand who your manager will be. my manager changed from the one I was told it was during the interview process (and enjoyed) to another person who interviewed me and was clueless.
 - make sure you understand what your tasks will be in reality. what was told to me as things they wanted to do where radically different than what they had planned for me (and never communicated).
 - on day 1, during benefits sign up... I was looking at the plan to choose and saw two numbers for the cost. I asked the hr lady, ""what is this second number?"" the reply, ""oh, that is what flex will pay for you"". so i asked, ""why show that number?"" the reply, ""so you can be grateful"" ... are you kidding me!?!
 - your benefits do _not_ start on day 1. they start on the 1st of the month. so if you start on the 15th... you're waiting a couple weeks for any benefits to be active. that was _never_ communicated to me and was a big shock on day 1, and for a guy with a 3 month old baby... was not a very good shock.

team/manager:
 - this is specific to me or anybody going into the global/corporate networking team
 - there is an enormous divide in talent... you have the somewhat knowledgeable architects and then the operations team that are basically all new people learning networking concepts. this breeds a huge attitude and power trip by the architects who hog any training for themselves to pad their resumes.
 - nobody was accountable for anything. in fact, during a week long exercise to do something, the last day there was time set aside to do a ""lessons learned""... which was quickly de-railed by somebody changing the subject because the lessons learned would point out their mistakes.
 - my situation is pretty obvious... i had a manager that was a 'yes man' and failed up and was clueless about anything related to network automation/programming. so anything i said was just falling on deaf ears with a glazed over look and then thrown out the window.
 - I actually heard the phrase ""I expect you to learn from these things"" and when I asked what ""things"" he was referring to (literally, was never defined), the reply was ""I don't have any examples, but I expect you to learn from it. And I have now officially said this to you, so please learn"" ... you can imagine that a completely ridiculous statement like that from your manager is very scary. I mean, ""learn X"" without defining X. wtf is that?! so weird.
Advice to Management
Do not fail up people who are clueless to the role you want them to now lead.
Actually hold people accountable for the flashy things you say and want to do.
Fix the seating arrangement.... don't think that ""open workspace"" means that you put a big long table and you sit guys 1 foot away from each other. that's just prison.

2017-06-15,Anonymous,,"Current Employee, more than 5 years",Beware of old boys' buddy club and family hiring,"Competitive salaries and quarterly bonus.
","Work-life balance, nepotism, unfair pay and extreme lack of gender diversity among upper management. For the same title and workload, salaries can be significantly varied based on negotiation and favoritism. If one belongs to the old boys' buddy club all the way up to the executive level, that person can get promoted twice in a year vs an average person can get stuck in the same position for many years if not forever at 0%-3% merit raise. Some team and certain people within the same team can be extremely idle with minimum workload while other people or other teams can have big workload and work 60-70 hours per week - it all depends on the manager.
Advice to Management
Promote gender diversity among upper management, fair pay per workload, and work-life balance because it will reinvigorate new ideas, productivity, happiness and better culture to retain talents and competitiveness. Stop promoting the non-qualified but favorite, brown-nose buddy or family members because it will set the culture of incompetency and inefficiency. Work smart, instead of doing long hours of non-valued added activities.

OK PTO and 401K match.
Medical is good network, but high deductible plans.
","IT support is mostly in India. Support for CAD tools is in India, and they don't seem to understand the day to day use that engineers put the CAD tools to.
Each group seems to be very separate from other groups. So, the same problem could be being addressed by multiple groups rather than collaborating.
Very short term cost focused.

2017-01-22, Depot Manager,,"Former Employee, more than 5 years",Just don't,"I learned a lot about cell phone technology and met some juice people.
","Where. To. Begin. 

Flextronics/flex used to be so great. Our senior management often recognized achievements (and anniversaries). Once they brought in senior management from the failed vzn project, everything started going down hill. 

Not only did we have people in charge that were in charge of a project that failed, they didn't know what our jobs, on the front line, were. I am of the belief that those in upper management should know what their front line does and can do it themselves. That was not the case. 

Directive were constantly changing, without input from those that would have to implement them. So many failed ideas that ultimately hurt the customer in the long run. 

And the cherry on top is now they are completely shattering the current project. After a disastrous 2 years under this leadership. I fell so bad for all of my former coworkers who are know scrambling to find employment when they busted their butts to fulfill these lofty goals that were set.
Advice to Management
There is none because you didn't listen in the first place. Your Depot managers and employees told you what wasn't working and you didn't care. You just wanted it done your way, which consistently failed. Now everyone is out of a job. Congrats.

","You have to be in the loop to know. If you're not friends with the right people, example supervisors, your job will be at risk.

Stop being friends with employees below you. It shows that their job is more secure than the ones you don't try to notice. Some of us ship and do more than those that have been there for years and never get fired all because you come to the floor and only talk to them.
