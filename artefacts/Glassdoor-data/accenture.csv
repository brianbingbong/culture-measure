2020-09-14, Analyst,Canberra,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Air of enthusiasm as they are ever growing it seems, lots of opportunity for vertical mobility","The people. There are a lot of them in every major city. That means that there's almost certainly someone like you already working for the company and they are loving it. When joining (or even prior) you should try and find that person. Maybe you have an IT background or law or business. Finding them will be a lot easier because there will be a lot of them around. The work. Accenture is very forward-thinking. To stay on top of the innovation game, you have to have people willing to think analytically and solve problems. Not necessarily problems no-one has solved before. Innovation doesn't mean reinventing the wheel every couple months. Many times it's learning about and applying a known method or practice to a business or area of life that has never benefited from that critical thought. The opportunity. Internally there is a treasure-trove of content to learn and consume. They sell themselves as being the biggest online university world-wide. They might be. With a company this large there is always something going on, whether grad events engaging with universities or schools, community events like BBQs or fun runs, mentoring opportunities, or working groups of just some like-minded energetic people that get together to do something fun on the side. One last thing. If you perform, you are rewarded. Some people go from graduate to manager in as little as 3 years (rare). But there is certainly vertical mobility if you have the drive, the passion and the capacity.
","As a grad, you are a pawn to some. Like molding clay with no background or past that can be crafted into anything. Molding clay has no desire to be a pot or a cup. It does as it is told by the crafter. Not everyone sees you like this. Some fight for you to get the roles you want. But alas. There are good and bad apples everywhere in life. This is no different. The overtime time. What overtime pay? Not sure what that is... But really though it's rather abysmal. The only consolation is that if you get work that you really do love then overtime isn't going to feel like it so much. Not a good excuse but there isn't much else in it's defense.

","Unbelievably toxic culture, you cannot get promoted on merit but instead need to schmooze and network your way to a promotion.

The result is - almost all the people at the top are the kind of people with no regard for others, no integrity or EQ. The people who work really hard but don't blow their own trumpet are completely forgotten and don't get anywhere. A large number of people had no idea who they actually reported to because their system of reporting to the most senior person on a client account vs your own line manager, and doing performance reviews with a career councillor is confusing as hell. You can get outstanding reviews from all your managers and peers and someone else who is lazy will get promoted over you because someone in senior management likes them personally.

Too much cost cutting. If one part of business is struggling, other business promotions are affected. Ie less promotions & progression. Or some favourites get promoted if you have a good career counselor. Worklife balance is dependent on project & client in consulting. And some leaders still see working 24hrs as the evidence of delivering work vs those who might do same work in 8hrs. You will not get cozy family atmosphere.

Business Outlook
Pros
A strong focus on innovation and client-centric problem-solving means we are working at the forefront of some really interesting challenges and there are a lot of opportunities to learn. In the consulting workforce in particular, the pipeline of projects and roles is ever shifting and this results in a lot of variety of project experiences. There is a true growth mindset and conversations about growth are focused on individual strength and how each individual can be supported and given opportunities.
Cons
Sometimes the uncertainty of not knowing what project or role you will do next can be unsettling - but it is also exciting, and I would prefer this to the boredom of doing the same thing for a long time. It can also be challenging at times to balance project work and other side activities like supporting business development and organising office events alongside family and home life - but these extra activities are very rewarding, and most people I have worked with so far at Accenture are very supportive of maintaining work life balance.

Many account teams protect their 'tribe', so if you're not in their tribe keeping your chargeability high can be an issue. Not friendly to experienced hires - there's insufficient support to normalise into the culture and find your feet.

Training in H&PS is incredibly limited and is given to management before analysts despite advertising a first in-first served system. Performance cycle is different for analysts and is a time-based ""progression"" model - this discourages hard-workers and means you progress at the same rate as low performers.

Pros
Reasonably good work on offer if you can find it. Generally employees are well treated, I have personally not experienced any bullying as described in some other reviews.
Cons
People are just a number, focus on getting money by billing an employee and no focus on personal growth of the employee. Some senior managers are plain rude and snap at you if you ask questions. Promotions are definitely for people in visible Roles and not necessarily merit based. You need to be known to MDs to get promoted. That’s why they have extremely high attrition rates. The process is not transparent because it is made by MDs in closed rooms. Absolutely stupid excuses given for not promoting people. This means that the right people are promoted only about half the time.

Pros
Great people to work with, including local leadership who are tremendous. Global strategy seems right. It remains a great global company. Flexible working arrangements. Opportunities to accelerate career progression, if your focus is within Accenture. New acquisitions in the digital space are exciting. Work can be rewarding, if you are staffed on the right project.
Cons
Training opportunities significantly reduced in recent years. Localised training limits opportunties to connect with One Global Network. Silos between industry functions is impenetrable within the Consulting business and limits the opportunities for the firm to grow locally, and the type of work you are able to undertake at this location. Salary and benefits as a package is sub-par, perhaps owing to current local market conditions. This is a minor criticism and was previously offset by training opportunities/ access to and feeling part of one global network, and cross-industry collaboration.

Pros
Unfortunately, I cannot say anything positive about my experience at Accenture.
Cons
The corporate culture is truly toxic - this is not a collaborative or respectful team culture, rather colleagues will 'throw you under the bus' at any opportunity to make themselves look better. Bullying and harassment is common place and Management and HR don't care to do anything about it to fix the problem, but rather just pay-out those affected and make them sign a confidentiality agreement so the truth doesn't come out. An organisation without integrity or basic ethics!
