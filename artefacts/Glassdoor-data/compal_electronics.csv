2016-07-30, Senior Hardware Engineer,Taipei,Former Employee,Work hard and benifit less,"Work environment was fine, provide meal allowance when you are working late. Had chance to study a lot knowledge of product development and also work with top tier customers so could learn the know how with your own-self study. Good place for new graduated to discover how ODM company working.
","Without work overtime compensate. Worst promotion system, was decide how long you stay in the company but not consider your contribution. Limit employee ability of work due to company working flow. Very hard to balance the work and family because too much work & travel to China factory and too less pay.
Advice to Management
Don't try to cost reduction all the time. Stop to play SAFE!!! Manager was thinking as a old school style and just want to keep their position without taking any risk and it was major problem to prevent company grown up.

2016-04-14,Anonymous,,Current Employee,principal engineer,"A old stereotype Taiwanese company , might suit for those people who wanna a static working environment , who don't like change much. If you are a Taiwanese who work for this company for few years, very easy for you to get housing loan with very low interest. This might help for young men.
","On the opposite side , can be bored most of time if you really seek some really challenge and serious pay. As this company mainly focus on low profit ODM\OEM field. Long term gain can be worried.
Advice to Management
Seek high profit field seriously , and really take care the engineers income plz.
