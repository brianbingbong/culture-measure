Trust more on other nationalities and send other nationals as expats to other countries. 
Get rid of Korean language for the official company language, we are in 2021 and accept English as the one and only language.

2021-09-14, Management Associate,,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",Good as first job for fresh graduate,"1. Accepts graduates from a wide range of study disciplines.
2. Offers permanent role, therefore comes with good benefits and prestige.
3. Provides a support system especially as a newcomer in the company.
4. The pay is definitely in a competitive range in the market.
","1. The interview to get in is super tough, therefore, the expectations that come from being an MA is pretty high.
2. Career progression is not as guaranteed (not necessarily going to be promoted on a faster track, this is one possible misconception)
3. The branch acts as a sales and marketing arm of Samsung, therefore do not come in thinking you can do anything tech-related.
4. The work environment is very fast-paced, if you are in a busy department, either you are swamped with work/overworked OR are completely ignored because the seniors are too busy to train/guide you.
Advice to Management
If you are serious, do consult any of the existing MAs there to clear any confusion or concerns!

Work environment overall, as a Global Strategist, was pretty healthy, with good work/life balance and a very international working environment.
","Unfortunately, the long-term staying power is low and attrition high in the office. GSGers have standard 2yr contracts when entering, stipulating that you either must be allowed to stay in GSG or must go into the Korean-based organization before transferring out of Korea. Very few people are allowed to stay in GSG beyond the 2yr contract (project leader life is very busy anyway), and opportunities in Korea Samsung are often restricted and not very appealing, meaning that a large percentage of people leave after 2yrs. The transition from the Korea Samsung to other offices around the world is also difficult, with little support to make that jump.

2. Good transportation network across NCR.

3. Employees you'd actually have to work with, across teams, are usually nice and helpful.

4. Lots to learn, if you're interested enough to read code properly.
","1. Not much software or tasks to develop.

2. Management lacks spine, to stand up to HQ. Opinion of HQ is to be set in stone. Similarly, opinions of engineers don't matter, until the same is re-iterated by HQ and then management would actually believe. 

3. Disparate salaries for freshers from different colleges, for essentially the same work. Experienced engineers have lesser salaries than new-joiners.

4, Hard-work doesn't pay off for freshers (or anyone), if you're not in a position of importance. (Reasons will always be cited as bell-curve maintenance).

Advice to Management
Employees in Australia need to accept the culture rather than try to change it. Working there does help one grow but only to a certain extent before getting disillusioned or losing their humanity just to survive. 
There are good people who have not been playing the game and are still decent human beings. If you can hold on to them, well done. Note that it's not the usual bunch of people often recognised for their contributions.

Large scale of ops
","A small scale re-purposing of East India Company culture having Korean C-levels, VPs and next level Indian leadership as Zamindars & Khan Bahadurs.
Leadership is not very industry celebrated and in general lacks spine and vision, with rare exceptions, and indulged into zamindari feuds on work, team and credit grab.
Exceptionally few relate to the place, trust leaders, company or other teams, and vice versa.
Employee audits by multiple teams are a constant and the most indulging part. Actually, this is a reasonable step by Koreans given the compromised work ethics observed over time.
Well HR can be better titled as Harassment Resources than human... Succinctly, to be on blacklists for any decent MNC and big Indian Corporates and can be easily replaced by standard chatbots for efficient ops and lesser demotivation to junta. They have won awards for getting folks to Office during Covid in May and maximizing attendance.

Advice to Management
You cannot expect employees to work 60+ hour work weeks every week with little to no burn out. It would be one thing if there was a coherent and consistent strategy, but there is literally no strategy. Everything boils down to ""beat Apple"" (sorry.. ""beat LO""), or... ""what is the competition doing? Ok do that but faster and cheaper."" 

It's a great company to have on the resume, but get in and get out. Even 10+ year veterans are running for the hills.

","My first day at Samsung- At the lift lobby, There was total chaos. People were pushing each other to reach at Entry door for card punching. I was shocked to learn that timing is 8:30- 5:30 (HR didnt bother to tell me this befoe joining). A minute delay mean one day loss of salary.

My first day on floor- Floor has a look of Korean concentration camp where all Indians were sitting at one side and their Korean boss were sitting another side at big cubicle. Shocked to overheard Young Korean yelling at his old Indian subordinate in his fifties""You are fired"". Got to know from one of my colleague that Korean bosses yelling at Indian is not new in Samsung. 
Indian management do not listen to Indians, they wait for their Korean boss to respond. Even HR will disconnect your call abruptly and do not respond to your emails if you try to raise any question. 
Right from the time of onboarding experience till the time of exit, you will have worst experience in Samsung.
Your only Survival in Samsung is when you have nice Korean boss and he is happy with you. They try to vent their frustation by Yelling at Indians.
Advice to Management
Empower Indians by giving them authority for decision making

Advice to Management
Training is terrible. If you want to become a B2B organization, you need to invest in people and not data entry. You pay people $100+ salaries to do surveys, data entry, and run around like their pants are on fire. There is no consistencies in R&R and too many internal meetings (1 set with USA, 1 set with Korea) and not enough customer meetings.

","Male dominated environment leads to very aggressive styles bordering on bullying. Sales is the focus and marketing is not supported / seen as order takers.
Any project is slow to get off the ground as between 7-14 approvals are needed for any level of spend. Finance approvals for projects can take anywhere from 1 week to 1 month. 
Over 30% of time is spent chasing approvals and filling in extensive process documentation.
Little to no market research in certain divisions, lots of internal politics with mid senior levels undermining VP direction.
Huge turnover -- most people spend 3-5 years max. in company.
No work/life balance.
A lot of reporting, days and evenings spent writing and updating reports for the sake of showing work is being done.

","The company thinks and treats their employees as tools, not people. Its a vertical structure so if your boss is aweful you just have to accept it. Ive worked years at the company and never been treated so bad like in the last months. 
Rotation of people are fast. Average of people staying is 1 year. If you dont agree with your director or with your business manager, you have no chance to talk. You will never be heard. The amount of work is always a lot. I used to stay with my team up until 9pm almost everyday.

HR departament doesnt care for the employees. They care for whats best for the company, to dont get sued. And to control employees. So if an employee is not satisfied or motivated, they dont listen to him or her. They just qualificated as bad. 

I literally heard the bosses insulting people in their faces saying strong hurtful words. And nobody could say anything.
Advice to Management
People that always agree with everything are the ones that are afraid of saying whats on their mind. You shouldnt stay with sheeps that always say yes just to dont get in trouble. You should trust in people's talent and improve the way you treat them so they can stay.

2020-10-01, Human Resources Coordinator,,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",It's a no from me.,"Honestly there a few great people who are very smart. But move on quickly.
","Processes are out of date. Communication and clear expectations between parties is some of the worst I've seen. For one of the biggest tech companies, they use wildly behind the times software (they care more about the bottom line than the user experience is my guess at why they purchase such bad products) Company culture is just, bad. It's dead silent in any sort of capacity where we're supposed to be spur ideas/give feedback.
Advice to Management
Listen more than you talk. Value other's ideas - you'll have a more dynamic and brighter workplace and deliverables.

Advice to Management
Flatten the structure (7 level hierarchy makes communication slow - it is traditional for Korea, but not for European countries). 
Treat employees from different countires equally - in Poland whole Deep Learning and Computer vision experts team (even group leader, team leader) left to other, less famous companies that easily offer twice bigger salaries in same country. You are loosing talents and it gave Samsung a bad reputation in Poland, as low salary employer - good for a first job to quickly change it.
Employees in Korea with equal degree, skills and accompliishments, have 5 times higher salary than ones in Poland.

","Miles from anywhere and a nightmare to reach without driving. The company bus sits in traffic for hours, and that’s if you make it out of the office in time for it and aren’t working until late in the night.
You are expected to work all hours of the day and night, especially for monthly deadlines, for no extra compensation and if you don’t it’s frowned upon. Live to work attitude, not work to live. Head office say jump and you must respond with how high.
Most senior staff members placed from Korean HQ, so not a lot of career progression.
Most staff are temporary workers and are treated as secondary to full employees.
No understanding or compassion.

","I have Korean background, so I can talk about the actual issues. When I was there, and I am sure it will be the same, Korean employees from HQ are the problem. HQ is sending people to help local branches every 3 or 4 years, depending on their positions, but they won't respect local culture at all. They bring all bad Korean culture to work. Remember that managers in Korea HAVE TO be respected by employees. Managers are god. They can do whatever they want, and even humiliating you in public. This is what those people have. If you have Korean background, then good luck with that. If you don't have it, you will have less opportunities to get promoted. Yes, this is who they are. 

They prefer bi-lingual, because they can control employees badly. These Koreans don't have critical authority for hiring decision but they still do. Those Koreans love to get involved in anything and everything. During any meetings, if you don't get interrupted by them for 5 mins, then you are super lucky. They don't give you opportunities to speak at any meeting at all. I assume that they don't trust you in general. The best part of those Koreans is they are REALLY good at criticizing. They can find what your weakness is and what you did wrong. This is super easy for them. They have Phd for that. 

Korean culture has good and bad, and these people introduce all bad korean culture. Actually, HQ has much better culture based on what friends say. That's why Samsung Electronics reputation is higher on glassdoor than it should be. 

I still recommend it because work is rationally more than okay, and you can learn a lot. If you have ability to ignore their bad etiquettes and nagging, then you can work there. Good brand name on your resume too. Otherwise, you will get stress a lot.

2020-07-27, Lead Engineer,Noida,"Former Employee, more than 5 years",Not a place to grow or learn.,"You will get a timely salary. They have this competency test to keep checking your programming skills. So most people from Samsung you will find good in data structure. Good to show Samsung name on your resume only. You will have good debugging skills if you are given time to do so.
","Proper training is not there. You need to dig out yourself which is not an issue I believe unless someone starts poking you every now and then, like, ""what happened to this issue?"" , ""Did you complete?"" and then after some time ""do it fast issues are piling up"", ""What is taking you so much time to do this simple task?"".
I joined and left after 4.5 years (I know it sounds stupid but I was scared of the outside world as if I don't know anything, I can't answer any question(something like imposter syndrome) and I admit it). I changed only after every one of my close friends left finally.
The feeling I mentioned above was all because you don't get time to learn ever. If by chance you happen to open a page from where you can learn something, someone will surely poke you and ask ""Oh, so you are preparing for an interview?"". Gosh!! Micromanagement everywhere. 
They will overload you with the issues and would want you to fix it on that very day. You get issues at 5PM you should finish it even if it takes you 12AM midnight; you stay; you complete; you go. (In some teams of course and unluckily it was mine). You are nothing but a bug fixer in the eyes of HQ guys. But I think you can learn more and get into any flow deeper if you are in Korea or in the Bangalore team than in the Noida office. You get into it, stay for 1.5 years or so and just leave(as most of the new joiners are doing there). Due to their competency test, you can be in touch with DS and try applying in top companies.
Advice to Management
Nothing, they do what they want to do. They can stop you from going home (and at worst, they will call you back to office when you are midway to your home and will threaten you with severe consequences if not done so).

Was told in daily basis that work is more important than home/family life. Paid time off /vacation and sick time are the same. Even with doctor statement you are still punished on point system. Have to give 24 hours notice to use PTO or sick time and avoid punishment points. Very little off time work 6 days every week no matter what. They never promote from within. Very disrespectful to employees. Everyone is overworked and exhausted all the time. High turnover rate.

","HR leadership. The leadership fails in every way possible. Racism exist but even when you go to the top it's still not being recognized that things need to change.
Advice to Management
My advice is take a look at management and inside the heart of your company's Human Resources. It's interesting that even if you call the hotline or bring notice to the racism nothing will be done. Those that are put in place to help employees deal with these things make empty promises. I was told that my incident would be looked into by the Employee Relations leader in Frisco Texas and she never checked into it. It was almost like she was avoiding me because she never followed up. No matter how I tried to bring light to what was going on regarding HR nothing got done. I was not the only victim there where several of us being overlooked and being denied the opportunities that our white peers were given. What's interesting is I was warned by the very person that hired me. She ended up leaving the company for the very reason I'm posting this. She had a master's degree in human resources, SHRM certification, not to mention several years of experience. They hired someone that didn't have her credentials but had the right skin tone ""white"". This most agregious thing was being a person with several degrees, experiences and being passed up by those that didn't have close to my Background or education. At every turn they came up with excuses as to why they would not hire me nor those that look like me. Samsung has a very high turn around rate in HR because of this reason right here. The most interesting part was I was told that this happens over and over and over again yet nothing has been done. It's very disconcerting to now that in 2020 you're still being discriminated against because of the color of your skin. It's very ugly when you do everything you can to shine a light on it but still it keeps going and being ignored. So the hotline doesn't nor does employee relations doesn't work so what's next? What I experienced was them trying to hurry up and get rid of me. My advice deal with human resources leadership start from the top and work your way down and you will see.

2020-05-15, Department Head,Sydney,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",Avoid at all costs! Run!,"Product discounts, a few nice people
","Where to begin? Zero leadership, strategy, culture and values, extreme micro management and complete disempowerment, complete lack of trust in employees, very hierarchical, systems and processes that are decades old, unusable and work against you, people and teams that actively work against you, only “yes” people remain whilst all the good staff are pushed or leave, not a place for growth, the ONLY thing that matters is short term sales/revenue growth, absolutely no thought for future sustainable growth, more is more, more sales promotions, more discounts, MORE!
Advice to Management
IF there is a desire to be a great workplace (I stress IF, because I don’t believe they actually value employees or the workplace), then I would hire only locals into senior leadership roles (on long term contracts), and remove all expats. This would solve a myriad of problems. Oh, and focus on long term sustainable growth driven by a solid strategy.

2020-03-08, Marketing Manager,"London, England, England","Current Employee, more than 1 year",A fantastic company to start your career at,"The size and scale of Samsung might give outsiders the expectation that those in entry-level positions are a very small cog in a far larger machine. In my experience this was anything but the case. 

SEUK gives those who want to take on new opportunities and challenges, every chance to do so. I joined as a graduate, and in that time worked on projects and accounts that I never expected I'd be able to. 

Hard work is very much rewarded, and while the extrinsic, financial rewards and incentives are a big plus, its the intrinsic satisfaction from the role that Samsung provides. However, I have no doubt that this varies from department to department, but based on my time there, I'd recommend Samsung to anyone.
","Top-down leadership is very much a factor, but I'd wager this is the same with most multi-national brands.

Internal processes and systems can be slow and arduous at times, with work sometimes being held up by approvals and software issues.

2020-03-04,Anonymous,Singapore,"Current Employee, less than 1 year",Samsung RHQ - Never experienced such a company culture elsewhere,"Good salary, Reputable MNC, Staff discount for Samsung products
","While the culture at Samsung is generally toxic, it varies by departments. Not trying to play the race card here but departments with majority Koreans are generally more toxic. If your direct boss is Korean, good luck. Each department is helmed by a Korean BM. The reason why it’s called “Korean BM” is because the position is only reserved for Koreans. It’s no secret that Koreans are favoured in this company and career progression is limited if you’re non-Korean. They’re also exclusive and tend to speak in Korean amongst themselves. Working here is like living in a Korean drama every day. The culture here is extremely hierarchical, bosses love to micromanage and do not give two hoots about their subordinates' opinions. People here tend to groupthink since in Korean culture, having a different opinion is frowned upon. It's no wonder Samsung is falling behind Apple in terms of innovation. Also, senior management tend to throw their weight around and are verbally abusive (seeing the management yell at their subordinates, slamming things, etc is a very common sight). 

Samsung’s management leads by fear and not by example. Machiavelli's ""better to be feared than loved"" philosophy describes their management style and they’re truly an epitome of Machiavellian style leadership. This can be seen from Samsung's implementation of a clock-in system whereby notifications are sent out to the department heads even if an employee is just a few minutes late. Notifications are also sent out if one under-clocks by a mere few minutes. E.g. if you start work at 9am, something urgent cropped up, and you leave at 5:58 rather than 6pm, the system would send a notification to your boss and you would then have to submit a valid reason in the system on why you under-clocked, for your boss's approval. Employees at Managerial level and above are also not allowed to carry any unused annual leave forward. Work from home is not permitted as well so staying late to OT is a must. In view of COVID-19, the company has allowed quarantined employees to work from home. Even then, activity and hours clocked on their laptops are tracked. Company has plenty of other rigid systems in place, such as mandatory use of their outdated in-house email portals. You also have to submit tedious approval requests for every single thing and the red tape in this company contributes to inefficiency at work.

P.S. It seems like the average ratings here are pulled up by retail staff/promoters. If you look at ratings from corporate staff, they're mostly negative.

Cake day
","Contractors and Permanent staff getting treated differently with training, going to summer and Christmas events.

Really bad career progression.

Manager hasnt really bothered taking time hiring quality staff.

Zero experience staff joining the company at higher rank and higher salary
Advice to Management
Its really bad to see staff members been put through there paces to apply for promotion or managerial role only to find someone with no training experience, no relevant background been put forward to a higher management position. Only because they knew someone higher in the company to be put forward for the role. Dont be surprised if you see someones, friend, husband or wife join the company only because they wanted the money and not the job. This hasnt once, its happen multiple times.

Internal recruitment and HR have to put up with it and then having to give some long winded speech on why they are better then you. HR and internal recruitment are just bad people and they will fold down to upper management to decide who enters Samsung. 
Its really embarrassing and I feel bad for some of the more highly talented people I worked with to hear them say that to me. Unfortunately, nine times out of ten, they would just leave and find better jobs who respect there talent rather then who they know in the company.

Samsung can make the company better but because the work culture in some departments is basically: “No one cares what you think”. Theres no point in working in such harsh conditions.
Theres a also a bully culture at Samsung which again, why no one speaks about it? Its simple: HR doesnt care and wont do anything about it. 

Enjoy working with talentless people.

Advice to Management
If an employee has been with you 10 years but clearly is unable to perform any job, don-t promote this person to a more responsibility position, but either improve their skills or get rid of them. Also, your HR department is slow and inefficient, just like many other departments where people only hide to avoid any work and manage to get through it.

As a new employee I have found the leadership team are open, transparent and encouraging . Everyone I've met have been friendly and welcoming. It's a mature culture whereby I've been given the trust and support to suggest new things and shape my own role. There is a great learning culture with constant opportunities to upskill and grow knowledge. It's very much a multi-cultural environment which creates opportunities to collaborate from many different perspectives. The social side is great, in the short time I've been here there have been several team lunches and I hear the Christmas & summer parties are epic! We have a heavily subsidised canteen onsite that offers both western and Korean food. The pay and benefits are also very competitive so all in all it has been a great career move for me.

Well known brand for consumers. (Too bad it doesn't translate to employees or partners)
","The worst company culture I've ever experienced, seen or heard of. You will be worked to the bone. No balance at all. Ever. And forget about any onboarding, development, tools or resources. You will be provided with nothing and expected to navigate the most outrageous hurdles at the same time. 

Additionally be prepared for toxic people in the masses. Not just one or two.... most. Including leaders and HR. Everyone had been conditioned to back stab, manipulate and tear each other down. And you can't trust HR or ER to do anything about it. There has been sexual harrasment, code of conduct violations and serious discrimination especially against women. HR knows about it and brushes it off. And In some cases they even participate in it. No urgency. No concern. No action. 

Micromanagement is constant from all levels. You will be handcuffed and expected to run around like a chicken with your head cut off on the least impactful and most meaningless work. Dont expect to enjoy any PTO either. You are always on. Unless you are a low performing dirt bag. Then you will be protected and allowed to make everyone miserable with your terrible attitude all while everyone that is decent and hardworking is expected to do your work.

Everyone will try to place blame on Korea but the reality is you just have a cesspool of nasty, inept and terrible people at one place with no accountability.
Advice to Management
You need an overhaul of your HR, ER and legal department. They are TERRIBLE. They are inept. Most don't even have real HR/ER backgrounds or experience and legal is too busy covering for the misfits and the ""risk"" they might present to care about the high performing individuals. 

You can't be employee centric when the only employees you care about are low performers and despicable characters. 

Get it together Samsung.

","I read in previous reviews that the atmosphere at Samsung Staines is very toxic. Some have said that they had bad experience working with people of Indian origins. 

I don't generalize, but my experience working in a team where the majority were of Indian origin was not good. I felt there is a lot favoritism and pressure. Hindi is the main language (we're living in England). They use their mother tongue as a language of exchange, so that you don't understand. You feel you're there, but outside what is happening. A complete dilemma.

The team lead is very rude and offensive. I had to report him to the HR, but I did not do. I don't like to report. I joined the company to work and promote the business.

Finally, a European R&D should receive people with a research background. People who have validated their degree in Europe or got an equivalent of the degree they hold.
Advice to Management
Some people at the HR are also not honest. I advise the HQ or the the higher management in Staines to take a look on what is happening inside the teams. I advise the higher management also to check if the HR are not selective, discriminatory. A person there (I don't mention their name) has made my arrival very hard, leaving me without badge for 4 days. I could not access the business and I had to borrow other people's badge or wave someone to let me in.

","No respect for individuals or appreciation for work completed. Focus is always what has NOT been DONE. Time spent on projects then only to have them discarded, so time is wasted. Everything is dictated from HQ, they don't conform to the Silicon Valley ways. No working from home and there's not trust at all.
Advice to Management
If you're doing business in the Silicon Valley, then adhere to the conventions and norms that make Silicon Valley special. Bottom line, you're in the United States, not in Korea.

","This is the most unethical, unorganized, and unstable place I have ever worked at. Be prepared to work six days(12 hours)/week. This is great if you are an hourly associate since you will receive overtime pay. However, if you are salary do not expect to receive overtime pay. Supervisors are paid $12.50/hr on Saturdays. That's right $12.50/hr on Saturdays. We make less than hourly associates on Saturdays. Area Leaders make more than supervisors with all the overtime we are working. Some Area Leaders base pay is over $20/hr and $30+ with overtime. Supervisors are well underpaid (salary range $49k-$70k+) when considering the amount of time spent in the plant as well as the workload. There is a major disconnect between HR and supervisors on the production floor. We are treated like incompetent children by HR. They do not take the time to establish a professional relationship with us. The communication between HR and management here is extremely poor. There is no chain of command in the way information is delivered. Quite often the associates will receive pertinent information before the supervisor. This place is also not a safe place to work at. Safety is not a top concern to upper management. The turnover rate is alarming high. We lost at least 20 salary employees within the month of July alone. I have been working at SEHA for less than six months and I am leaving as soon as I find another job.

The working environment and tools are counter-productive and not collaborative, so you need to work more to achieve less than in a modern company (no wifi, old PCs, proprietary softwares, internet restrictions...)
They don't empower their employees (all benefits, leaves etc. are minimal) and you constantly need to get approvals for anything you do.
Lastly, if you're not Korean the ceiling glass is a reality, you won't grow any further than Manager level.

","Horrible work life balance. Never a set schedule and punished for taking PTO by having to make up days missed once you return. Field sales managers feel like retail employees based on leadership directives, which constantly change by the week. None of which helps with our never ending schedule changes mid cadence which ruins our executive presence in-store. no one really gets reimbursed for mileage so in turn, our car's need heavy maintenance for only about $5-$10 back in return a week for gas. I could go on but all in all, I'm still with the company (for now) so until a better opportunity that's financially rewarding with good enough benefits presents itself, I will reluctantly remain an FSM.
Advice to Management
Listen to your field team. In sourcing your employees isn't a ""reward"" it's a privilege for you and us all. It grants you the peace of mind knowing we will be out there doing SEA proud with integrity, not for you to work us to the bone until we lose pride in what we do. Respect that we have families and want time with our loved ones on major holidays like Thanksgiving. Please stop rubbing that we're all ""One Samsung"" and in sourced in our face every chance you get. It makes us want to quit and walk away for thinking you did us all a favor. I once loved my job but am now feeling depleted and unappreciated.

","What an awful place to work. There is a serious lack of management - senior management is generally Korean and therefore there is a big language barrier. Majority of these managers have gained their positions due to their nationality and not their skills, qualifications or experience. You find yourself making most (if not all) of the big decisions on behalf of management. It really is the blind leading the blind. 

You will struggle to gain any recognition or growth unless you are Korean. 

It is a company that operates very much like a small business yet it is a multinational company?! There is no structure whatsoever. No building maintenance, guidelines, processes or training. Actually, you do get training, but on how to address Korean people (not how to use Samsung’s systems etc.) - and that’s only if you are permanent! 

No ability to work from home - in fact you can’t even use a USB stick without permission from HQ. It really is an absurd place to work. 

Samsung’s staff turnover is shockingly high - for a reason! 

In my time there I never once had any discussions about future development, progression etc. It’s like you get a position and you’re stuck there for life.
Advice to Management
- Invest in qualified management
- invest in training for your employees
- look at what other multinational companies are doing to retain their staff

","Lack of communication between departments, which often resulted in misunderstanding and contradictory decisions.

Toxic office politics, one of the worst working environment if ever experienced, I wouldn't have been able to stay for 3 years if I weren't working remotely.

Too many people in the management roles, not enough people who actually do work.

Many people are not capable of performing their jobs, the lack of knowledge plagues the company.

These are the 3 main things that generates unnecessary chaos and stress, and it is not a healthy work environment at all.

No help, no work, no direction.
They want to do everything but halfway through will cancel everything and by the year end review asked you why haven't you achieve anything
Big bosses barely works, they just show face then throw all the work to the low ranking staff to figure out all the hard work.

If you're lucky, you'll have a good supervisor or manager who will protect you from all the negativities in the company.
","No room to move up. All the higher positions are given to Korean expats.
Can't participate in some meetings as they are in Korean.
Long work hours. More than 8 hours of work each day (around 10 to 12 hours of work) and they expect you to finish everything every day but they will question you if you apply for OT too much and then be blamed if you fall behind. So you end up working extra hours for free if you want to catch up with work.
Orientation talks about how Samsung Values its people and its corporate responsibility. But reality is different. There are managers/executives that shout and yell at employees as if we were in the Middle Ages. And even if the employees complain to HR, the company does not do anything about it as they would rather keep the executive than the lowly employee. Thus, good employees just give up and either stay and be miserable, or resign to preserve their health, or find work with another company.
Advice to Management
Start applying the Samsung Values and truly value your people.

","Top brass Koreans have absolutely no respect for locals, not even for their own people, they do not trust anyone, their disrespectful military style goes against moral and self-esteem, and creating employee fear is management number one job. Even if you are in an urgent need for a job, do not accept any offer, you will regret afterward, or you will get fired. Attrition is very high and not even justifies the need for a learning opportunity. Poor work-life balance, employees can't comment or speak, just obey, no autonomy to take any decision, just follow orders, Koreans just want robots working for them. HH RR department ignores local country labor laws, and they walk a very thin line while trying to comply with minimum standards, they are just an instrument of senior management to blackmail employees, who must get things done or get fired.
You have a long way to learn respect for your employees. I'm not writing this review to attack Samsung, neither expecting any kind of apology. I´m writing this review to advise anyone wishing to work for Samsung, not to make such a huge mistake as I did, my life was miserable there.

- Projects create great impact given Samsung has such a huge consumer base
","- Teams do not have good synergy. Few teams often work on the same projects. Teams do not support other teams as they don't want others to get credit.
- Most freshers do not have proper mentors as the management is not technically strong. Senior people have been in the organisation for a long time and are trained more in the politics rather than the technical capabilities.

2018-12-16, Field Sales Manager,,Current Employee,PLEASE address morale of the field team,"Used to be a great job with a lot flexibility. Those days are toast.
","I don't know who is dictating the schedule of the field team, but it's gone from bad to worse. Used to be a Mon-Fri job. It was awesome. Now, who the eff knows. We get sent out a schedule a week before it starts for the month. Working company holidays, 8 DAYS IN A ROW over Thanksgiving...for no other reason than this greedy company trying to push a few more boxes. The team is miserable, doesn't have 2 days off in a row...I could go on. This has gone from a territory management role to a retail micromanaged position. Don't you dare have more than 3 pieces of swag on your table during table days, or try to spend time with your family on weekends. I'm sure after S10 launches, they will see a TON of turnover. All the good ones are leaving and upper management doesn't give a damn. Oh, and you will only be promoted if you came from the best buy side....a failing program.
Advice to Management
Open your eyes & ears, you're destroying what was a great team. Lift the blackouts ( 7 months out of the year) and kill the weekend work... it's NOT working. Have a flex schedule. ASK for REAL feedback from the team. We are NOT retail employees.

","All the strategic direction and decisions come from the Korean headquarters; and unless you are Korean, you are treated like a second-class citizen and your ideas and contributions are not be valued. There is very little transparency and sharing of information within the company. They have no idea how to “collaborate” or “innovate”. Majority of senior executives are from Korea and they are quite rude, disrespectful and raise their voices. HR is unable to shift the culture of the company so that a company that has offices and presence in the US adheres to US values and professionalism in the workplace. Women especially are treated badly as Koreans are quite chauvinistic and expect everyone to bow to them - literally. Despite its new building in San Jose, Samsung is a rotten company!

You can't run the company as though you are still in Korea. Need to learn and understand the US corporate culture and adapt.

Advice to Management
Pay attention to opinions of employees, respect all employees, not only the ones on high positions, give chance to employees to grow professionally, to transfer from one subsidiary to another, be open to different views than your own opinion and perspective.

There are no SOP's in place, just however they decide to do it and beat you over the head with it. By this I mean extreme micromanaging to the point they count how many times you have to use the restroom. Most extreme case of mistrust I have ever encountered in my career.

When management fosters an attitude of 100% control what is the point in constantly hiring people, they will all find other jobs because this is not a good environment.

","Aggressive behaviour by management in B2B team, director has no strategy and knee jerks to pressure from above as well as managing down rather than up. Toxic environment. Try and avoid paying commission in B2B by hiking targets as soon as an opportunity is mentioned. SFDC has become the CRM but not properly implemented so requires hours of work each week. Big discrepancy between what is required in pay plan and what leadership want. Culture of panic.

","Horrible management. Many Korean managers have been there for a long time. Due to being pigeon-holed in a unique environment,their skill sets became narrow and therefore make them not employable elsewhere. This has caused them to feel insecure, paranoid and jealous of other younger employees whom they think might outshine them. Lack of flexibility in the environment. Unecessarily hierarchical and the obsession with attention to detail wears staff out.

Being paranoid and gossiping about your employees will only drive people out the door faster. Please start treating people like they are human beings.

","There are some teams that you will have few chances to learn or grow in your career. The evaluation performance process is horrible and forces managers to apply bad scores for good workers.

In general, they are not transparent and many policies for employees are unclear.

You are somewhat treated as special in a Korean team, like a guess. The problems are interesting and you will have opportunity to learn new things.
","You will experience severe isolation, you will likely be treated as a contractor and provided with absolute minimal context or background information. Koreans often don't seem to want to hand you significant responsibility. Due to hierarchy and fierce internal politics, managers often don't listen to feedback. Opportunity for promotion into higher management is rare. If you are employed as a senior, principal or master engineer, don't expect them to give you people to manage. Unless for example you are an Indian and they are looking for someone to manage people in India. The problems often have unrealistic goals and fairly few works make their way into products.

","Outdated technology - got a used laptop that was pretty slow and ran on Win 7 (yes, in 2018). Got a used phone and was told that if I wanted headphones, they could disinfect a pair for me. 
The attitude of the managers was really bad - even with little experience, they were not open to make things (or themselves) better, even if the people they had on their teams had a lot more work experience. 
Micromanaging was the law and it cost a lot of people their efficiency and productiveness. 
Was promised a ‘flexible’ work schedule, but was actually forced to work 9 to 5 in the end.
Not doing overtime was frowned upon, even if you’d finished your duties for the day. 
Hiring overqualified people for the wrong jobs - or promising things in the interviews that are not happening.
Not allowing workers to move between teams if that is what they want.

4. Only maintenance project are running . Everyone needs to demonstrate some POcs without knowledge of current technology . These Pocs will go in dustbin after demo to MD (MD joined SRI-D to retire , obviously he does not have any interest in any kind technology ). 
5. Your MBO will be decided based on some stupid activity like singing , making stupid model in yearly event and based on stupid test . 
6. Seniors are working on project and getting lower salary than Freshers (for playing Chess and sleeping ). Every time you will regret yourself why you were not able clear JEE in your 20s. 
7. It is true that they are not firing , but at one fine day they will ask you to leave the organisation and your life will be ruined . 
8. There is one department B2B , where you will find your career ruined as they ask you to connect wires on TV and share log with developer .

","The worst systems I have ever used in my life. CRM system over 30 years old. Some departments trying to operate as a contact centre but does not have adequate technology for staff to do the best job they can. Working off only one screen from a laptop that is over 8 years old (Samsung don't make laptops anymore) This is the worst company I have ever worked for. Being a technology company I was so surprised by the archaic systems and processes used.

Spend some money on decent technology which will overall improve customer experience.

Provide staff with reasonably fast computers with two screens and upgrade the 30 year old SAP CRM system. Implement a proper soft phone system which will benefit the business also in terms of insights and reporting.

- Well structured SCM, Marketing assets
Cons

- Not clear ""Pricing Strategy"" creates unnecessary price erosion.
Advice to Management
- Samsung have grown up with advanced leadership on technology and super effective hardware manufacturaing ability until now, however when Chinese Brands are copying Samsung's fast follower strategy and it's threathening Samsung's current crown, we must take a step to make Samsung Brand into True Premium.

We must stop doing the ""wrong pricing strategy"", ""burning money into non-brand building activities"".
We should value the Brand, and set ""sell out action policies"", ""right pricing strategy"", ""consumer need oriented product development""

Samsung still have good Brand and great technology leadership, if samsung is able to implement ""Brand"" and ""Right Pricing Strategy"", samsung can be unbeatable champ in the market.

They pay extremely well and have two rounds of performance bonus in a year. Overall more cash oriented versus total benefits.
Cons
Culture needs a LOT of work. It's not behaving like a Global/multinational company. It's essentially a Korean company with a global footprint. That says a lot. Korean leaders are considered gods -- and behave as such. Cross them once and you will be marked forever - i.e. subjective performance reviews, delays in promotion, limited exposure.

Furthermore, it's a very sales-oriented organisation at the core -- in contrast to being marketing-oriented as for other global consumer brand companies. That being said, classically-trained brand marketing professionals will not find fulfilment or recognition here as they are seen only as campaign execution drivers rather than drivers of overall brand and business strategy.

There's also no real Global Mobility program. You may get assigned to a 6month stint at HQ -- but it's very poorly planned, as you will practically do nothing, and understand nothing coz they all speak only Korean in meetings. Go figure.

","Terrible systems and processes - For some reason Samsung has decided to make the operational work environment as inefficient as possible. So many approvals, rudimentary reporting capability and unwieldy systems to navigate (as dictated by HQ).

Senior management is fairly toxic in many teams (especially those coming from Korea). The strict hierarchical nature of the org structure makes two way communication (up and down) very difficult which affects the corporate agility

* Non-trust culture: Everyone suspects everyone else
* No space for technical grow: if you want to take a training, that is NOT included in your worktime. That's ridiculous in a fast-pace muting world.
* If you work as a Software Engineer, you have to take some incredibly messed internal algorithm proficiency certifications in C or Java, not recognised anywhere else of course
* Internal portals are like labirints, impossible to understand. Some work only on Windows. Some may prompt js popups in Korean and kill your browser entirely.
* Bureaucracy for anything that's easy, i.e. if you need a headphone see you must ask 10 approvals, with a chain of command going upto almost the company CEO.

2018-04-09, Technical Lead,Bangalore,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",Great Place to Work,"Some of the best guys to work with and a lot of cool stuff happening. Work is technically challenging. Have learnt a lot here. 

Cabs and Bus Facilities are available. Breakfast, lunch and dinner are available at subsidised rates. Gym facility is available. 

Good Compensation. There is a variable part but it is paid out in full usually.

Patents are encouraged. Open Culture. 

Team members are sent to South Korea on project assignments for short and long term both. Majorly short term.
","Many of the design decisions are driven by South Korean Team. We do have a say but it gets overridden .

Samsung pricing model needs to change. Companies like Redmi, Moto, Lenovo have completely taken monopoly of the Indian Mobile Phone market because of their aggressive pricing strategies and the ability to provide quality handsets at a very cheap price.

Policy of Hiring only from IIT's / Premier Institutes. In my opinion, this is actually a discrimination. A lot of talented people are from non premier institutes. Samsung had a period where they took candidates from non premier institutes as well but it was very brief and then it stopped. I do not know if they have started hiring candidates from non premier institutes again.

They do not provide laptops because of security concerns so the option of WFH is ruled out. 

They have their own internal mailbox for sending emails. It is not good and is a pain to use. They should probably use Outlook or something similar. Not sure of the reasoning behind this.
Advice to Management
Please change your pricing model. Unless this is done, you will not be able to regain your spot in the Indian Mobile Segment. 

WFH option should be provided. Samsung should do something about this.

Keep hiring people from non premier institues. IMHO, when a person is talented enough, it should not matter where he has studied.

Create longer term placements for senior management (Management try and maximise short term gains, instead of seeing the bigger picture). Create more cohesion between departments, allowing for goals which are company focused, instead of product/division focused. Lastly human capital is your most valuable asset, both Korean and European talent, reflect this in how you treat people.

the salary is really competitive versus other global companies i worked
- it will be very easy to get a job after you get few year experience in Samsung
- if you are not married and don't have children, money and career matters to you more than human values and people around you, this is THE place
","- people imitate there is a lot of work as they want to show how important they are, in reality i could make all the job quickly and had to imitate i work the rest of the time - it is devastating. they really pay attention to your computer screen and you're afraid your facebook even that it can be related to work.
- check in and check out system - 5min late to work and you have to explain why to vice president or HR
- you can't go home earlier, people sit until 18.00 or 17.00 even that they are done
- because of high salaries your colleagues will be ready for everything in order to keep the job - they will tell things behind your back to top management, even though these things have nothing to do with reality, they will not help you with some very specific things in your 3 month period and become more friendly after they understand that you stay, they will be very inhuman, untrue, career oriented robots
-and, yes, non asians will be treated like monkeys. there are rules for koreans and rules for ordinary people
- your korean boss will be betraying you on the meeting to make his career, he will be very unhuman and make you feel under psychological pressure
- be ready that they will test you and come at your table by asking market share of certain product on certain market or something like that - employees really learn KPIs, it doesn't help them making the right decisions, but just answer the korean tests

i will never buy Samsung products, as they are built on the bones of people, from who this corporation sucks out blood with this awful robot-like corporate culture
- they will ask you to work on weekends and spends evenings on business lunches, it's really too much there - they absolutely ignore your private life schedule

Red tape everywhere 
Now matter what level you are, you are just executing
You won’t get far here unless you are Korean
Also they tend to prefer to hire Koreans 
HR does not care if management abuses you and turns the other cheek 
Everyone is stressed and miserable

Benefits
Subpar medical benefits
2 weeks of maternity leave
Medical leave is shady parameters 
Politically- right leaning 
Perks are terrible - it takes months to get the friends and family discounts for the devices and when you do- you get better deals on amazon. 
If you are lucky to get vacation approval from management
Advice to Management
Stop abusing your employees 
For a Tech company you are terribly behind the benefits and perks of your competitors.
Your reputation in the industry is terrible for a reason

","Very Korean style of management, many things have to go through your Korean expat and many reports to be done in the Korean formats. Many Korean documents in which some might not make sense to apply to local context. Expect long hours. Some CEO you work with will be good, some are just down for business results neglecting the people aspect.

","This company lures foreign recruits to come work at their Korea HQ with competitive salaries. Unfortunately, they do not tell you that there is a double standard for performance evaluations. They never communicated this ahead of time. There was no transparency at all. Foreigners are evaluated at a higher standard because of their higher incomes. You want to hold foreigners at higher standard because of their higher pay? then give them a higher position that would be aligned with their salary so that they can deliver on higher expectations. This is discriminatory. Their bait and switch practice is very questionable and incredibly unfair
Advice to Management
Stop discriminatory practices against foreing hires. You should get rid of the bell curve that you promised to get rid of two years ago. Promote a meritocracy based promotion system rather than the seniority based legacy system that still exists today. You should conduct full 360 evaluations with more than 4 stakeholders evaluating people rather that the current 2 evaluator system which really is a one evaluator system (everybody knows this)

Depending on the sales, good compensation.
Looks good on the resume. And after working in such a high pressure workplace, nothing else seem terribly difficult.
","No work-life balance. Koreans are expected to sit around in their desk until their seniors leave work. And they usually work until 8-10pm. When busy, easily passed midnight. High work ethics but no efficiency at work. Expected to be ready to come to work, get on the messenger or answer your phone even in the week-end. Everything's 'emergency'.
Always worked in fear. Higher managers are always extremely stressed under lots of pressure. Managers don't know how to manage people. The whole company needs a serious change in work culture.

","Contemplating a career here, or know someone who is? 
Point them to these reviews. Save yourself or that person, unless you dislike them!

Turnover is very high because training is non-existent.

Pay is low and likely to remain that way.

Samsung uses legacy technology to solve tomorrow's problems... except the deadline passed yesterday.

The WEBSITE CMS is a botched AEM implementation. HQ is stonewalling to 'save face'.

Bullying and harassment is rife in SERVICE division. 

Attempts to bring in Fair Work Australia have been foiled, most notably in 2014.
I can confidently say Pauline Hanson will devour a ""halal snack pack"" before that happens. 
 
Some companies dream of heading into space by 2020, like Virgin Galactic. And P0rnhub.
Samsung dreams of ""Work Smart 2020 - Building a Creative Culture: Work Smart. Think Hard. Build Trust.""
A closer description is: Hard Culture. Build Work. Group Think.
 
All this leads to an inevitable truth. We haemorrhage talent.

2017-08-26, Software Engineer,Bangalore,"Current Employee, less than 1 year",Poor HR Policies,"Decent Compensation
Lot of Technologies to work on if given a chance
Free and decent food (have to pay for snacks)
If one performs well in their competency test, he/she is very valued and given a choice to choose any team
Some teams are really good with very competent people who really care about career growth of a fresher(I was fortunate to get into one such team)
","Extremely poor HR policies. One example is that when college freshers join, their teams are decided by HR as compared to the people working in the teams themselves

There is a retention bonus policy, wherein one has to work for atleast 3 years to get the assured package, otherwise have to return the retention bonus part of the salary, which is almost 30% of the total annual compensation .

Extremely tight security. Cant take laptops out of office. Cant bring anything like usb, ipod, etc inside. Hence, can't work from home.

No wifi in office. Even the ethernet speed is very poor(~10 Mbps)

Lot of disparity in compensation and general behavior between IITians and non-ITians.

Work life balance in most of the teams is poor. 

HQ in Korea makes all the decisions. No ownership of any project, except some really bad projects who don't have any commercial value.

Some teams are called to work in weekends, while other teams hardly work half the time they are in office.

No recreation in office, other than a Foosball table and two tt tables for ~5k employees .

Greatly affected and influenced by Samsung Group - You cannot do what you want.
Admin staffs always reign over engineers (You must feel disrespected)
Advice to Management
Samsung construction used to be a very good company. They build top 3 world skyscrapers, incheon and yeongjong bridge. No such projects since then - for 10 years. Now we cannot say we're good and experienced. Please change CEO (Chi Choi) who knows business and who is willing to do business. If you don't want construction business, just sell it, not making people withered.

PS- those are actually not a pros, but still :)

IIT - first cadre - irrespective of what they are doing- preparing for MS, MBA , they will be paid enough and given authority.
NIT - second cadre - same as IIT , difference can be observed meticulously

","If it really does exist the concept of circus in a company, you can find it at Cheil Industries. No job descriptions, no roles, only lies. Today you can be a manager and tomorrow you will be used as a warehouseman, independently from your background and expertise. Don't hope to make a career there inside, unless you are Korean. The biggest risk is to forget how to work, as there inside you just play something unintellegible. There is a huge difference of salary treatment among Korean people and other ethnicities' ones. They will try with all their efforts to keep some money from your settlement, when you leave, as they consider a shame the fact that you're leaving this company and they will get offended like children. It is strong their attempt to make you think as a Korean, as they don't want to accept that they're working in a foreign country. The management is composed by people that don't even know their name, nor why they've been put there.

2017-02-25, Senior Product Manager,"Suwŏn, Kyonggi, Kyonggi","Current Employee, more than 3 years",Full-time chaos,"Global reach. Mega brand which can get you a meeting with almost anyone. Chance to see/develop some cutting-edge new technologies if you are so lucky. As a foreigner at Korea HQ, you may be thrust into a role which gives you a chance to see the world through business trips. 3 free meals a day at the cafeteria and free shuttle bus transportation to/from work.
","Initiatives and executives come and go at the blink of an eye. Poorly-defined roles & responsibilities for most employees -- this ambiguity causes a lot of project overlap among groups and you often find 2 groups working on the same project simultaneously, unbeknownst to each other. Excessive politicking. Little collaboration between groups. Still a very strong Korean hierarchy and junior level employees don't take personal initiative or accept accountability. Important meetings are held in Korean language and as a foreigner you get left out -- unless you have somehow mastered the language on your own time as Samsung does not provide Korean classes for its foreign employees (you do receive a budget for education but no clear way to use this effectively while working a full-time job). No flexibility at all to work outside the office, and your hours are tracked; i.e. you must sit at your desk for 9 hours/day even if you have nothing to do!
Advice to Management
Where to start??? Two tips for managing foreign employees at Korea HQ... (1) Clearly define roles for foreign employees before they start work, and clearly define objectives which they will be measured against. (2) Either establish a policy to communicate in English when foreign employees are present, or provide intensive Korean-language education on campus during work hours so foreign employees can contribute productively and not be left out of important discussions.

-Cafeteria food (while it can get sorta boring) is actually quite good. well for free food.
","Possibly the worst decision ever in my professional career. I was an experienced expat hire having previously worked for other top companies (APPLE, MSFT, GOOGLE...take your pick). Worked for Samsung Mobile marketing...you know the group that puts those dog and pony shows with Korean executives speaking with their poorly spoken English. This place will absolutely rot your soul. You will wonder every day of your stringent 1.5 or 2 year contract, what you are doing there; why you are there; and how to kill time. Every minute of your mandatory 10 hour days (yes, they track your hours and you will get an incomplete if you do not put in your full 10 hours). Yes, you have to go through an airport security system and put your bags through an X-ray machine. i could go on and on. But the most important point is that as a professional hire, you will regress. While you are rotting away in Suwon with absolutely nothing to do, your colleagues back home will be moving up progressively or have worked on something amazing. For more details please check out a book called Noonchi: The Appearance of Working in a South Korean Chaebol for the painful details. Yes, a former employee wrote a tell-all expose because it was the only way to keep sane.

This must also be one of the worst places to work as a woman. No female role models in senior grades at all and I heard outright sexist remarks by colleagues on several occassions.
Advice to Management
Work to overhaul the business culture completely. You have a great opportunity to combine the strengths of both east asian and western working culture. This would make Samsung a much better place to work and no doubt improve performance.
