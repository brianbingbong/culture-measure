2016-01-25,Anonymous,Taipei,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",Tough but Rewarding,"Great opportunity for rapid career advancement if you are willing to make sacrifices. As long as you find a good department/superior, your hard work will not go unnoticed and it will be rewarded in the form of generous bonuses/stock options.
","Despite being one of the largest corporations in the world, there are still quite a few managers/departments that rely on dated/inefficient management styles. Getting with the right team is key. Also, if you plan to work in China, then proficiency in Chinese basically is a must.
Advice to Management

2. Get in touch with tier 1 suppliers in the field.
3. Company provide stocks to the employee with good performance.
","1. Traditional knowledge of MBA doesn't work here. There is no room for you to prepare it in advance. It's all about how do you adjust your pace to match with the company.
2. Discipline is the basis of factory. 
3. The personal creative idea will be hard to implement since each department has no sufficient room to bet their KPI on uncertain image.
