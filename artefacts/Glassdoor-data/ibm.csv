Pros
For now, I'm working in home office (I don't have to take transport), is a relaxing job, for the same cuestion and the things I do, attending service request is something like... help other people with a little problems that they have and something else.
Cons
Is something ironic, home office is a double edged sword, is a pro and cons in determinated situations, and this case is for concentration. Another cons... agghh... is SAP, trust me when I'm telling you that software is obsolet, is the worst... outside have better facturation softwares and still we using that... and the documentation is almost obsolet too, my capacitation depends of other comrades and determinated situations, 
I depend of they for do the job (of course, in the beggining)

Business Outlook
Pros
*Mostly competent people I've worked with from different backgrounds and age ranges.
*Very good tools (W3 portal) one-stop shop for all HR/Expenses/Appraisal/Tech support needs 
*Excellent learning culture where IBM will sponsor your certifications for free and even reward you for passing them. Free Udemy and SAP Learning Hub access.
*Flexible work from home arrangement.
*In the pandemic we have received some food reimbursements and an internet allowance.
Cons
*Some projects give incentives if you did a great job. Otherwise the salary is mostly stagnant.
*The org structure is already very lean (minimal managers / lead positions), 1 project manager with direct reports, for example - so the chances of being promoted vertically (with a paygrade increase) is very slim.
Advice to Management
*Revisit the salary and benefits of your employees and re-align it with the industry.

","Absolutely all things claimed to be done by Silicone Valley will be summarily implemented regardless of whether they apply to the specific situation. You'll spend much more time on compliance than productive work. Pay is at the lower end of what you could get. No raises or bonuses. Health insurance is more costly than average, barely less than hourly contract workers. HR will not share this publicly because it is so bad. They have an agile environment, you might find yourself like an ancient Egyptian slave building a useless pyramid under the whip of some under-educated ""scrum master"" who can barely turn on a computer.

Business Outlook
Pros
1. They promised a lot of different things when you are hired
2. Pay is ok but only for the very first time
3. You will be getting a lot of e-mail from senior management with absolutely the same mantra - ""We appreciate a lot that you do for IBM"", ""Without you, IBM is nothing"" etc. But as stated below - there is nothing but a pure lie to keep the motivation of employees
Cons
An unexpectedly huge number of conses which is absolute nonsense for such a company like IBM:
1. Hire to fire mentality. That is ridiculous but you are hired only for a short period of time (and you'll be fired right after the project will ended). Nobody cares about your next assignment - neither your manager nor anyone at IBM - you are the only one responsible for finding a project (and you will see a constant punishment from different management). It results in the pre-sales activities that you must do, which contradicts what IBM promised you to do.
2. A lot of departments with noble names (Cloud innovation, etc.), with a lot of management, which does nothing. Departments just tried to find their own client and do everything the client requested - no matter what kind of activities it might be - from the solution development to the pure business consultancy. So nobody cares about what project you would like to be engaged in - you will work otherwise you'll be fired.
3. Salary raise. Just forget about it - it happens bizarrely rare. For instance, people working for IBM did not have a raise for about 3 or 4 years even though got an upper level of performance.
4. People. Most of your colleagues - as worked under a punishment - have treats you wouldnt' like. They might be lying, arrogant, lazy, they don't care about other people's problems. That is the real IBM 'soul'


All that just lead to enormous frustration and burnout, you cannot have plans for your employment more than for the period of the project are working for..

As a technical person - I extremely do not recommend that place. It is worse than any outsourcing company.
Advice to Management
The only advice is to completely transform yourself into the software development company and fire all of the middle management, transforming the team to agile. 
The company that fires experts instead of management - is sick and will die in any case.

Expect significant layoffs and budget cuts every other year. Marketing platforms are poorly implemented and not ready for prime time. Requirements are being defined by people with limited to no experience. It’s a big mess.
Advice to Management
Stop with the fake rah rah and do something about the horrible culture . No one is happy and most are afraid or getting laid off or are just working to add something to their resume when they jump ship to their next role outside the company.

Good place to gain insight into the business side of software contract work.
Good position to add to your resume.
","I can break down the cons of my experience at IBM CIC Baton Rouge into 3 categories: 1. Pay 2. Management. 3. Projects 

1. The pay at the Baton Rouge CIC is low comparatively and relatively. I personally worked there for ~3 years, and was still earning under $50k annually as a developer. 

 2. Management is out of touch with the developers. When things don’t go as planned, management fails to take ownership over developers. Overall, management doesn’t care about developers. They only seem to care about developers charging hours to a project so they meet their numbers. These, among other, managerial issues are deeply rooted in the CIC. I have seen similar issues brought up to upper management, and sadly, little or nothing is done to address the issue's root cause. Instead management’s usual solution is to throw the CIC a pizza party or send you cookies to show you that they “care”.

3. I worked on 6 different projects while at the CIC, and only 2 of the 6 were quality. One of the “projects” I was assigned was for RI Dept of Health working as a call center operator scheduling covid tests for kids and teachers. Overall quality of projects is not great.

Leadership and colleagues are in general friendly
","Top is laden with politics - I've seen two types of leaders: 
1. people who rise to the top because they are great leaders 
2. people who rise to the top because they have great relationships (but are not great leaders at all) 
Unfortunately type 2 has been much more common at IBM 
As a result, young, ambitious folks who work a lot, who are fully capable, often face a ""glass-ceiling"" at this company as they lack the sponsors/relationships

2021-09-20, Resource Manager,Heredia,"Current Employee, more than 5 years",Good training grounds,"A formidable training ground as there is aridiculous amount of traininng options through internal platforms and lots of potential coaches very open to share their expertise. Great cross cultural exchange as you work with people from literllaly all over the world. Very good benefits plan.
","A bit too bureaucratic for my taste. Focus is not truly on performance but mostly on measurements and reaching specific indicators for the area. Changing roles is quite a challenge and there is a lot of push back from the business unit to let go of a practitioner to another area (two examples: one person had to negotiate for over 1 year and essentially stop doing her job to be allowed to move to another role, another made 3 attempts where she was told that there was no problem with moving, but had to wait 6 months to do so). 
Locally, management still needs development; in my personal experience, feedback from management was, with 2 exceptions (noting that I reported to 6 different managers in a little over a year), simplistic, sometimes recycled and never clear on which gaps needed improvement to further advance your career. Managers in general tend to be too nice and try to avoid making you feel bad rather than challenging you to become a better professional.
Advice to Management
Pay more attention to what your team members are saying and focus less on their numbers when discussing development. And get to the point without so much fuss.

","Old style management, people who have been stuck in IBM for 20 years and are taking decisions due to politics instead of results. There is no incentive to be good. No bonuses, hardly any stocks. And if you succeed you become an enemy of others who try to fight your success, so it doesnt pay to be succesfull... just be mediocre and you would be fine.

High on diversity. Free online learning course. You will learn to stay relevant and competitive in a fast paced environment.
","Expect very seldom career growth opportunity. Be ready to accept more work and responsibility. Extended or long hours of work is a norm. You will experience many critical work days/periods in which you will not be able to take vacation leave. Best of luck if they happen to fall on an important family occasion. Senior management are usually too busy they can't schedule a decent or quality time for one on one meeting. If they do manage to schedule one, good luck on feeling the sincerity because more often it becomes robotic or routinely for compliance. Out of 10 managers I have experienced on my entire career only 2 managers which was during my early years were able to show sincerity and genuine concern about me as an employee and my career development. Over the years, I have seen how the work culture declined. What was once a happy, sharing of best practices and helping each other type of work environment became a highly competitive one. People became focused on job security because of the rampant and aggressive company or business operation changes. My advise is to check back after 2-3 years when they are probably more stable.

Teaming, International cooperation, and cultural acceptance made for great experiences.
Process centric taught me a great deal about business and best practices methodologies.
","No salary increases for years combined with increasing work demand was a real spirit breaker.
Increasingly difficult to get promotions regardless of physical performance as it was standard practice to lower performance ratings when there was no budget for raises or rewards. 
IBM is very strategic about what they offer in severance packages to ensure a reduced media coverage by fewer complainers. 
IBM is known to not favor senior staffers. Why pay someone $145k, when they can help you out the door and immediately hire a college intern that has no practical business skills for far less.
Advice to Management
Speak less of the harnessing of skills from senior staff when you actually prefer to allow the bean counters to trim he expenses and worry about expertise after the fact. Yes this is what impacted me, but at the same time for years prior, I saw this happen to colleagues all the time. I should have left earlier for opportunities with competitors to help put you in your place.

","Very old tools to work with, for a Tech company is very impressive how they work with tools that are so inefficient, breaking every moment.
No training AT ALL, you need to struggle yourself and discover on your own what are your tasks to do, how to use the tools, EVERYTHING!
People seem to be so unmotivated, being in the same position for MANY years and not looking to move at all, it is like they are just zombies working there.

Pros
Easy work, reasonable hours, pay is OK given hours
Cons
It's pretty much what you would expect from your assumptions of IBM. Work is dull, management are dull and very few people actual like working there. The graduate program is terrible, the only meaningful difference between being a graduate and not seems to be that you have three two-day training session which are a complete waste of time. Nobody really cares about your development, the only aim of management seems to be to get your utilisation numbers high. Even if this means staffing you on projects where you are not needed. 

If you are lucky you may find interesting work as it is a big company, however, the experience of myself and the vast majority of my peers was that the work is poor, development opportunities are poor, and you will spend a significant proportion of your time quite bored.

2021-09-17,Anonymous,"Manila, Manila, Manila","Former Employee, more than 1 year",A very good experience,"They provide a decent salary for entry level. I had a very good experience with this company. All people are nice and professional. Knowing I was just a fresh graduate when I worked there, they believed my capabilities and supported me all throughout my journey. My team helped me build my confidence and thought me so much values that would make me mature and professional just like them. I'll missed the atmosphere and culture that might be difficult to find in other companies. As for the job, I was challenged and overwhelmed at first because I had to learn many systems and tools. But I get eventually used to it. Even I find it somehow routinary but I enjoyed working with the process. I thank this company for believing in me and the trust they bestowed in me.
","This company thrives in innovation. There's no way you should stay on what is permanent because they change everything in a short matter of time. Too bad when I already learned a process or work, I will pour my heart on that job and perform the best I can be on that process. Also, I am introvert and I prefer to keep everything as silo as it could be but I guess almost all corporation has this culture of collaboration and negotiation which I do not possess. I also felt the company values are not aligned with mine so I eventually get depressed and sad when I wake up everyday and not so excited to log in knowing my day will have so much meetings left and right. Not to mention extending my time because I had to meet our counterparts from different timezones so work-life balance is somehow compromised.
Advice to Management
I find it odd sometimes when you always try to change something even if there's nothing to be changed. I always try not to invalidate the great things you've done to the world. People will always be thankful for those. But based on my experience at IBM, I find your culture of innovation somehow superficial and just a 'decoration' since I observed that you've been pressured by your competitors in the tech industry. And so you're hurrying to innovate on something, change on something, create this company, and this and that... But I would like to tell you from the very bottom of my heart.. you have the power to make job market a dynamic and harmonious one than empowering only your industry/area of specialization. There are people who do not care in material gains and status just like me. But I guess since IBM is an American company so the culture of competition and superflous idea of recognition are there. I am just an average middle income guy whose become a failure of the system I can't able to adapt. But the system also forgot to cater to people of different values and principles because they neglect to align that with their system. I hope you find it in your heart how the most silo and introverted people in the world can make a difference if your system open their arms for these kind of people.

Pros
IBM is no longer the uptight blue suit wearing company of the past. I expected a far more rigidly managed culture of conformity but what I have experienced is rather open, friendly and relaxed. Ability to apply your subject matter expertise with a great amount of autonomy while working with clients if excellent for experienced professionals.
Cons
Administrative processes take the concept of employee self-service to the extreme. Many internal systems are old, overengineered and occasionally just don't work at all. It can be both difficult and frustrating to find a human to help. With all that said the biggest Con of working for IBM is the email and scheduling platform (Lotus Notes or something called Verse). Outlook, Gmail or really anything else would be more effective and efficient. Its really that bad.
Advice to Management
Let go of Notes and Verse. Really anything else would be more effective and efficient.

Advice to Management
Appreciation is a good culture but if people are not growing, they tend to leave the company. A loss if IBM experience and skill-set can not make good to the company. Please don't always blindly depend on people managers.

Good solid training that sets you up really well for a career elsewhere
Good exposure to clients and new projects. Strategy is fun if you have a good partner at the helm of the RFP.
Cons
Culture is toxic & predatory. Diversity is a joke. The hours are long which I didn't mind but I can understand that this is not everyone's cup of tea, so you find yourself picking up the slack for others. The internal processes are mind-boggling time-consuming. The penalties for not doing each process are severe for what is essentially low-value red tape.

- Missaligned incentives drive associate partners and partners in purely sales driven roles impacting their development and the quality of the projects IBM delivers 
- Hardly any indsutry expertise making it hard for IBM to solve client problems that matter
- Poor prospects for technically focused individuals as incentive scheme sadly does not reward technical excellence
Advice to Management
- Align incentive scheme with your client's objectives 
- Hire senior staff with hard skills

","Poor management in GBS
They provide laptop and ask us to lock inside Office Premises then why a portable device is provided? 

There was a situation where management told us ""You can be scientist or excellent engineer but here you must do what we ask to do"". 

HR and managers are same person so it is difficult to reach HR in case of any issues. 
Lot of politics happen as HRs support only managers. 
I have seen pure politics and people literally suffered. 
Having laptop in hand, management expects people to work whenever it is asked. They expect to be logged in 24 / 7. 
They used Whatsapp as official chat and impacted personal life of so many people. 
These are the cons in my experience with IBM.

Extremely insulting. Learning and growth doesn't exist. People are more interested in gossiping and playing politics than improving their skills. 
IBM literally needs to increase the bar at the time of hiring. People who don't know anything get the job and become leads/managers coz of their seniority and then torture you.

Pros
Competitive salary, work-life balance, collaborative culture. I didn't enjoy my business unit, but I met a number of supportive individuals very satisfied with their careers who took the time to speak with me. I would not be opposed to returning to a different line of business.
Cons
Competitive advantage in larger, multi-year projects which can offer less professional development for skills sought out in more innovative tech companies. I didn't find the work to be challenging or stimulating - I did find some people that would have listed this as a 'pro' which is also disappointing.
Advice to Management
I was disappointed in how I perceived HR to handle a sexual harassment case reported by a peer. Without details, I consider the decision by the HR investigator to be retribution against the victim in an attempt to intimidate her from taking further action. This fully negated any positive experience I had with the company and I think the policy, if implemented correctly, is an ethical failure.

Advice to Management
Empower employees to do good work rather than jealously guarding work flows. Employees could do so much more if just given the opportunity, but everyone knows they'll get in trouble if they don't stay in their lane. This breeds complacency and then management wonders why the company loses to competitors.

They are abusive, forcing you to work even more even though you already have a lot on your plate. Inconsiderate to their employees. Management knows where they are lacking but they just don't care. They just want you to do the impossible then won't even pay you what you deserve. Extremely low salary increase. No bonuses. Until resignation, they will outsmart you. 2 months is the render period then they will hold your salary also for that 2-month period. Just thinking of themselves. Not even a little sympathy on their employees. You won't even dare to come back to this kind of company. Very cruel and not fair. I regretted that I've been in this company.

IBM Cloud solutions have already been introduced into various parts of the UK’s National Health Service, contributing to the efficient and secure running and delivery of care to patients. One such example is NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) which employs IBM Business Process Manager (BPMoC) and Operational Decision Manager on Cloud (ODMoC) to maximise utility within the organisation’s structure. There are multiple benefits, and include the streamlining of delivery, maximised utilisation and equity of organ allocation nationwide, and the freeing up of vital resources. October 2015 was a seminal moment for the partnership, with the first transplant of a heart allocated according to the new scheme taking place. Innovation did not halt there, and NHSBT is exploring additional possibilities afforded by IBM’s cloud solutions, including expanding platform capabilities to encompass kidney and pancreas transplants.

Advice to Management
There is a clear focus on attracting younger, cheaper employees. This comes at a cost to intellectual property. Frequent employee turnover also means too much time is spent on-boarding new hires. It also doesn't foster employee loyalty. Young guns stick around 2-4 years then take the better offers $$.

Business Outlook
Pros
Working at IBM you're always (if you're in the right group) surrounded by smart people who can teach you a lot - about tech, running projects, and turning projects around. The WLB is also good, and direct management definitely seems to care about you as a person.
Cons
There is a culture of mediocrity (slow and steady would be the nicer way to put it), that seems leftover from the old days when 30 years at IBM guaranteed you a full pension. For the most part, managers seem surprised when you ask what it takes to get promoted quickly. It's hard to get straight answers, and frequently the manager who gave you advice winds up leaving by the time they suggested you get promoted.
Advice to Management
Make it crystal clear what is expected from each band level, and what a consultant has to do to get promoted. Transparency is helpful, so better yet publish standard salary ranges for each band too (ignoring outliers, like 15 YOE band 8's). If you want to keep top performers around, you need to compensate them properly, and make the career growth path visible.

","My experience working with IBM was really very disappointing. I am not lucky enough to be under good management unlike most IBMers .

As a fresher after 4 months I was assigned to a project where only 2 developers are there in a project. After 3 months my senior left, all things came on my shoulder. I was given good reviews for Project work but got least hike and reason was very funny.
My father got sick I asked for location change . They told they will do, but didn't keep their words each time asked for update on that came with various reasons. In between covid came so wfh was there. I worked in additional hours (US times) but no shift allowance I got. Previous year I was waiting for good hike, since most of the project deliverables was of mine. Against it was disappointing hike. I decided to move on, after got some offers I resigned. Then they offered me good hike along with my preferred location, I but denied straight way. In my case neither they appreciated hard work nor kept their words regarding working location change. One more thing was I took sick leave since I got conjunctivitis, later they deducted this from my Planned leave for something because of project utilization as a team (don't know what actually it is) which was really unique. But some of my friends are under good management, they are not facing similar things.

Advice to Management
Management should be more transparent. Close monitoring required for management team to ensure corruption and biased attitudes are addressed. Secondly, management should focus on client relationship improvement, which is one of key reasons that IBM is loosing projects.

Pros
I liked my teammates, my manager and my benefits. Had more good experiences than bad, but I had to get out of there in order to advance my career in Workday.
Cons
Utilization always came first before talent development, quality of projects was poor and IBM core was already stretched for senior level Workday consultants because many of them already left. There was also no structure for advancement or learning if you were new. No mentors, or training path. There was no way to get yourself off the bench to pick up more hours doing other Workday projects or post production support. You get placed where your manager decides they need the billable hours most. Sometimes you are forced to get ""cross trained"" and never get to do Workday again. Other Workday partners don't operate like this. I don't recommend if you're new to Workday.
Advice to Management
Overhaul your Workday practice. Model it like other partners. Give new consultants structure for advancement, stop denying them training, and do what other partners are currently doing better.

- You are expected to take on roles that are well outside your abilities and preferred career path
- Dramatic understaffing on projects as a means to improve margins 
- All the good resources are leaving, meaning there are no good mentors and everyone is being forced into roles they’re not capable of (see second bullet point above)
- IBM’s obsession with cross and upselling at all costs has led to building Frankenstein ecosystems that don’t work well or provide true value to clients. It’s disheartening to be worked to the bone to build something you’re not proud of 
- HR more or less does not exist and every internal system and process is as convoluted and confusing as possible. It’s amazing the company can even function given how poorly it is run

2021-08-08, SSR ,"Saint Louis, MO","Current Employee, more than 8 years","No raises, no bonuses, and will work you to death and still ask for more","If you enjoy not having any sort of personal life, than being an IBM service technician is for you. My normal hours are Monday thru Friday 8-5 and on call one week and weekend a month. In the evening and on the weekends, you’ll have the opportunity to be harassed by customers, dispatchers and management trying to get you to leave your home and family to go service a machine. They sell 24/7 coverage but yet have nobody working past 5pm. They rely on us monitoring our phones when we are off the clock. It’s a great system and a great company to work for..... so much so, that I am willing to take a cut in pay and benefits in order to get the heck away from IBM. 9 years with them and it gets worse every day.
","No personal or family life... at all. Every plan you make will be ruined. Not enough staff to cover evenings or nights anymore so your subject to working any old time they call u. You have to literally request off your weekends if you want to do anything and even then you will be pressured and harassed to work because of the number of customers wanting service on the weekend and not enough people to do the work. Our new CSP system has created a ton of barriers to even do the job. Folks all over the world are ordering parts for us and are sending them all over the place and then we are on the hook to track them down. If you want pertinent info for the ticket, you have to drill down into several different menus... it’s terrible and has made an already tortured life at IBM that much worse. I wouldn’t tell my worst enemy to come work here it’s so bad. Everyone on my team hates this job with a passion and most retired the moment they could. The ones left can’t keep up anymore and working 30 hours overtime every week is getting old. Oh yeah, health insurance has gone up so much since Obamacare came out years ago, that I’m now on the “emergency” plan with hsa because it would be almost 500 a month for me and 2 kids on the good plan I used to be on. Dental is 130 a month for me and 2 kids. We used to get a small bonus every year of a thousand or less (before taxes) and they managed to take that away from us to. Being a technician for IBM is the bottom of the barrel. We are the red headed step children that IBM doesn’t give 2 craps about yet we are the ones who actually see the clients face to face. Guess what, I have nothing good to say about IBM to clients when I’m around them. Sorry for the rant, but I just worked all day Saturday and then had a code upgrade project that ran all night into Sunday and didn’t get home until 6am. Funny thing is, that’s normal for us these days and it shouldn’t be. There is NO limit to how much they will make you work.

","Management is at best mediocre. Opportunities more often than not are based on who you know not on ones ability. Salaries tend to be lower than comparable positions at other companies. This has resulted in the loss of top personnel over the last several years which coincides with loss in market share.
Advice to Management
The current management and the associated philosophies need to be reviewed and rebuilt. IBM needs to reward and promote based on accomplishments and ability not on workforce politics. Mediocrity should not be how IBM is viewed.

Pros
It is an ocean of varied opportunities. If you really wish to experiment and make a career, then the support is immense. Both resources and mentors are always in plenty.
Cons
Loads of bias, conscious and unconscious, seen in some Leaders, especially the ones who preach about culture, diversity and inclusion. Waiting to see how IBM transforms these leader so they do not have negative influence on the rest.
Advice to Management
Leadership at all levels is not as transparent as they boast to be so please be sensitive to the employee's needs rather than imposing the strategies and decisions on them. Forces some very resourceful employees to leave because they are unable to tolerate the racism and bias.

Overall company culture is really good - every day respect of others is essential.
Good company to start with. Good place for those who need to see, experience the friendly and respectful cultural attitude.
","Too much effort to plant the Big Blue Family vision in to the heads of employees - family is one and only and work is ""only"" work. Employees should feel good, safe and professionally performing their best knowing that they can lean on the company in terms of guaranteeing their future - I did not feel that and saw too much so called ""resource actions"".
Too much additional tasks to fulfill in a year, think40 / badges, honestly I barely met people who took that seriously and not because it is useless but because in this region it does not really gets you any further in your career.
Most of the times you have to change department / position to get higher in ranking and get better compensation, it has a negative side as well because if you get too high no department will want you to employ due to higher ranking / compensation range.
I have not seen attractive motivational assets during my career in IBM, bonuses are on the level of a joke, cafeteria is one of the lowest comparing to other companies.

","For some reason for the past 10 years (2010 - 2020) you feel some parts of the company's technology (along with stock market capitalization) falling behind compared to competitors.

Advice to Management
Mid-level executives (i.e. VP's) should stop protecting legacy sacred cows and embrace new technology. IBM could have been the leader in cloud if they had concentrated on it in late 2000's instead of emphasizing on-premise computing. 
To attract young workers, move work locations closer/into major cities.

Although they didn’t pay for office equipment beyond your laptop and docking station. Want a nice chair? Pay for it yourself. Fast internet? Again it comes out of your pocket.
","They didn’t pay for squat. 
Even though you may have been working 45 to 60 hours a week for the last three years, you only accumulate the “standard amount”. If you leave the company having took a couple of extra days, they will send you a bill for the difference.

If you are in sales, they will come up with every BS excuse they can not to actually pay you your commission.
Advice to Management
Stop screwing over people. You have low pay compared to industry standards. People stagnate unless they work 60 hours a week to become an STSM or DE. Get rid of your lying sales management. Pay the commissions people are promised and earn.

","Management focuses on accomplishing immediate objectives with little focus on planning for future success; Too much focus on making exceptions to processes as opposed to finding permanent enhancements to improve productivity; Upper management not receptive to suggestions for improvement; Expectations to work long hours and over weekends and holidays.
Advice to Management
Managers need to focus on what they can do today to improve results in the future. Everyone is focusing on doing what it takes to get through each business quarter to make that business quarter objectives, and no focus on long term goals. Management is not aware how this type of management effects plans for personnel resources in the future. Revenue numbers are embellished to get from one quarter to other.

","Company has been around so long, and is so big, yet some how has no idea what it wants to be when it grows up.
You're just a number there.
Bad work life balance.
Management frequently doesn't has a clue about the things they are managing. 
To long of a chain for information to get from the frontlines to any level of management where change could be made, and even then that management would have no understanding anyway.
They buy companies, change them to be IBM, then all the employees of that company they just bought end up leaving. 
They are just a bunch of brighten companies that don't even know what each other is doing and don't mess in anyway. Often their own products to better on other clouds than IBM's own cloud.
Way too much red tape. Too hard to get simple things done.
Discriminatory environment. 
Don't even provide references...
Just avoid this place.
Advice to Management
Promote from within. 
Don't assign managers from other groups that have no real understanding of what they are even managing.
Listen more to the front lines and customers.
Do more to keep the employees of the companies you buy, they are the real asset.
More effort and a better system to have the companies you bought to work together on common goals. To much right hand not knowing what the left is doing. Customers also are frustrated by the complete internal disconnect.

2021-07-19,Anonymous,,"Former Employee, more than 8 years",Overextended and undervalued Finance organization,"Center of Excellence was a great place for university hires to develop technical skills and network. Relocation packages (back in 2014). Many different teams you can work for, you can move teams annually if there's an opening. Long-standing culture of remote work. Flex days given to compensate for demanding work cycles. Having IBM on your resume still counts for something in 2021.
","Paid under market value, discussions of a pay raise are not entertained. Promotions in title and responsibility only, without commensurate pay raise. Bonuses for high performers are trivial, <1%. 

Lack of communication during large, critical reorganizations. Regular layoffs, including veteran employees. Open positions are not filled year after year, those remaining take on the extra work. No strategies to work to improve or replace low performers, high performers take on the burden. 

Upper management create toxic work environment where employees are terrified to make mistakes. Pre-COVID: depending on who you report to, remote workers are told to relocate or find a new job - inconsistent across company. 

Finance works long hours and weekends during monthly/quarterly closes and planning cycles. There is no work/life balance during these busy cycles.
Advice to Management
Promote hard workers and high performers. Backfilling veteran employees with offshore resources and expecting the same quality work is not sustainable.

","Working for (some particular branches of) GBS means you'll never maintain the same tech on your resume. This made it somewhat rough finding another job. You will need to be adamant in communicating that you want to be on similar projects. If you're starting, try to choose a popular tech stack and stick with it. 

The branch I was in was definitely top heavy, promoting individuals that weren't particularly ready in my opinion.

While there is plenty of room to move up, the raises are slow going but I am very satisfied as a junior dev to mid working there.

Remember GBS does not reflect all of IBM!

2021-07-16, Associate Product Manager,"Raleigh, NC","Current Employee, more than 1 year","Good pay and benefits, mature employees, boring culture","- Great experience
- Salary
- Benefits
- Big tech industry experience
","- No one has cameras on, feels very impersonal
- Not a lot of care for early employees, no coaches or mentors
- Siloed within current business unit / org. No visibility into other businesses at IBM. Hard to feel connected to larger strategy.
- Very easy to feel unhappy or lonely in this role
- Much older crowd. Most people here already have kids or grandkids, so they don't take an effort to talk to other people or learn about new hires.
Advice to Management
Take more interest in small talk or conversations about personal lives. No one on my team knows my birthday, anything about my life, or congratulated me on my 1 year anniversary.

","Something is terribly wrong when a company has at least annual layoffs (often 2 or more in a year) going back 10+ years. No genuine regard for their employees. No accountability in senior or middle management. If you are a part of an acquisition, you need to understand the clock is ticking until they start to include you in their “resource actions” (wake up Red Hat) especially if US based. Truly a shame that a once great company has devolved into shell of its former self.

","ultra low salary, no enough level salary increment especially in the countries where there is inflation problem with the local currency. 

No level 1-2 manager support for career opportunities.

IBM culture differs from a country to country. IBM Global sees some IBM country organizations as an internal customer and forces to use services from IBM India like cheap locations but this strategy causes two problems. 1) IBM India resources and the organization is terrible! and 2) Valuable technical resources in client! countries think that their value is not seen by IBM.

Most of IBM managers in edge country organizations just think their careers and behaves their employees like modern age slaves.
Advice to Management
Create an environment to monitor the facts! in all countries. Monitor the projects with negative profits!! and find the reason why some projects have negative profit and how it is hidden from IBM global!

Monitor the managers and their behaviors by keeping in touch directly with the employees! After Kyndryl, IBM will loose the direct contact to the customers which will create a huge gap between developers/central teams and the customers

Great product and services portfolio and great customer. Being honest almost all all the fortune 100 companies use IBM product.

Innovation and patent hub if you are a creative person.

Great work life balance, unlimited sick leave, and work from home facility.
","As this is old organization, still have bureaucratic structure, which they are trying to get out of it. Still need more work. 
As per my understanding, Indian management is very poor, lack of vision and skill. 
Good customers are moving out, sales team is very poor and their attitude is squeezing the existing customer, not generating good sales. 
Poor career growth and hike. People try to stay due to work life balance.
Advice to Management
Please work on restructuring the business and operating model. Also, hire some good sales people, do good branding. 

Technology innovation is not working due to lack of vision for recent time. IBM into the cloud space in last 10 years but couldn't do anything due to poor offering.

Not taking up RDB in right time made Oracle to became largest,
selling up and splitting up business like networking, BPO, consumer business, managed infra is bad idea. It could have been restructured.

Advice to Management
IBM would really grow if the Internal politics and Nepotism vanishes away, and if the right talent is given opportunities. Lot of people are promoted just for showcasing other's hardwork while they play a smart card game, this should end. Real talent should be identified and provided good support which will help company's real growth

2021-07-04,Anonymous,,Former Employee,Sinking Ship,"IBM was once a great company to work for. Pensions, good benefits, education reimbursement, training, great management, etc. Unfortunately, now this company is a shell of it's former self.
","Pensions gone. Benefits slashed. Good luck on getting anything reimbursed (even internet access and phones for remote employees was cut). Horrible, toxic management so infested with workforce politics that even Queen Cersi from Game of Thrones would blush.

Employees are in constant fear of resource actions (RAs) and management is in a perpetual cycle of evaluating who the next person(s) to include on future RAs. (Forced rankings/PBC where employees have to compete against each other never went away).

IBM was late to cloud computing and never made any in roads to market share. Their technology is outdated and (offshore) customer support is horrible. There are many other fantastic Cloud companies to work for these days. Stay away. 

IBM has become irrelevant.

","Trend towards offshoring means drastic headcount reduction in the UK especially for technical staff - seems to have accelerated in recent years, which is very demotivating.
Advice to Management
It may already be too late but for those UK technical resources that still remain - look at how much clients value having skilled people close to their business location as opposed to people located thousands of miles away. This may work for some functions but not for more involved support issues, or close project collaboration. Seems like a lot of business has been lost due to this issue.

Loved being a part of the consulting training program for new university graduates. Helped me develop a network or peers and mentors which is required to thrive in such a big organization.
Cons
Missed opportunity for career development. It was quite often for consultants to get stuck on long projects at the expense of the development of those consultants' careers. This made the outcomes really bleak and resulted in a lot of great talent leaving.
Advice to Management
Find a better balance between meeting the needs of clients, the business and developing your talent.

Salary is fair, around what you would expect for a ""good"" starting salary. 
Environment (This is based on the people in my team) 
Supports WFH
Certifications, and badges are free (Udemy and IBM learning)
They implemented a Java Bootcamp for us for the hiring process, we did not finish it but we learned alot.
","Upon passing the Java Bootcamp, they hold our employment til August/September even though other companies are already onboarding during the Pandemic.
Even though our bootcamp is for Java, most of us, including myself, did not get a Java position or atleast something programming related.
We are forced to work during weekends, prior to the client's request. 
No immediate OT pay.
If you're looking for a stable career path, think twice before entering here, there might be a possibility that you won't get what you want from the start or not at all.

","The management showed prejudice between different departments. It's not easy to build a relationship as a team when the management doesn't set a good example. The manager also displayed favouritism behaviour and treated the team members unfairly, for example, someone abused the sick leaves but there was no disciplinary action taken against them. While others only took a few sick leaves but were penalised.
The managers lack basic leadership skills. They don't nurture or care about their staff, act like a bully when issues are raised. They also lack empathy and the ability to relate to the people who work for them. Other than that, they are not supportive for instance, if an employee is requesting a lateral move, they will give unreasonable excuses to prevent the employee from pursuing new and better opportunities. In addition, they make it difficult for people who wish to leave the company.
The company implement an archaic 'punched card' software in which you have to inform in writing how many hours you worked in a day including your leaves even after making the submission online. Other companies are using better software to keep track of the workforce management.
Advice to Management
Please hire competent managers who do have basic leadership skills and are able to guide their staff. Also, Pulse needs to be reviewed and the anonymity of the employee should be protected. That way, the company would know whether the manager might need more training.

","Supplemental employees didn't get raises, even after 4 years. No 401K match for Supplementals, so you really need to negotiate your salary up front because the bonuses they offer are only for the first 6 months. Even if you get promoted, you might not get a raise. Health insurance for Supplemental employees was horrible. The worst I have ever seen. Extremely high deductibles and out of pocket maximums(the amount you have to pay before everything is 100% covered).

","Treat the graduates pretty poorly, there is no transparency with them when senior management make business decisions. Lack of support for individuals and treated like 'resources' instead of actual people. No control over your own career and only put in roles where it suits management best, rather than where you actually want to work. Managers make you do a lot of admin work rather than actual valuable roles and also little client contact. Little to no recognition and acknowledgement of your career aspirations. Retention rate after the graduate scheme is terrible, they can't seem to hold on to the good ones.
Advice to Management
Treat graduates or those who have transitioned off the graduate scheme better. Have more transparency with them and also listen to where they actually want to grow their career.

2021-06-26, Full Stack Developer,,"Former Employee, less than 1 year",Below average tech company.,"· Classic tech company amenities: free coffee, snacks, drinks. 
· The majority of coworkers are nice and friendly. I genuinely appreciate some of them and these few were the highlight of my experience. 
· Huge bell curve. Top engineers there are brilliant, but the worst ones are unmotivated and coasting. Average engineer is nothing to sneeze at. 
· If you want to coast, a good place to do it. Seemed like people could wfh whenever. 
· There are opportunities to work hard.
","· Pay is not competitive for the location. 
· Bad apples. While they exist in every workplace, their existence speaks to the company's culture and behavioral hiring bar. Now that I work at a better company with coworkers who don't exhibit any of this behavior, I'm not afraid to talk about my experiences. One of them in particular harasses vulnerable people and says the most grotesque things that have no place in a professional environment. He hides behind his long tenure to get away with it. No one except for my mentor spoke up about it and some of his work friends even encouraged him. I would highly not recommend working here if you are a young woman. 
· Management lacks structure with task assignments and does not keep promises. I worked overtime for a reference and never even received it despite promises from and reminders to my manager. Looking back, I realized I was being exploited by my manager and tech lead to do as much work as possible. 
· Lack of formal structure. Despite being a big company, absolutely no structure for anything except for the bare minimum. There's no way to keep track of tasks.
· Mediocre engineering standards. Not much of a formal code review process and poor code quality.
Advice to Management
Keep your promises and if you want to attract talent, you need to increase compensation.

People come and go, management never changes, it is promoted to higher hierarchy. Current employees are not receiving incentives, always have to deal with the no-employee-retention unwritten rule, no raise, new employees hired. The company rewards the people that ""play the game"", your skills do not matter.
","Salary way below the average pay for the role, no raise, no technical growth, lots of useless corporate ""tasks"" , micro-management in weekly bookings, way too many meetings . God forbid you receive a project with a team assigned only on that one project for decades! The arrogance, the waste of time people in management in this company are willing to offer, only to keep an old project where they cannot change the other many years old team it is completely absurd. Project Managers that are always happy to throw another log on the fire when the building is burning, staying in their positions for years, must be changed urgently! Obsolete software, low number of vacation days - working with Germans shows you IBM has such a thing as a personal holiday for employees there, but for Romania overtime is paid only for those few preferred persons
Advice to Management
Hire competent HR, recommendation from employees should be taken into consideration, not only from the one person preferred by the management. Do not hire based on gossip. It is not only unethical but it causes problems along the road and you just add one more thing to the dirty politics existent already. Change people in management positions, chenge the confused senior leadership, but not by promoting them.If non-management employees come and go and the direction is still not moving forward, guess where the change should be made? Motivate your employees, bring better technologies, stop the toxicity and do your job!

* Enormous growth opportunity. You definitely reap what you sow. Invest your time in learning and picking up new challenges and you will see amazing things with your growth within the organization.
* Overwhelming amount of Learning. There's so much of learning materials (You'd hope that you had all the time in the world to complete those). Coaching and Mentoring comes easy as people are always willing to do it without any disparity.
","* Very process oriented organization but that's understandable as it's a huge matrix organization.
* Change is the only thing that never changes - happens too often at times (You have to keep up with it).
* Organizational changes can affect your employment. (But you're always given the option for internal movements for any available vacancies which fits your profile and experience)

 Working in b-shifts and c-shifts are less
 Women are provided cabs from 7 pm onwards to reach home safely if you get approval from your project to bear the cost
 IBM provides unlimited sick leaves which no other organization has
 There is no stringent 9 hours work policy. No swipe-in and out policy to record your working hours. Complete your work with no defects and you are good to go :)
 Work life balance is good
","IBM is not recommended if you are joining as a fresher. The opportunity to grow within the organization being a fresher and working at the most lower band is minimal. Exceptions can happen - ‘You are lucky if you get a good lead and manager’
 You don’t get any perks for your hardwork. Poor pay package, almost no onsite for band 6
 The company policies (for hike,onsite,band progression) are not very transparent and no scope to contact your HR. Your only hope is your People Manager. Your future in IBM is in the hands of your manager

","No new opportunities,
No hikes (even after 5 years of hard work and loyalty),
No HR interaction,
High managerial dependency,
You are just a number.
Advice to Management
Loyal and hard working employees need hikes as well; their salaries should at least reflect the market value of their skill, but in truth - their salaries are less than 60% of their market value. I know many such disappointed people in IBM India.

You cannot go ahead and look out for new opportunities internally no matter what you do. My manager in the last project I was a part of actually said it to the face of his team members - ""you won't be released from the project, you can however quit working in the company"".

In another incident one of my colleagues actually had to fight with his manager to change the project so that he can add a new skill to his knowledge. He had to go the upper management and include them in this fight of values. Even then, as a final resort, he could only separate from the company in the end, frustratingly!

Trust me when I say this, even after working for 5 years in IBM, I am the least paid employee in my team of 25 members.

2021-06-16, User Experience Designer,"Markham, ON","Former Employee, more than 5 years",Just… ok,"Benefits were very good, especially for mental health coverage.
Free parking and EV charging
Decent starting salary 
Flexible work schedule
","Toxic work environment with management. 
Organization often “switched gears” in vision, resulting in wasted designs/work. It felt like the product teams had commitment phobia when it came to seeing through project work. 
Managers/ execs would often talk down to subordinates or be very passive aggressive. 
Politics were unbelievable! Lots of strange things happening behind the scenes around promotions and pay raises.
Bonuses are practically non-existent unless you push for a good deal when you are hired. Don’t expect much in terms of salary increase moving forward.
The lab that I worked at is in the middle of Markham… the commute really sucks unless you live nearby.
Advice to Management
If an employee works well and is highly skilled… make sure you offer them reasonable pay increase, promotion opportunities and bonus payouts. 

Please treat folks with respect and dignity. Some managers were very nice, but I was shocked about how many managers/executives were awful and pretentious.

2021-06-15, Software Developer,"San Jose, CA",Current Employee,Solid company but not extraordinary,"- My coworkers are pleasant and generally capable.
- Generally rewards excellence
- Lots of free materials and courses to learn from
- Work hours generally fit a standard 9-5, only had a crushing load for a few months of my 3 years here, and it's largely my fault for overestimating my ability
- Good managers invested in my growth and career
- Good base pay
","- I've kind of been left to my own devices since 1 year and 3 months in. I'm happy to take ownership of the product I work on, but I don't feel like my technical skills are up to snuff without having a senior help me learn what I don't know.
- Promotions weren't hard but they aren't easy either, there's only so many positions to go around.
- A decent amount of turnover in the sense of people leaving IBM for something better.
- The directives from upper leadership leave something to be desired.
- It's a big, bloated machine. It works, just not always quickly.
- Good base pay, but no other compensation

Cons
The worst management to ever find in a multi-national company. 
Many brothers and sisters in the same team makes you feel it's a family business not a big company. 
If you didn't ask about your benefits, you may not take any! 
Not fair when it comes to project assignments or annual evaluation.

2021-06-12, User Researcher,"Austin, TX","Current Employee, more than 1 year",User Research practice still has a long... painful way to go,"There is so much to learn. So many amazing people to learn from. Salary and benefits are ok. IBM is hybrid and flexible work friendly but seriously clinging on to the co-location strategy.
","The User Research practice at IBM still has a long way to go. User Research is still not recognized as its own independent discipline and rather considered a specialty under design. If you are a User Researcher and considering joining IBM. Be prepared to constantly be called a ""Designer"". Be prepared to not be included in many conversations and decision making efforts because many still don't understand what user research is or how it can help other than concept testing. Be prepared to be told what to do by the design discipline because ux designers and user researchers don't have equal seats at the table... you will not have a easy time. You will not feel fulfilled unless you luck out and have a team that somehow has established a better process than the rest. You will have a difficult time growing your career here as a User Researcher. You will have a very difficult time recruiting participants, you will be micromanaged, ignored, etc.) You will witness UX Designers get promoted and awarded and applauded frequently while you feel stuck... bored.... stressed.... overworked.... fatigued.... unmotivated.....depressed
Advice to Management
Recognize User Research as an essential discipline and provide them with needed resources. Educate product teams about the value of User Research and how/where to engage them.

","1.For a fresher, IBM is not at all a good company to start with if you want a good salary
2.Hike and bonus are very less, better than TCS, Wipro, Infosys. 
but Accenture is better than IBM regarding Hike and bonus.
3.Cost-cutting is very much in IBM, they will make sure that they will pay you less.
4.Also, if you get a mainframe project or mainframe Technology, please start looking for other Technologies, Don't waste your career.
5.Also if you get the Chubb Kolkata project, please don't join it.
Advice to Management
Please value your employees, do not think that the company is greater than the employees. Do less cost-cutting and pay your employees well.

","Limited exposure to work with clients, dysfunctional sales methodology. Product roadmaps were very unstable and often rebranded and shifted products in a way that left clients unsure of what they were buying. Many of the software products are created and not maintained, either from FAQs all the way to functionality issues. Also the company really isn't ready to sell in a cloud based world, there are still a lot of perpetual licenses and the company really struggles with selling usage based products like AWS.
Advice to Management
Stop the crazy HR churn which adversely impacts teams as well as roadmaps. Be more open to making the products easier to use and focusing less on creating opportunities for GBS. Stop forcing solutions that are bespoke just to win GBS revenues when in the long run you jettison software sales for products that are less transformative.

If you hear funding issue means its time to start searching other jobs.

No big data no hadoop only excel testing.

Lots of politics.dont bother about your skills only become servent of managers to go forward and thats enough for geeting good position.

Micromanage ment are at its highest level.each min what you did should be recorded and ready with answers.

Business Outlook
Pros
- Puts a premium on integrity above everything.
- Follows a pay for performance philosophy.
- Encourages and fosters continuous development of its talents.
Cons
- Several managers are ill-equipped to adequately support and motivate their teams. There are those who have no genuine connection with their direct reports, lacking capability to build rapport and sense of belongingness among team members.
- Some leaders are out of touch on what's happening on the ground. At times, strategies don't make sense (example: compelling a broad range of sectors/service lines to be cross-certified in technologies that are irrelevant to the experience and skill sets of the impacted practices).
- Not all centers are created equal: no matter how willing you are to work across borders, there are geos that simply don't work well when put together, especially in high-pressure engagements.
Advice to Management
I hope that regional/global leadership is looking into what the countries are attempting to do, especially ""mandatory"" certifications. Please do not coerce people into taking certifications for the sake of racking up the numbers against the competitors. ""Great"" that we're aggressive in building our eminence through these certifications, but please have a sensible, well-thought strategy on who should be required to complete them. We're already stretched thin with our assignments and engagements. Obliging some service lines to be cross-certified in technologies that are irrelevant to the experience and skill sets (also: don't improve our current jobs, expand the pipeline for our practice, and help us progress) is dispiriting enough to make us consider taking our talent elsewhere.

On the other hand, please refine on and enforce a development plan for Manager / Senior Practitioner roles and up. There are very few leaders in our immediate organizational level whom we can aspire to emulate, even fewer who have the finesse (or even domain knowledge) to work with aggressive clients. It's painful to see supposedly senior talents limping their way through client interactions after being shot down for not having domain expertise and the polish to make up for it. Our clients deserve so much better; we IBMers deserve so much better.

Advice to Management
using a recruitment agency, where your staff have to find decent candidates and then pass on to them if they want any contractors that are half decent is crazy. Especially when you pay the recruitment agency's fees when the IBM staff have done the work. Also, for large and complex organisations, contract staff who stay for between 3 to 6 months will mean you can never support companies properly or to any high standard.

Cons
Low expectations on employees leads to few interesting pieces of work (in Ireland).
Tendency to 'pidgeon-hole' graduates into roles once they've been trained in something i.e. if you do an SAP project you will be pushed to SAP almost always.
Very few work-benefits - No subsidy for food, not even free tea / coffee in either office (Mulhuddart or Ballsbridge)

Really unmanaged management.
","Please, dont join IBM if you are ambitious and come from varied skills. Even if you are confident that you can be good, then also the movement and managerial restrictions will exhaust all your efforts. So, please rethink before joining. 

As you may have heard, IBM takes 3-5 years for giving any salary raise and that too depends on your performance. No special bonus. Dont get lured by their business ventures and other things as long as you are working on an individual level.
Advice to Management
Please, for the sake of humanity better yourself. Enough careers have been dusted down because of you management. Unnecessary restrictions have made many employees loose their passion in their job. Even the market reviews say the same if not just my review.

I found that subject matter experts were generally easy to get in touch with and learn from if proactive about reaching out. There's always something exciting happening somewhere in the company, and offering management has great exposure to much of what goes on. Found IBM's corporate values were generally prevalent across the company. Met many people who became sincere friends outside work.
","Matrixed company felt disjointed and difficult to move around; it seemed like two people could have the same job title and be doing very different things, or be in different parts of the company and have very different experiences. A lot of bureaucracy at times, and the work could be a grind. 

If you love engineering and dev/ops, you'll probably be happier here than if you love B2C work. When IBM gets it right, they really get it right, but you have to know up front that IBM isn't the right place for everyone.

- 13th month pay
- Benefits
- Colleagues are great and they help a lot in decreasing stress
- Gives a lot of experience in interacting and communicating with all types of people from all over the world
- Develops your communication and professional skills
- Reimbursements for transportation and work related purchases
","- Typical call center work
- Stressful job
- Don't expect to take your lunch and breaks on time
- A lot of stats and milestones that you need to reach
- More work but no increase in pay
- Management lacks integrity in some matters and prone to change their minds on certain decisions
- Transportation reimbursement is denied even if former employee worked during said dates
- Management keeps leveraging agents to do different types of work instead of focusing on the agents already assigned to that specific task which contributes to the piling up of workload
- Too open and friendly culture, which is good actually, but sometimes breaks the line between professionalism and a lack of decorum.

The data center you work at will shape your experience. It can end up being a dead-end job if you don't take the initiative to try to get transferred(which was a goal set by management). Worked at a DC that was poorly managed. Good entry level position for experience, a lot of the people I worked with only cared enough to keep their job and only looked out for themselves.

2021-05-26, IT Architect,Noida,"Current Employee, more than 5 years",IBM India is a good place to work if you are consistent.,"Overall healthy environment. Focus on your work, keep publishing articles, papers, assets... keep yourself visible. So many opportunities to learn and grow.

""Great place to work for women"" (in quotes...). Policies and culture are very sensitive towards women's safety.
","Few points:
* Very easy to get in the comfort zone. There are fix formulas to survive in IBM, and they keep changing with time. Complete projects with 'n' rating, publish 'n' articles/assets/papers and you are good till next KRA. On the face, this looks fair, but this is manipulated with 'visibility'. Visibility in IBM is like SEO (search engine optimization). And there are non-organic ways to increase your visibility. I'm not suggesting that this is the fault of IBM, this is just humans being human (or desis). 

* Growth is slow in general unless you have great visibility. 

* Organization has no face. You can work in IBM for years and years and never meet your manager, or somebody from accounts, HR, etc. . Everything happens via systems, which work like a well-oiled machine. But without faces it gets uninspiring. Nobody is there to push you to grow, to learn further, to actually innovate. So if you are not self-driven... you find yourself either in your comfort zone or in survival mode.

So find a mentor and few close friends near your cubicle (or in your Zoom call list), regardless of their role, competency, or color (of the project... Green/Yellow/Red, etc. )
Advice to Management

2021-05-21, Applications Developer,"Baton Rouge, LA","Current Employee, more than 1 year",Here's the thing,"As a current IBM employee, it depresses me sometimes to think back on my past employers and just how many of those workplaces were managed by ""man/woman-children"" who -- more often than not -- let emotion and personal biases control the daily decisions they make. At those places, *genuinely* good ideas by lower-level staff would be ignored 100% of the time if the idea somehow threatens the manager’s brittle ego or even *slightly* increases their workload. These were Tywin Lannister-wannabes I’m talking about – that view their employees as a group of undisciplined children requiring constant supervision, restricting the tiniest of freedoms and establishing authority by reprimanding non-offenses. For these ""control-gestapos"", managing isn't the goal. Coasting through a life of upper-middle class perks and authority (in title only) is their only motivation. They inhibit any and all culture and creativity from a work environment and drain the lifeforce out of their staff. Sirius Black would never have escaped if Azkaban had a swarm of micromanagers flying around in black hoods. I will be honest with you here… I consider each and every single one of these Putin-sympathizing, workplace-tyrants out there actively defiling our country’s workplaces to be my eternal arch-rivals. 

I guess what I’m trying to say here is IBM does a good job of saying “do this thing by the end of the month” and leaving you alone.
","You will be constantly losing roles to other IBM-employees who are more qualified because their CV shows they previously worked in a similar role.

","Layoffs are more frequent than you would like them to be. Valuable peers will be let go, then you will see a new team get created and you wonder why they could not just reassign your peers to the new team.
In many sites, promotions can take forever. To get promoted, you better be ready to look at a different company.
If you stay there long enough, you may end up with a mindset that everything is better at IBM, limiting your chances to move out quickly if you get laid off.

Pros
Like any entry level consulting job, you're surrounded by other bright people.
Cons
IBM's public sector consulting branch struggles to find its way at times. It's difficult being competitive with established DC players like Lockheed Martin, and at times the company values contract retention over individuals' professional well-being. I know that they were willing to accept some behavior from clients that wouldn't be tolerated in an IBM-internal setting.

You can't force staff to undertake higher graded roles for the same salary. You can't expect staff to joyfully work at 110% when you openly Offshore every GTS UK role going. You expect commitment and glowing Checkpoint feedback but offer no pay rise (or <1%) and no bonus so basically no incentive.
Management had no interest in what I did prior to TUPE. Everything just seemed to rotate around ensuring Monthly Pay Dates were met by Customer. Customer satisfaction was subsequently less important that ensuring IBM had been paid.
Plus side was I (personally) was left to get on with my Projects and you could work from home relatively freely.

Pros
1. Learn New Technology
2. Brand with Oldest Tenure 
3. Allowances
4. Cab Facility
5. Work from Home facility
Cons
1. Hike is less 5 to 10 % max every year 
2. Band Promotion is not fixed, you can get that depending upon your upper management, if upper management is good you can get it in 2 years, if not they will never take interest in 5 years too unless you say it from your end.
Advice to Management
The only advice I joined at 2.9 P.A and after 4.5 Years I am not equal to 4 Lacs and there is no hope to reach some good package in future which definitely make person seek something good outside .
Hope so the company will work on the cons.

2021-05-11, Identity and Access Management Analyst,Bangalore,Current Employee,Employees are not valued,"Good learning opportunity , access to certifications and encouragement for learning.
","No hikes at all ,work pressure, pathetic managers , no growth you will end up working for years in the same role . this company is run by managers and HRs don't have a clue. nothing is transparent , so much work pressure that you might have mental illness. there is nothing encouraging to work more. I spent 2.5 years and got 400rs hike after working with all my efforts . the CEO and management are only worried about there performance in wall street and are not sure about anything that happens internally.
Advice to Management
Please have a HR team who can monitor on managers who are partial towards employees ,Please be transparent about how an employee can improve his financial benefits. no one deserves a 400 INR hike even after working for 2.5 years in the same firm and being a loyal employee. every account managers have their own rules and make and play the act accordingly . the whole system should be fair for every employee .

2021-05-10, User Experience Designer,"Hursley, England, England","Current Employee, more than 3 years",Hopefully doing a big turnaround... heading in the right direction!,"Recent leadership changes (last year) are really prioritising growth.
Very accomodating and flexible place to work.
Amazingly passionate technical teams who LOVE the technologies they work with.
","1. Bureaucracy, bureaucracy, bureaucracy! Totallly siloed business restricts the innovation that teams can actually perform. Business processes are so opaque and varied across business units and even manager to manager.
2. Slow to act on climate goals - employees branded ""idealists"" for asking climate-related questions in CEO ask-me-anythings.
3. Had to essentially get another job offer on the table to get an overdue promotion. Requests were ignored despite having ~8 senior employee support statements. Ended up happening in the middle of a bad quarter, which gave leadership the appearance of being shocked and desperate. 
4. So many people! IBM has one of the biggest workforces in the world - and isn't moving fast as a result. Definitely adopted Agile (in some teams) but not Lean!
5. Often hard to trace through from corporate strategy to your functional role... but this is getting better with concerted effort from leadership sharing strategy.
6. Very few opportunities for progression in the UK in comparison to the rest of the world - and no opportunity to relocate.
Advice to Management
Keep heading in the same transformational direction. Be careful not to go on a hiring spree after the recent RAs. Keep bing pretty ruthless - more needs to be cut to turn the company around and make it profitable. Employees are ready to work in a growing environment - you need to give them that, not just tell them how to behave.

For example, one year a portion of my team received a significant portion of additional pay due to an adjustment based on working hours. It appears to me that IBM Payroll self corrected this without employees prompting the company for it. This shows IBM internal business is conducted strictly based on the written policies.
","Company is encumbered by unnecessary processes, not nimble. Top down managerial approach. Company made acquisitions but does not know how to keep the vigor of the acquired entity alive, instead, shows down the energy by IBM's old fashioned culture and our sector was eventually divested from IBM so I say IBM need to think through their acquisition strategy. If you have multiple acquisitions that did not work out, it seems to question the business judgment of the leadership.

","This company is constantly playing catch up with their products. They are trying to stay relevant by buying other products which do not provide for seamless integration. Even legacy products are lagging compared to newer company’s offerings. The senior management has no care about creating relationships with their clients. It’s about the sale, regardless of what the customer needs or wants. Senior management is all about the metrics of how many calls or opportunities you create - valid or not. It’s a toxic environment for sales people. Commissions are being reduced annually. IBM thinks the future is fresh from college hires, knowledge and business savvy be damned. They want sheeple, mot people with brains or a conscience. Morale is pretty bad amongst lots of organizations.

While brought on to do UXD my role is 50% User Research—fortunately I have the education and experience to design and conduct valid user research. Good work culture: I love working with my team of engineers
","IBM keeps dedicated proven performers on contract because ""they don't have the budget"" ...Paying significantly below market rates, there is no incentive to stay even when I'm exceeding expectations, love the focus of my work and my team is a great fit.

There is no design at the leadership table and while there is an expressed value placed on UXD I have to doubly work to help management understand design principals, trust design decisions and realize (this is big) what constitutes valid user research / design research.

Good benefits.
","-Working for the TAO (Talent Acquisition Optimization). Last year, IBM and the client made the launch of a new recruitment methodology. These are the things that went terribly wrong: 
*They gave us poor onboarding, months after the office launch.
*There was a huge and constant escalation culture.
*Poor planning of the processes and procedures.
*They changed recruiters to this position (clear demotion) and helpdesk agents too (with no rise in payment, even though they were doing the same as recruiters). 
-Poor (or no) HR involvement in the situation.
-The talent care advisor position is just a call center appointment scheduling position. They sold us the position as a great growing opportunity.
- The majority of the team resigned to look for better opportunities. No one did anything about it. They just let us leave.

2021-05-03, Pre,Sydney,Current Employee,What’s the Difference?,,"der IaaS as the foundation to future-proof your business. IaaS solutions are designed to be highly scalable and flexible, meaning you can buy additional resources and features you need as your operations expand. Compare this to having to buy more physical hardware and hiring more IT professionals for maintenance as your business grows and you require more storage and servers.
Cons
One good analogy for IaaS is that of a leased car. Say you are in the delivery service and business booms. You don’t need to buy a new delivery vehicle but simply lease another car to keep up with the growing requirements of your business. As demand continuously goes into an upswing, you just lease another vehicle and so on until the economic equation justifies investment in a new car. Buy a new car at the onset then suddenly business drops and you end up with an unwarranted expense.

Pros
Don't really have to do much. Decently strong brand name depending on the group that you are in.
Cons
It can get boring. Most of upper management and leadership is out of touch with younger generations. Essentially a tech company run by their accounting department. High turnover with young people as they are leaving for opportunities that have more responsibility, room for growth, and superior technology and leadership. Also, there seems to be minimal to no bonus incentives for performance; this causes demotivation. Good first job, but not somewhere to stay long if you are highly motivated.
Advice to Management
I don't really know at this point. Should really clean house at the leadership level and have younger people with more technical acumen make the strategically decisions. Too many non-technical people in leadership roles.

We realize IBM makes a good share of profits by being a patent hoarder - and thats nothing new. But it would be great if we could stop putting promotions, raises, and recognitions behind arbitrary pattent counts - most of which contribute nothing to the world, let alone a chance to actually be used.

2021-05-02, Technical Writer,"Austin, TX","Current Employee, more than 3 years",Well compensated but overweight on personal responsibility,"IBM is a historic company and trying to turn a new leaf with a younger workforce and recent acquisitions/divestitures. The overwhelming majority of managers use the ""as long as you get your work done, we don't care how you spend your time"" guiding principle. This flexibility has been a lifesaver during the pandemic, where working from home has been anything but a walk in the park.
The compensation appears to be above market and I feel appreciated for my work. The benefits package is a bit underwhelming but made up for in base salary.
","A company this large can be hard to navigate. We live and work entirely in TLA's (three letter acronyms) and knowing them all is a point of pride for some. Getting acclimated takes time and requires individual effort to break silos between teams who should be more communicative with each other.
IBM places a lot of responsibility on individual contributors to complete projects and often makes last-minute decisions that change the trajectory of our outcomes. If you're not married to your work, you'll be fine.

Large enough for you to choose a career change without company change, weathers country and global recessions well
","Lost it sense of being a large family; Staff no longer feeling proud of working for IBM. Focus of the board is fully on shareholder returns and not on staff; despite the fact the largest asset IBM has is the experience and passion of its staff. Employees essentially have become the equivalent of worker drones who are not developed or brought on unless have the right longstanding personal network with a sponsor, though with the unwritten 2 year role cycle any sponsor can quickly disappear
Advice to Management
Look to how staff were managed and supported in the early 2000's. there was a sense of belonging to something staff could be proud of and dedicate their working passions. This you have lost at the expense of chasing stakeholder returns often forgoing salary increases despite giving big share dividends

2021-04-29, Security Delivery Specialist,Hyderābād,Former Employee,Overall it was good experience,"1. Work culture is good (subject to job roles)
2. Leave policy is the best in industry
3. Some Leadership is real, especially the HQ
4. LGBTQ+ inclusion
5. Work from home existed even before COVID (IBM, I am sure didnt have a problem adjusting to WFH during COVID)
","1. Poor, if not poorest, in pay/compensation which sadly constitutes the major decision for joining an Organization or not. (Don't be gullible in think 'compensation' isn't primary factor - it should be everyone's decision making factor.)
2. Manager centric Management (so if your immediate Manager is horrible then whole positive gone out of window)
3. Some of the tools IBM use are a drag (though on positive note they also bring latest apps into fold but only on early adopter based & not applicable to all)
4. Some BUs are very toxic like Mainframe/Console Operations
5. Don't join roles below Band 6 - to Management Employees literally don't exist as can be witnessed in their programs & initiatives for Employees
Advice to Management
1. Fix your COMPENSATION package & subsequent BAND increments. This is where IBM lost many gems to competitors. Right from its start. 
2. Get uniformity in open & safe (from unhealthy stress & pressure) work culture across the job roles. Check your attrition records of BUs to see which one are performing poor. Employees haven't left because only ""money"" but because of Managerial attitude on ground. 
3. Jobs below Band 6 is where some of your important work is performed. Recognize them and help them grow. Concentrate on increments there than at & above Band 6.

","They have a performance table that you have to meet. However, if you are running at say 94% efficient throughout the year, just before you go for your annual review mysteriously your efficiency drops below the threshold... This is a way that they keep you working extra hours for free. It's not uncommon to be working at 10pm to right a report that no one will ever look at. Also on your pension contributions it's supposed to be say employee pays 4% and employer tops up with 8% etc... Not true, you as the employee pays the full 12%, the pension structure is cleverly set up. If you ever work there, check your payslip ASAP.

I feel like I can ask anyone a question and get what I need to do well. The design studio is a very collaborative and fun environment.
","Design at IBM is quite young. As a result, not all of the teams at the company really know what to do with designers. We try to advocate for being involved in the entire product development process, but we're sometimes brought in at the last minute or the time our work takes to do is de-prioritized. Across most of the company, there isn't a very strong process in place, and it's hard for design to truly, seamlessly collaborate with our partners in Dev and Project Management. Which can be frustrating.

2021-04-26, Applications Developer,"Manila, Manila, Manila","Current Employee, less than 1 year","IBM Solutions Delivery, Inc. (Philippines) - Fresh Graduate (2020)","- Certifications. You can take free certifications here whether it is cloud related or whatnot.
- Learning resources. You have free Udemy and internal IBM Learning Resource.
- Experience working with known companies.
- Free covid-19 vaccination.
- Brand (IBM is a well known company)
","- Salary. This must be the lowest one when compared to its competitors.
- Benefits. Still, not even close to its competitors.
- Higher Management. You know there is a big problem when a fresh graduate felt that there's something wrong.
- Incentives. Non-existent (maybe depends on project)
- Bootcamp. Not that extensive when compared to other companies.
- Known / Big companies are not for fresh graduates. If you have a career path that you want to pursue, never ever apply to big companies who doesn't put what you're going to work on specifically (fullstack development, mobile development, analyst, etc.). Even though you're the top of the class during bootcamp, that doesn't matter at all because they will give you a random role. More than likely, you'll get a support role (ticketing, monitoring, and excel).
- Covid19 response. We passed bootcamp in March 2020, we were deployed in September 2020.

I declined numerous offers between March 2020 to September 2020 with the role that I want because I trusted IBM. I took my internship here (which is miles ahead compared to my current work) and applied here. I didn't expect this from IBM. Its like they didn't even took a glimpse at your resume. Not recommended unless you don't have a career path planned ahead.

2021-04-25, Manager,Istanbul,"Former Employee, more than 8 years","Not the ""old"" IBM","The IBM name still resonates with the older people in the IT market. Usually has good training, basically you can get any virtual training you want.
","There are constant layoffs and unfortunately most talent has left the company. IBM lost the cloud game and is constantly shrinking. Best leaders and employees left to work at new generation companies. Company strategy doesn't make sense.

Salaries and benefits are low in comparison to competitors. Promotion is very hard. Salary raises are usually below inflation levels. Benefits have diminished over the years, for example, the BES contribution is laughable.

The company car plan is outrageous, even if your job requires daily use of a company car, IBM charges you up to 2500TL monthly on the rental car. No proper gas or OGS plan, you basically need to pay them and then get reimbursed.

It feels like you constantly need to fund the company, just like the car, there are a lot of things you need to pay out of your own pocket. For example, when I left, lunch allowance was 15TL/day, which is ridiculously low.

You can create your own schedule so work-life balance is super flexible as long as your closing deals. I like how we are market segmented, so I only work with customers in a particular industry. Great for providing similar market use cases between customers. Travel was abundant prior to COVID which made the job worth it.
","Number driven, Executives are not supportive, not great culture. I feel alone a lot when it comes to getting help or support from a management level.
Advice to Management
Have your best interest in your employees overall career, especially younger sellers. Make it a priority to understand employees career interests rather than just making sure they hit their number and stay put forever. Be active in providing band raises so sellers feel they're progressing rather than digressing. Make employees feel more valued with encouragement and recognition. Filter out the pressure to perform from Executive leadership so sellers can focus on their job.

2021-04-21,Anonymous,,"Former Employee, more than 8 years","Some good, some bad","- Benefits are good - health insurance and family leave is some of the best I've come across in the US
- Exposure to technology and projects that have a lot of real-life use cases and global impact
- The majority of the people at the ground level were some of the smartest, most interesting, passionate and enjoyable people to work with
- Lots of opportunities and resources for self-driven learning
","- Compensation was VERY low compared to market and then didn't increase much over the years, regardless of performance (negotiate well when you first come in, because it pay won't move much once you're here unless you have a manager who is really willing to go to bat for you)
- Everybody in the org was massively overworked - most people were doing a team's worth of work and we were constantly told there was no budget to expand resource, yet every little project was a priority; flexibility was good (though this varied from team to team) but work-life balance was non-existent
- No job security - layoffs happened en masse across the company and always loomed
- Lots of interoffice politics and HR drama played more of a role in career progression than skill or accomplishment which led to people running teams or holding roles they were unqualified for
- No stability within the org - new VPs and figureheads were constantly cycling through on a yearly basis - each with different priorities and direction - and constantly rearranging teams which led to not a lot getting accomplished on a long-term basis
- Career development was all over the place from manager to manager - though in the past couple of years there was a big push for more internal movement, it wasn't implemented consistently across the board; a lot of managers were too overwhelmed with their own tasks to spend much time really managing and developing employees

","- You need to fight for leave approval with manager even when there is no work on that time. One persons leave affects others leave approval
IBM has utilization % for project and managers tries to keeps it to 100-110% 
-In IBM GBS salary was not competitive to market standard, small companies pay more than IBM
-Increments was not good ,it can be minimum 2% also(Depends on manager).
-If you need growth you should be very friendly with manager
Advice to Management
-There are politics in low level management, this should be taken care.
-Project utilization % : If two persons fall sick for one month in a project, it affects others leave (Managers tries to keep utilization percent above %)

2021-04-19, Partner,"New York, NY",Former Employee,Be wary of a company that is not growing but shrinking year over year,"Very few, IBM has great technology but unfortunately cannot effectively sell it to customers. No sense of urgency to do so either. The company moves slow, painfully so. Most people join excited and then the company sucks that enthusiasm right out of them with a paralyzing approach to decision making. I am in the executive band and will resign shortly now that they market has picked up. I need to get my mojo back and the thought of leaving is helping me do that.
","Compensation plans change constantly, sometimes multiple times per year, revolving door for execs, talent is weak and most people are looking for new roles, leadership keeps doing the same thing expecting a different outcome. Strategy is built around cloud but market share of cloud is small while competition is growing like wildfire in cloud. When considering cloud, most companies don't even consider IBM. Cuts run deep and impact minorities the most. IBM has great technology but no ability to understand how to use it effectively in customer environments. Industry experience is so weak. IBM shows up and keeps asking clients what they want, no innovative ideas and cannot scale up business (no desire either) until the competition passes them. Too many examples of this over the years. I regret accepting role with IBM and am hoping for a package (ps. packages for execs are great).

Business Outlook
Pros
- Employee Friendly; lots of emphasis on D&I
- Fertile Grounds for Growth; lateral and vertical
- Opportunity to grow by jumping across portfolios (not rare to find IBMers who have worked a mind-boggling number of positions/job-roles across technologies/competencies)
- Loads of investment in learning/reskilling initiatives
- Robust repository of tools for online collaboration
- Opportunities for job-rotation/stretch assignments
- Global Corporate Social Responsibility Program
- Exposure to global teams since most projects run in matrixed environment
Cons
- Lack of a global ""promotion"" policy; think ""promotion"" every FIVE years in some countries
- Poor annual compensation when compared to market standard, regardless of established subject matter expertise
- Negligible annual salary hike (unless you're very high-up in the echelon)
- Incredible disparity in income between those who grow organically and those who are hired from outside
- Not the best appraisal process; the definition of ""Met"" and ""Exceeded"" is subjective and changes oft 
- Leadership are an entitled lot (think developing countries)
Advice to Management
- Top talent promotions need to be looked into - it's frustrating to keep someone waiting for FIVE years and more to get promoted. 
- About salaries - would be interesting to publish efforts the company plans to take to provide at least 10% to 15% salary increments. 
- Need to have a robust career framework model that educates employees on skills required to move to the next level.

- There are really smart people working in the company.
- When you're working with great people they are the reason you stay.
- In some roles you have the ability to shape the role and try out new things that excite you.
","- Salary is below average for the industry, the only way to get on a good salary is through negotiation at hire and after that through promotion of band.
- Very much the in-boys having the power, locking everyone else out
- Management take a view of people being able to switched from one technology stack to another without any thought given to the skills people have been building in cutting edge areas that are very beneficial to the company
- Senior leaders are not able to stand up and have the difficult conversations and truly transform the company. They are too scared even when all of their team are telling them what needs to be said.
- There are so many times there are elephants in the room scenarios and management don't tackle them. There is a serious lack of leadership
- Management expect employees to have no lives and work crazy hours, time and time again.
- Nothing is being done around mental health and employee well being, employees are just meant to deal with their issues without any help even when it's called for.
 - Executives come out with big initiatives without any care for how it's done, causing their teams so much stress on how to execute. There is no vision.
- There is no long terms planning and trying to see what's coming down the line.
- The company is very bureaucratic making it very difficult to get things done.
- It's very difficult to make big changes, there is push back at every turn.
- It's difficult to have the autonomy to drive things forward,
Advice to Management
A true vision is needed. Blindly following a leader is not the way forward, instead people need to be able to build their careers and skills so that they become the best in the field. At the moment with crazy deadline after crazy deadline you're burning people out all being led by Arvind. Crazy deadlines come with many costs, some of which are burning your people and not being able to truly transform the company as you're not building towards a big picture. You have management that are afraid to say the truth, so as messages of what's happening on the ground go up through the management chain they get watered down at each level, so that everything appears to be rosy in the garden. This is creating a toxic culture that has fear at the heart of it.

Business Outlook
Pros
A wide range of technologies that are available to serve markets
Expertise in some areas backed by extensive research and experience
Respect for one another
Cons
Missing Synergy between various practices
Too many levels of Management 
Too slow a growth. Promotions are not based on capability, but based on power groups
No accountability for Partners to perform. 
Success is rewarded to Top Level Management - Failures are blamed on lower levels. 
No Career path planning. You have to figure it out for yourself.
Advice to Management
Invest in solutions and invest in growing people's career. Every individual needs to get a view of what would be his career future. Extracting work without a career promise is same as running a staffing company. Need to have more industry relevant solutions that shows our capabilities. We cannot compete if we do not invest in meaningful solutions for slients.

2021-04-17, Senior Systems Engineer,Calcutta,"Current Employee, more than 5 years",Good place to work but not great,"IBM is a good place to work with very flexible work hour, work from home facility. The leave policies are also very employee friendly. There are plenty of courses available in online portals for IBMers which can be referred for upgrading skills. It's a great place to work if you are a self motivated person with high learning curve.
","Office politics is the major problem. Though it depends on projects, but employees are not rewarded based on performance. Opportunities are not equally distributed. Also yearly bonus and salary hike is very less which will make anyone demotivated.

Nice enough colleagues. Training system is very good, but when you actually seek resource to go and win some business its not available and the process is dire.
","Leadership have clearly lost the plot, obsessed with trying to push Hybrid Cloud when the horse has bolted and already several valleys away with hyperscale providers. Internal process is shocking using lotus notes and Atlas, having to use a password t log in repeatedly to the same applications. Internal sales process is painful and the admin cost to get any sale out of the door is a joke. Not prepared to take people of fee earning work to develop decent bids so you end up with a bench of staff not skilled in the areas you actually need, so you lose the bid. No competitive targets being hit because of this as the A Team is never available and at best you get the C or D team. Management obsess about the current QTR whilst walking towards a cliff edge as no new work being won, But most don't care as will move on promotion or retire with bonus from core work. More obsessed with measuring diversity than addressing the real problems that need real investment like decent CRM and basic email system that works.
Advice to Management
Sort out the basic tools, they are a mess, qualification and release process is a also appalling and not adding any value. Resourcing model utterly broken and frustrating leading to good people leaving, putting 2nd rate teams on bids does not result in winning bids.

2021-04-13, Renewals Account Manager,"Dublin, Dublin","Former Employee, more than 8 years",Use to be great but the Dublin office is full of toxic people.,"Lots to learn, many smart and interesting people.
","Toxic people, under no circumstances tell anyone anything personal including if you suffer with your mental health, as it will impact your career path. A gossip pit. Everyone out for themselves even though your part of a so called team. Poor management leads to bad moral. Most are numbers people and not people's people. A place where you can never switch off or be left alone by management if you fall ill. Massive culture shift within the centre and not for the best. They tip toe around with band increases and it's few and far between. 9 years there and I didn't get 1. Nothing exciting comes from the company anymore. It's lost it's spark. Avoid!
Advice to Management
Stop being yes people. If you look after your staff the numbers will come. Treat people with respect regardless of their mental wellness. Support and listen instead of blame and intimidation. You need people skills so do a course. It will benefit you and everyone around you. If there is a cry for help don't ignore it, embrace it and be the person IBM have hired you to be and finally stop trying to be everyone's fake friend, learn to listen.

Access to a lot of quality on-line education (if you have time to do it after you finish working A LOT of hours).
","Not enough focus on giving people time for career development. Aggressive (sometimes unreasonable) schedules/deadlines for projects. Constant reorganizing of teams and resource actions (lay-offs) leaves many teams understaffed and lacking skills for achieving success. Employees are no longer treated with respect from upper management. Team reorganization and technical decisions are make without consulting the people below actually doing the work in many cases. Most jobs are going to the ""low cost geos"" like India for example. You may benefit from working in IBM for a while, but long term, be prepared to burn out.
Advice to Management
Please treat employees with more respect. Communicate and get input from people at all levels when making decisions. For the greater good of IBM and individuals, invest in your people by allowing time for training (they are not just ""bodies"" to throw at various projects as you like to call them).

- There are lots of smart people there, so you can learn a lot from others
- The IBM name looks good on your resume, for when you want to apply to other companies after working here :)
","- Pay is average in the industry, and not very negotiable
- Hard to move up in the company, too much bureaucracy and politics amongst team members

I have met people from all walks of life, made good friends and had the chance to see the world by means of international collaborations within the company and outside of it. The nature of my work also allowed me to explore and develop new technologies. I have worked across multiple domains from emergency management, healthcare, to financial services, and this allowed me to grow as professional significantly.

The things that I value the most in my current job are the people I work with, the problems I am asked to solve, and the trust that my peers put in me when I comes to working together.

- Good base salary
Pros or cons depending on your point of view: 
- very academic environment 
- strong fundamental research focus and not much applied research
- focus on publications and not impact on products
","- It is in constant transformation and transition. There is no stability; teams shuffle and research directions change all the time. 
- Benefits aren’t good. Compared to big tech players very bad.
- the location is quite remote. There is nothing around the campus. 
- the food is meh.
- Most people joined IBM right after college. So they don’t know how other tech companies work. They still work in 80s-90s work style.
Advice to Management
I find the lack of applied research and the constant transformation were the biggest issues with the company. With no concrete and clear goal, the research seemed pointless. But again if you just wanted to do academic research and don’t care about products, it may be good for you.

","- Doesn't really invest in their employees in terms of education
- Very withholding of promotion/increases
-Pay may seem great upfront but won't feel as plentious overtime
- A lot of managers are ""gifted gab"" .... they talk the talk but not nearly as many walk the walk. I suspect it's because many of them have just been here long enough to get the positions.
-Managers have an issues with upper management demands which they may trickle down to you . Won't really address that they are being spread too thin
Advice to Management
Most people who have joined in the past 5-7 years probably leave within 4 years of their time there. There is no real incentive to stay unless you have dedicated a lot to the company which most people aren't doing anymore in the tech space. There isn't a lot of reason to stay at the company unless the person likes their management and what they're working on and that's more of an individual variable versus the company maintaining their mission as a whole. There isn't even a welcome package for folks who join..you'd be surprised to see how many folks who work here who don't even own a decent t-shirt with the company name or a water bottle. Not saying that this is the solution but is a small demonstration of how small the company does relating to it's employees . I've also seen other companies recruiting former IBM employees to work for them...that says a lot about the retention rates of employees.

Pros
Good learning experiences offered if you can network your way into a sector that you are interested in. IF you can find associate partners/partners to care about you then there are a lot of opportunities for growth.
Cons
Bonuses are based on the company performance, not individual performance so you almost never get one (if you do its like 1K). Also, do not get as many benefits or perks as other consulting firms and pay is better at other consulting firms. I'm a female and sometimes I felt like others had bigger salaries than me just because they were male or bc of who they know.
Advice to Management
Give bonuses or incentives to work harder/better!! Currently there is no incentive.

Big Company-itis. It's so difficult to find the person you need, or to find out the answers to your questions. If not known in your immediate team, good luck.
Advice to Management
Stop changing platforms all the time. Every week there's a new platform or service we need to use. The legacy information gets left behind. But one platform you REALLY need to change is email. Notes is just so out of date and impossible to collaborate with anyone in the outside world.

Invest into younger talent. Attracting them is one thing, but we also need to keep them. it can take more than 10 years to get to a good comfortable salary and many younger talent nowadays do not wait because they can get a higher bump in other companies.

2021-04-06, Finance Analyst,Melbourne,Current Employee,"Used to be a good company, not anymore.","These days about the only pro working for IBM is some of the people in certain areas who still keep the old culture alive.
","The additional employee benefits that IBM used to be renowned for in years gone by have slowly disappeared over time to the point where they are now non-existent.

Virtually everything in recent years revolves around saving as much cost as possible.
The simplest of things such as requiring additional memory for your workstation, or a non standard piece of software are ridiculously hard to get with a stupid amount of justification, approvals and general time wasting needed.

Expect zero or next to zero pay rises even if you're considered an outstanding employee. They almost always find a way to rate your performance down, usually by including the company or line of business financial performance as part of your performance review, or at least using that as a justification.

Telling employees they pay ""market rates"" when that's absolutely not true in most cases. It's also the reason why they will go to the end of the world to employee an existing internal person for a vacant role with minimal if any increase in pay rather than hiring externally where they are forced to pay ""market rates"" for new employees.

Some areas are expected to do massive amounts of overtime with claiming that overtime discouraged by management because of the additional costs involved. It used to be accepted that if you had to work on a public holiday or weekend that you were allowed time off in lieu, although a recent policy change now prohibits this.

Constant fear of ""RAs"" (Resource Actions) aka redundancies under the guise of ""restructuring"". 

Next to zero ability to gain any training other than the basics needed for your role, and it's sometimes a challenge just to get the basics.

For an IT company IBM internally uses extremely antiquated systems.
Yes folks, IBM still uses applications that were around in the 80s and even a few older than that. Get used to using a 3270 emulator on your PC to access those wonderful mainframe apps that are still alive and somehow kicking in the 21st century!
Advice to Management
The company has lost it's way in recent years and I'm not convinced the current or past CEO really knows what direction to take the company in.

You also need to start looking after your employees better otherwise all the good employees will leave and you'll be left with with a bunch of older folk close to retirement age who are just biding their time and others who can't find work elsewhere.

The constant fear of RAs is really, really hurting employee moral and will take many years to turn around after the RAs cease. Those employee surveys don't always tell the truth because many employees don't believe they're anonymous. It's even got to the point where IBM is now the butt of redundancy jokes at a number of other companies.

2021-04-05, CyberSecurity Engineer,"Austin, TX","Former Employee, more than 3 years",IBM is where your career goes to die a slow and meaningless death,"- they pay money in exchange for work
- people are impressed when you say you've worked at IBM
- you have the ability to learn a lot of things and gain exposure to a lot of tech
","- extremely difficult to get a promotion or move laterally within the company unless you're friends with the right people. the internal jobs board is meaningless and broken.
- org is so top heavy that your managers will have no power to make positive changes within the org. the real decision making power lies within the manager of the manager of your manager's manager. Your own manager is just a puppet there to make you feel like your words mean something and serve as a punching bag so that upper management is isolated from the discontent of the lower class.
- IBM will not give meaning salary increases even if your original role is greatly expanded and you are doing the work of 4 other people concurrently. If you are in a lousy division, expect that this will not change.
- IBM has this cult mentality over 'badges', which are obtained via completing small mini courses that do not test you for real skill aptitude. You need to obtain a lot of these in order to gain visibility in IBM. Basically, you need to wear above minimum pieces of flair.

2021-04-05, Applications Developer,"Mountain View, CA","Current Employee, more than 3 years",Poor compensation and growth,"Not many pros. 
1. Like other service based companies. 
2. Trying to maintain the name and fame in the market. 
3.This company is good for the trainee level, senior level and Not for mid level who needs to switch in between.
4. Some work life balance is there depending on projects and manager.
","1. Bed compensation and growth. May be there will be no hike at all for two three years, no matter how much you give effort, if your PMR is more than 100%.( It is an rating of the same band in the market assessed.) Based on that you are getting paid and there is less chance of renew or audit of PMR rating. So if you don't know how much ctc you will get according to your Band before joining, and if it is more than the PMR rate you will end up with no hike for next couple of years.

2. You will be entertained or pushed to do some side work, contribution or help in other projects but that will not help or will not be considered in your career progression. So don't be happy too much.

3. Less chance of getting promotion. You may get lots of appreciation mail doing good but that is the corporate trap to make you feel good which will not help you at all in your career growth.

4. Sometimes company performance which I saw most of the time is below average will impact your appraisal.

5. Managers in IBM is like termite they don't have much context of the project and latest technologies, market standards but still getting huge package. which indirectly blocking the progression of below levels. Don't have proper attigates to behave. Specially at the time of appraisal. 

6. Notice period is 3 months so before joining need to think twice as time of job change it will be a nightmare. As hr will look for the people to join immediately but they will release candidate after serving full notice period.

7. Check for the project details as you may need to work in local client location.

8. Less onsite opportunity. At least less chance within 3 - 4 years.

9.Mails are circulating each and every day regarding the good developments or profits of company which is nothing but illusion. If employees don't have growth at all then top level management is having problem. Because end results is null.

10. No proper coding standards and work methodology maintain.

11 Not good for career building for mid level developer.
Advice to Management
1. Stop planning so much without a proper appraisal and rating process. 
2. Give proper hike to employes. 
3. Need to audit on managers performance first.

Let GBS employees working in GTS projects continue to work under IBM GBS,since we bring to the table a gamut of coding skills garnering higher revenue for the company.Consider this as this spin-off is unrolling.

You have the opportunity to grow a lot within Tech Consulting - specifically any sort of implementation or business operations consulting type of role.
Compensation is very fair
People are nice
Work life balance is somewhat there - depends on the project
Cons
Hiring process was ridiculous and not very organized
Types of projects are very limited
Lack of flexibility in working on other projects - if you want to expand into a new industry, you have to go through a few loops to get sign off to work on something else

Great starting salary, fun to start with a big start class, opportunities to work on many projects in first year.

Feeling like just a number and unable to control the path of your career there. They just place you where they need you and don't take into account your actual interests. Very broad about your role when they hire you (not clear what sector/industry you will be assigned too) and make it impossible to switch.

","Only innovative in certain areas, i.e. Smart Cities and Quantum Computing with not a lot of true innovation elsewhere. Transition into IBM is poor, leaving employees floundering in their first 1-2 years. There is a huge amount of institionalised red tape, which makes the company very intra perspective and not externally focused, with a lot of old guard managers, who are equally institualionised and driven only by process and politics. Promotion is based largely on revenue generation, which promotes a lot of incapabilities amongst senior managment that don't have the correct level of EQ for strategy or people management. Your IBM experience will be based on who you report to.

Pros
There are some interesting projects and nice managers
Cons
Promotion process is not equitable or transparent. If you are POC or a woman, you will be held to a different standard and be expected work harder and prove yourself more. Managers will gaslight you and even manipulate you by dangling the promotion carrot to work longer hours and deliver with little or no resources. And if you are a genuinely hard-working and capable person, you will be expected to clean up after people's mess instead of participating and leading career-building or self-development initiatives. Leave this place before it destroys your soul!

","My experiences have not been good with IBM. This is a company that was once a market leader, but is struggling to make the connection with the changing needs of a digital world. And they are panicking. This results in continuous changing priorities, reorganizations, mass-layoffs, broken processes, frustrated customers, and deceiving managers saying one thing but doing something else.
Some might have a grand time at IBM and be safe from the politics that is going on, but for anyone considering a job in IT I would just say this. You deserve better!

2021-03-27, Senior Engineer,"Dublin, Dublin","Current Employee, more than 10 years",Very weak senior technical leadership,"At engineer / developer level, generally a good company to work for. Interesting set of technologies. The local management / leads in Dublin are sheltering for the more general BS at wider company level.
Good work/life balance, ability to work for home.
","This is a company driven by non-technical exec at the top, and a chain of non-technical managers, which is resulting in a very low technical level compared to competition in the Cloud space. Very different from the likes of Google, Amazon, etc.
The vast majority of senior technical leads (STSMs / DEs) are relatively weak - do not exhibit any real leadership, do not have any specific expertise/technical talent, do not understand what is going on at lower level, and have mastered the exercise of BS / politics to seduce their non-technical exec masters. 
Genuine technical talents typically leave the company before they reach senior level with rare exceptions.
Bunch of clowns running a Cloud like it is an on-prem software from the 90s.

2021-03-27, Software Engineer,,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","Decent place to start a career, but not a good place to stay","- IBM has a very open and accepting culture. Everyone there is really nice and usually easy to work with.
- Good work life balance. Being out of the office for appointments, children's events, mental health, etc. is very well supported and encouraged.
- Some of the projects are cool, and it's rewarding knowing that many people depend on the software you work on.
","- I couldn't tell you how many people there are that do literally nothing and never get fired. It is infuriating feeling like you could do the same and it wouldn't matter.
- Some very talented people work here, but at the same time, many incredibly un-talented people do too which ruins the company's/team's progress.
- The pay isn't competitive. IBM will always lose it's best talent to companies with better pay, benefits, and less red tape.
- Deadlines are a mess. I'm surprised customers continue to use IBM products at times given the outages and issues that occur so frequently at the end of every quarter.
- Designing for the customer gets lost in the complexity of IBM's systems. There are so many features that seem good on paper, but are really hard to use/missing functionality that a customer actually needs.
- No one will advocate for you in your career progression - you must do so yourself.
Advice to Management
- You need to clear house and get rid of a lot of poorly performing employees
- You need to pay competitively or else you will always lose your best talent to other companies.

For Learning, IBM provided lot of sources like Free Udemy Access, Coursera Free Access, Cognitive Classes and So on.
Work pressure depends on Project to Project. I worked on both kind of project. Worked 16 hours a day as well or 8-9 hours day in one project.
","No Growth
No Increment or bonus. Even less than Indian IT Company. Many times you get Zero Hike. Thank to god they dont give hike in Minus. Just Joking. I also got 0 hike for two years. So, Their Performance assessment policy is all crap. Managers openly will tell you you wont get hike this year or next year because you already have high package or you should negotiate for better package during Joining.
Lot of pressure on Developers who actually do the job. Manager friendly company. So, if you want the retirement, Then IBM is best.

2021-03-25, Manager,"Durham, NC","Current Employee, more than 10 years",People are treated as an expense line; not an asset,"*Talented and committed individuals; diverse technology portfolio.
","*People are treated like expense items. Decisions driven by short term financials without regard to mission and technological growth. Raises are minimal and not funded well. Investment in education/learning is almost non-existent. High pressure to deliver and continuously invent; while little means to get needed resources and support. 1st and 2nd line management have little authority while having to execute decisions made in the executive ivory tower. Decisions that continually comprise integrity and ethical practices.
Advice to Management
Address the great pay disparities; address the gender bias rather than covering it up with marketing campaigns that disguise the problem. Focus on a technology strategy rather just the next quarters stock price. Either respect the knowledge of your works and management teams. Replace lip service on diversity, pay transparency and valuing people with actual transparent actions and published data to show improvements.

Business Outlook
Pros
Salaries are competitive, office perks are nice when compared to smaller consultancy shops but probably average for a big consultancy. Benefits are average at an international level but rather meager for Canada
Cons
IBM just isn't a bold or innovative company anymore. It is culturally not accepting of the cutting edge and really views itself as a service company that charges a ton for legacy tech to third parties in a bind. High pricing was really hard to justify to clients especially when the company regularly subs senior resources on proposals for largely unskilled and arrogant millenials. A surprising amount of bureaucracy and overhead, and amazingly for a tech company, its own internal IT services are woeful.
Advice to Management
You can only live off past glories associated with the IBM brand for so long. The company needs to walk the talk and that means inventing new things that work and that clients didn't know they needed. Feels like IBM today is roughly 1/3 management/sales, 1/3 admin/support and 1/3 doers that are fresh out of school and couldn't hack it at Deloitte. Not a recipe for success.

Business Outlook
Pros
IBM provides unlimited WFH that is actually good. But do not get over-exicited reading this! Even this can depend on your manager ;)
Working in b-shifts and c-shifts are less
Women are provided cabs from 7 pm onwards to reach home safely if you get approval from your project to bear the cost
IBM provides unlimited sick leaves which no other organization has
There is no stringent 9 hours work policy. No swipe-in and out policy to record your working hours. Complete your work with no defects and you are good to go :)
Work life balance is good
Cons
IBM is not recommended if you are joining as a fresher. The opportunity to grow within the organization being a fresher and working at the most lower band is minimal. Exceptions can happen - ‘You are lucky if you get a good lead and manager’
You don’t get any perks for your hardwork. Poor pay package, almost no onsite for band 6
The company policies (for hike,onsite,band progression) are not very transparent and no scope to contact your HR. Your only hope is your People Manager. Your future in IBM is in the hands of your manager.

","Technical learning opportunities are less and such requests are not entertained. Switching accounts/projects etc are very difficult. Even if you arrange personal self funded training, its not possible to get into your desired roles and responsibilities hence your personal learnings wont be utilized and eventually you forget everything you learnt by yourself. You need to continue to follow the same old orthodox process and policies which are most of them irrelevant in the currently changing environment. You cannot ask Why because that concept is not there there at all. Salary revision/appraisal is not there at all hence you will be continuing getting the same package year after year with no initiative from the management side. Too much frugality in place.
Advice to Management
Implement realistic skill upgradation process and also review fitment of the candidate with the newer requirements with respect to the newly acquired skills. Atleast revise employees salary and compensation once in 3 to 4 years. In case that is not possible to increase it because he/she is already getting the highest salary defined within the band, you should provide feedback about how it can be achieved with skill upgradation, band promotion etc,

If ethics mean something to you then working for IBM should be at the top of your list. I have been with IBM most of my career and that's for good reason. Strong values and respect for the individual. IBM is so vast that you can really do whatever you want. I started my career in an administrative role, moved to finance then project management and finally pivoted into software development and management. If you have the capability and drive to learn new things then you have a company with endless opportunities. Working conditions are very good and both on premise and remote work are available.

","-low pay
-high turnover rate
-trained data analyst, but title remains data engineer
-can't take concerns to management, they will assume quitting is your only option
-12 hr days depending on your project
-frequent project hopping
-projects not always geared towards your skills or career
-in office management staff separate themselves from employees
-micro management from certain managers
-raises are low and keep you under average pay until you've reached 4 years
-CICs are located in economically distressed areas for tax breaks. This means although you have a greater number of minorities working, a large chunk of minorities within the greater company are making less than the US average for their job role.
Advice to Management
Treat your team members as equals. Respect goes both ways. If someone has a concern, address it calmly and don't assume we want to quit when we're looking for positive change. Push harder to increase wages rather than increasing the number of new hires. Renegotiate tax breaks and offer higher pay to current employees. Or develop a program that helps current employees transfer to IBM corp. It's not practical to expect employees to stay below average pay when counterparts working the same projects are making double in the same field with the same skills.

Good training for sales such as global sales school. You get to work with a lot of talented people not only locally, but also regionally and globally to help you close deals with customers and that gives you good understanding of business lessons learned from the different people.
","Constant yearly changes to groups and the products. Spinoffs and layoffs. Difficult to get a band increase unless you have a good manager. They kept changing territory you handle which affects your performance and have to start from scratch often. This decision makes no sense. Lots of internal obstacles to go through to make sure you get the commission you deserve. Politics is always there.
Advice to Management
Hire good leaders, not managers. Streamline operations to make it simple. Ensure that hiring process is better so that new coming managers just don't hire everyone they worked with previously and the culture becomes toxic. We had oracle guys jump in and they gave favouritism to their new hires also from oracle.

Business Outlook
Pros
We, IBM’s employees, have access to various online courses (e.g. Your Learning, Udemy) and we can learn whatever subject we want. For instance, some colleagues focus on developing business core skills while others are studying data sciences and AI. We can keep on learning any topic at our own pace besides working. 

These online courses furthermore accelerate our motivation. After completing online courses, we receive certification badges. The badges prove our skills (what we have learnt from the courses) and then encourage us to assign to our desired project. In addition, our learning time and the number of badges also become the areas of annual evaluation. Thus, we will receive rewards if we take curious/interesting courses and develop our skills as much as possible. 

I personally would like to keep learning something new and unfamiliar while working. I appreciate these online learning contents and enjoy taking them.
Cons
The working time depends on the project.

IBM encourages employees to keep learning and they have a lot of resources for it. I am here for one year and It was offered me a bunch of certification options. Also, the company has a very open platform for internal candidates which is pretty good when you get tired of your role and decide to jump on another path. I have worked with very experienced managers who allowed me to have an open conversation about my career, aspirations and problems I had.
Cons
I think the company has a bit old business strategy and right now you could feel more comfortable about your future in another big tech or this can be an opportunity also. But who knows, right?? Anyway, they seem to be working on that right now.

Pros
I got interviewed at IBM Hinjewadi Pune. Selection process was good and handy. They gave me the job location pune however the job opening was for Bangalore. As IBM strongly supports WFH culture, I got my personal laptop kit in Corona situations. Transformation teams do keep eye on your status to get onboard. I got my project and my manager was so supportive to understand my work. I got sick and availed huge sick leaves. Thanks IBM. I also delivered Migration project successfully and got rewarded with Blue Points.
IBM doing great in Cloud Technology however news coming out are not showcasing it. 
IBM has their own products like IBM Watson, IBM Cloud. 
IBM has their own Learning Platform which covers all the trending and legacy tech courses. IF you are a learner then IBM is ur place.
Cons
Finding and seeking help from HR is a task.
Considerable Perks
No Salary Hike
Advice to Management
Should not give a lot priority on client side work culture and time zones. Stand with IBM Employee and do trust on them. They are asset.

Cons
You need to learn to grow. If you are good to learn new things and keep on polishing your skills, accrue new skills, this is the best organisation I ever experienced in my 20 years career.
Growth is very much but in turns of increment, this could be not that impressive compare to other organisation.

Work life balance.
If you don't have aim to grow in life then join it.
No technical specialty required to get hired or in projects.
","Zero Career Opportunities.
Working in IBM as system engineer will make you rusty.
No HR is there to share your problems.
Manager don't communicate.
Manager don't accept resignation.
Bad projects.
Support Roles only.
Very poor hike.
Very old technologies.
I can't show my experience, even after working 1.5 years I learnt nothing being in support role that too of poor technology.
Night Shift and Sunday shift.
I tried to switch to another project but they will not consider you. Don't know for what do they have internal roles.
Only politics going in INDIA IBM GBS.
Advice to Management
Talk to your employees.
Give domains based on interest.
Hire support engineers if you want to give support role.
Have some values and ethics.

Lots of exposure in PS to other larger companies that working with a small organization would not be possible. Room for growth is pretty open.
","The downside is similar. Its a really large organization so you can very easily get lost in the shuffle. You can very easily put in a ton of hours getting things done that are needed. Not that this is a bad thing, but just be aware of it. This is not a 9-5 role.

","Employees don't have the choice to choose their technology or the kind of project they want to work in(support or development). There is a 90 days notice period and we cant change our project or location in our free will. It needs to be approved by upper management.

Potential to support value added initiatives and drive client success, and thereby promote overall job satisfaction

Decent benefits
","Politics and silos can impede career progression

Every year of employment came with the feeling of unease that came from the real or imagined job insecurity driven from a multitude of layoffs - I was the last one remaining from my start group (the ones I kept in touch with) of IBMers; so there's either something very wrong about the hiring process and/or there's something very wrong with how IBM values and grows it's employees

I've seen 100% utilized and well reviewed coworkers laid-off for no reason other than someone(s) had to go even if they were needed and actively contributing, given a corporate directive to trim headcount, etc. revealing the truth that ultimately you are just a number
Advice to Management
Beyond checking process boxes to demonstrate that IBM cares about its employees, actually do care about your employees and don't adversely impact their careers by engaging in arbitrary head count exercises. Maybe for example treat all IBM employees as you treat IBM-Germany employees by incorporating some of the employee protection practices used in that society (or other societies) which place a greater value on their people.

","- Low pay relative to other ""big tech firms""
- No perks
- Offerings & business model are behind their competitors 
- Lack of effective leadership
- IBM's own consulting arm (Global Business Services) will consistently pitch competitors offerings (SAP) to customers rather than IBM's-that summarizes IBM in a nutshell
Advice to Management
Cut costs, reduce redundancy, and invest those cost savings into the offerings and other cloud offerings. Change the business model from transactional to run-rate and start focusing on the changing needs of your customers rather than your own internal priorities.

","IBM has a history or creating great products but doesn't feel the urgency to get these to market quickly and doesn't seem to be able to scale anything effectively. It's a place where the mediocre can not only survive, but thrive. IBM lost the cloud war and is shrinking year over year. New people come and go but the strategy doesn't change. they don't listen to clients or care to understand anything about the clients business. It reminds me of when I was a client, they show up and tell you that they do everything then ask you what you want. Nothing has changed.
Advice to Management
Change the strategy. Accept that you lost the cloud war. Use Watson and artificial intelligence as a differentiator before the competition beats you in this space as well.

Very accommodating culture. For example transgender, disabled people welcomed and accommodated as far as I could see.

Room to progress and if you want a reasonably stable career with a solid foundation it offers that.
","Bad salary compared to other big tech.
Aging, technical debt heavy technology.

Always trying to ""adopt"" and catch up. Rarely hear of new breakthroughs coming from inside like other big tech (there are a few exceptions).
Advice to Management
The current culture is very entrenched which will make any change difficult. Many products could use starting from scratch. The company has a lot of very lucrative long term relationships, which unfortunately causes a lot of problems. It is scared of jeopardising and cannibalising current products with innovative ones. The company also does not know how to target small businesses. Unfortunately, even if you refuse to risk losing customer revenue by launching better offerings, you can't protect them from competitors. The quarter-by-quarter no-risk no-vision attitude (which has its place) just can't survive forever in tech, which is why we are seeing revenue constantly being nibbled away as the cash cows are gradually getting wiser. Despite some weak engineers there are a lot of good technical staff. If you hired in some superstar leaders with true demonstrated vision, proper freedom and incentives to build major products, and some great modern engineers to build cores for new teams, I am sure current staff would get behind them gladly.

2021-03-03, Content Director,"New York, NY","Current Employee, more than 1 year",Good place to get your feet wet in the tech world,"- IBMers are known for being genuine, nice people. I haven't experienced cattiness, aggression, or any other negative interactions.
- Brand recognition is high--having the name on your resume is good even if the company isn't as prolific as it once was
- There's a big emphasis on professional development with endless resources
- Excellent work/life balance--I rarely work past 5 PM
- Big budgets to try out different marketing efforts
- Working with brilliant, well-educated, respected SMEs is both humbling and exciting
","- IBM is an enormous legacy tech company governed by bean counters, compliance officers, legal teams, and others who minimize our risk. It can be over-bearing at times. Processes always change, and usually not for the better.
- Lack of junior support on most teams. You'll have director-level and lead-level employees stretched thin because they're still doing the same responsibilities even after they're promoted
- Some department execs are lifers (20+ years) which is good and bad. They know the inner machinations, but also tend to be less risk averse or have limited understanding of how marketing happens outside our company
.- We are using email software older than I am and have no plans to migrate off the platform anytime soon.
- IBM has an uncertain future. While other tech companies are booming we're reducing in size. How is that possible?

2021-03-03, Software Engineer,"Hursley, England, England","Current Employee, more than 1 year",Lagging behind other Big Tech firms in multiple ways & dimensions,"— Decent benefits 
— Good diversity
— Nice campus (Hursley, UK)
","— A lot of red-tape and bureaucracy.

— Very few internal opportunities for growth. Moving teams is virtually impossible, which means there is very little talent reshuffling. Most of the graduates leave the moment their graduate scheme is over, which means that IBM loses its best talent (judging from how difficult it is to get the role), and loses the 2 year investment. How's that logical to anyone in senior management baffles everyone around. 

— Moves very slowly and has incredible difficulties keeping up with Amazon and Microsoft. The burden of legacy outweighs the benefits of a 100+ years long experience.

— Looking from inside, I would definitely not bet any money on the long-term growth of the company. In fact, I would short the stock. Warren Buffett seems to agree.

— Too slow to innovate, too slow to fire, too slow to adapt. Simply, too slow.

— Amazon's valuation is 15th times higher (as of February 2021), whilst they have 1/10 of the patents that IBM has. What does that tell you? That you don't win in the market by collecting patents for the sake of collecting patents - what a waste of brainpower and money. You win in the market by being smart about the industries/products you go all in for. During the last ten years, the world has seen one of the longest periods of wonderful market returns in the stock market (look at any big tech company, apart from IBM) - if you invested in IBM, you would have lost 50% of your portfolio, since that has been the absolute return since 2010-2012 peak. Sweet.

— The company's agility is similar to the agility of someone same age as IBM.
Advice to Management
• Cut down the bureaucracy. 
• Properly increase the temperature when it comes to investing in the right products and industries. 
• Get rid of the bad weeds. Invest in keeping the good talent. 
• Innovate to win in the market.
• Stop collecting patents like it's a coin collecting competition for grandpas - you are losing with companies 1/10 your age, even though you have all those patents. And what?

","I was railroaded into a certain role that was not Software Developer oriented. This is pretty much just terrible management overall, and ultimately caused me to leave when I couldn't be moved back into development.

Pay is quite low for a company of this reputation and size. Most companies start upwards of 40k+, but IBM starts grads at 30k.

Some projects are too big and too old, and the technological debt is high.

No bonuses.

There's no structure for getting promotions. Generally, moving up a band is subjective, so your manager can keep you at the same level for a long time, for no reason, if you're unlucky.

","Management is confused about the company identity, wants sales people to sell things they are not compensated on, but messaging is where IBM is going leaving clients feeling of abandonment. One size message doesn't fit the width and depth of IBM's product line and service offerings.
Advice to Management
IBM isn't RedHat and top level management really needs to step back and understand the entire business. RedHat was a <$5B annual revenue company and I fear this $70B company is lost in the RedHat message. A message around cloud is great, but its just one part of the business. You are alienating your current customer base, they know it and are upset about prospects of a future for the investments for on premise they have made, and your employees are starting to be lost as to what is expected of them. Not all Client Technical Specialist are able to be RedHat marketing people and give sales pitches on cloud. Besides those of us who understand cloud, understand IBM Cloud is missing some key certifications and credentials for large customers. Techincal engineers that deal with facts not fuzzy stuff. Career paths are of a concern to this group within IBM.

2021-02-24, Software Development Engineer In Test (SDET),"Dublin, Dublin","Former Employee, more than 8 years",A good place to work in for a few years,"There is a competitive starting salary for graduates, there are lots of very experienced engineers you get to work within the company. There are lots of opportunities to change teams, products or job roles. There’s time allocated to all employees for self-learning (Learning new technical skills, online courses etc..), the company looks impressive on a CV
","Salary stays pretty static, teams working on different components in the same product are a bit isolated from others and this can cause problems when one team makes a change that breaks another teams component without notifying them of the change. Knowledge sharing between team members could be a lot better, there is a high chance of working on a product for two or three years that gets cancelled. Coffee/food/snakes you have to pay for. There’s also a very poor concept of working overtime, you will get your time back in lieu but not cash may not be an option. There’s also a bit of a disconnect from very senior management and regular staff.

Unlike the community and employee engagement side of IBM, the business side is a completely top-down approach. In my business unit, the leadership team care only about the bottom line. You don't have value unless you work days and nights on billable projects; poor communication mixes with unreasonable expectations.

Pros
Large organisation with large name clients, can lead to good exposure.
Very good job security especially for Graduates / Entry-level positions
Some great and very intelligent people work here.
Cons
Pay is very low compared to a lot of other names in the industries IBM operates in.
Operates more as a lose bundle of companies held together under one banner than a true unified company with a single vision and strategy.
Partners often never 'put pen to paper' and are often just using IBM as an easy to get into transitional job before moving elsewhere.
Slow progression of both salary and responsibility.
Currently going through a split and focusing purely on a cloud and consulting model - not sure they will be able to compete with others in these fields.
Lots of bureaucracy as you'd expect with such a large organisation.

","Maybe depends on where you work since it is a big company, but coming out of school my expectations of a tech company and what I've experience thus far at IBM were very different. I occasionally feel that IBM is behind with the times in some aspects and long term vision is unclear to me. Tech seems archaic. Pay rises aren't great and annual bonuses are almost insultingly low if you're lucky to get one. Doesn't really incentive young people to stay in my opinion, though there are plenty of IBM lifers...

Pros
The other IBMers you work with are usually talented, friendly people always willing to help.

Flexible hours are favourable, however the vast majority of IBMers work far longer than their contracted hours to get their heavy workload done.
Cons
The company is in a loop of ""resource actions"" constantly cutting headcount, even in successful and strategic areas such as AI. The morale amongst my peers is the lowest I've ever known it with concern on where the axe will drop next, as cuts are not tied to personal performance so no-one is safe.

Due to constantly reducing headcount while not reducing (and even increasing) workload employees can end up doing the job several people at once. Executives do not reduce expectations when team sizes are reduced, and act with surprise and disappointment if the remaining team doesn't deliver what the old team would have struggled to achieve.
Advice to Management
Stop saying one thing while doing the opposite. If you're investing in AI and cloud then stop reducing headcount and closing development locations. 

Start listening to your customers on what they want, instead of trying to force them to use your platform if they want your software. If they don't like the platform there are plenty of competitive products that they can go to instead.

2021-02-18, Project Manager,Calcutta,"Current Employee, more than 5 years",Good work-life balance but lack of career growth opportunity...,"1. Good Work-life balance. The organization culture promotes ""trust"" among employers and employees. These are much better compared to any peer Indian IT Service organizations.

2. Excellent learning culture. The organization provides and promotes (including financial support) for learning and growth (including external learnings) for individuals. There are many facilities to upskill and upgrade. Any proactive individual can easily utilize these opportunities to upgrade him/herself. (Most of the cases - organization assistances are no strings attached like 'approval only when a customer wants' which is stickily followed by many other Indian IT Service Organizations)

3. Promotes diversity in a big way. This organization is very good for woman employees as many of its policies and approach are favorable to them. 

4. This is an organization where people stay longer. (specially for those who love to be in a comfort zone)
","1. Lack of Growth for an individual career. Management does not promote a growth mindset. The compensation and yearly hikes are much lesser compared to the market standard. The management encourages mediocrity. This results in a lack of innovation and agility. (though the organization claims otherwise in 'talks')

2. Top heavy organization and incompetent management. Processes are highly bureaucratic, slow, and complex. Too many hierarchies. Everyone seems to be highly insecure and lacks the courage and conviction to make the right decision on the top. CxO level strategy changes too frequently.

3. Most pathetic medical insurance for Indian employees especially if anyone has aged-dependent parents to take care of. (compared to medical insurance provided by other Indian employers)

2021-02-17, Project Manager,"Research Triangle Park, NC",Former Employee,Disorganized and Run By Dinosaurs,"Lots of smart colleagues. Attracts talent due to name recognition, commercials...?
","Sizable gap between the sunshine spread by C level execs versus the reality of first/second line managers. In my last position, C level said one thing and then first line manager completely disregarded the overall strategy including skills needed for team. The layoff cycle is constant. It's tiresome. No one feels valued. No job security.
Advice to Management
Stop the layoffs. These are indicators of really poor executive management. Why would talent want to join a layoff shop? Also, THOROUGHLY monitor first line managers to make sure strategy, skills are being implemented and embraced. A dinosaur manager just laid me off because I got certified in skills heavily touted by C level. This happened to someone else on my team, too.

Cons
for a process-driven organization, some processes are dreadful... took me a week to get a new mac when mine stopped working... need an adapter for an external screen.. its been 2 weeks and still, they are working out a correct cost code it needs to be billed to.. (69 euros worth!?). The bullying policy is not existing if your manager is a friend with the second line manager... 4 people complained to HR about one specific manager and noting has been done about it.
Advice to Management
My team is great but I see other teams struggle with managers who are micromanaging them, taking their work and claim as their own, they are bullies and rude to their employees. Their family struggles are reminded to them and reflected in their check point reviews. This is not for all managers but HR should keep a close look if an employee complains to them about a manager...

increase the level of Salary for each band. Work life balance is a myth here in IBM now, no good plan of taking planned leave. Leave plan depends on manager and not on the HR policy. However IBM originally has the best HR policy. ideally one of the best and secure place to work which is getting hampered by some unskilled managers and low package comparing with the market.

6. Worldwide opportunities for those keen to move
7. High integrity at the core values
Cons
1. Salary is lower than market average
2. Ridiculously small salary increases
3. Nebulous promotion criteria (more politics than merit) that changes often (and you are always behind)
4. New hires make more money than people with same skills and responsibilities (no much financial reward on experience/skills developed) - If you've accepted a lower salary when hired, you will most likely take 10+ years to fix it (most people leave within 2 years)
5. Not the better reputation in Australia (company) and lots of bad attitude from client staff, independent contractors and even ex-IBMers
6. Lots of ""clans"" and political animals who survive (and make lot of money) just ""talking their way"" and doing very little.
7. Unfortunately not the company people think it is (not anymore)
8. No matter what extraordinary contributions you've made during your time, you may be made redundant at any time without any compelling reason (or explanation)

Pros
Undergoing great (believable) transformation, pro-diversity, being at the forefront of IT development, great access to information (this is a huge), too big to fail.
Cons
Not nimble or even Agile enough, trying to balance the Watson's legacy of providing security to employees with the necessary turnover of the IT business - and giving too much focus on sales people, band 6-8 career progression gap, having a vague evaluation process. Still lacking strong cultural change, away from the ""this is how things go around here"" mindset.
Advice to Management
Have our executives list a few of our strategic mistakes (it's become a healthy practice), force 360 evaluation process (who knows what feedback I have regarding my superiors which I fear telling them?) - i.e. favor transparency, set a goal for achieving radical transparency at least among top-management. Maybe have our collaborators being tested on the Agile Manifesto randomly.

Advice to Management
IBM is too siloed: it is historical and by design, there is a good business reason which is not relevant here. I saw evidence that there is an effort to change this in my time there but it was also in fact how I found my value, easily working across business units (silo's) to get the process fixed or remove redundancies, my issue was recording or proving it. Ever ready with a label IBM calls people like me 'wild ducks' and they admit that we are harder to manage because we at times work against the 'normal' that has made IBM so strong. 

For example, on paper I am an extremely average employee, success factors just could not capture my achievement. So when my manager had to cut a whole team in a redundancy action and let all 16 of us go those of us without perfect SAP records, or good senior friends suffered in the scramble for jobs that occurs every year in 'redundancy season'! It was a sound business decision as we were a mobile team of floating resources, that when not utilized hurt the bottom line of our department! There were only 4 casualties and losing the whole team gone eliminated a potential budget risk of $34,000 per month, a smart move especially 9 months before COVID lockdown in March 2020 when most of us would have been benched quickly. However, I am trying to show this not as a complaint but an observation on how even with a sound process, there is collateral damage! 

Neither my manager nor I managed to retain a copy of page 1 of my redundancy letter in the whirlwind of activity that was my departure. It was a Friday and I had finished my tasks on a project, while I could and perhaps should have hung around for another week but I took the responsible approach and handed over the simple remaining tasks. The project was being cut by about 30 staff and for me, it had been an interesting gap filler! 

I left thinking it was time to look for my next! I messaged my manager to let him know I needed to find another project but was leaving a little early as I had wrapped up efficiently. He insisted on seeing me that day, I was tired and tried to get out of it but it could not wait! The reason he could not wait? He was serving me a redundancy notice and if he waited till the next Monday it would be a new month and I would qualify for an extra months pay! As I said the process was followed but there was no humanism in it. 

It might make sense to most of us, even me a month salary saved is a good brownie point with his boss but it's not the big picture of the individual affected or me! This lack of humane involvement in the process is why my rating of this company has dropped substantially since me employed review. I shall try to briefly explain why I feel poorly dealt with and why I blame a process not a person.

Not seeing the cost savings of my last automation project mentioned above I can only estimate 2-3 CPA qualified FTE were reassigned, I hope! However on the project before as it's the leader I had earned the company more money than they would pay me in 355+ years, at my current rate. Perhaps not a fantastic accomplishment considering where I got the opportunity from, but when I was learning about the world of work last century it would have earned some kind of retention bonus for accomplishment! They never trained me in sales, or design I learned on the job; it could be said they tempted me out of HR to sell and design a product a client was insisting on and then left me to my own devices knowing they had no the intention to market my newly designed product, it was not profitable enough! 

It was not a design flaw it was a flaw in the process, you see nobody could confirm that in 7 years in an HR cost centre I had saved or recovered more money than I was paid, not like the above sample but perhaps 150% of my total salary! Sadly peanuts in the Global Business Service world which meant it wasn't even relevant! If I had fought it and raised these issue I would have struggled with proof and it would be argued I should have recorded this more clearly in SAP success factors, and yes I would agree! Though I was constantly getting edited by managers who did not want to increase my pay with repeated professional assessment increases! 

Siloed was my original point because working across business unit's with ease is what multinationals need, people who ask why an HR mobility team needs a full financial report if we only report details in QBR's internally, getting the initial report from the system meant time saved and no process miss as we did not need all the supporting documents! Moving across BU's means the requirement's at times even the relevance of your activity changes in importance it's really hard to keep track and protect yourself. 

My point is this if you decide to work at IBM retain facts of everything you do ask your manager about your contribution, get a confirmation note. Ask each quarter how should you show progress and achievement at your end of the year, it's important people move a lot if you wait for 6-11months you may have a new manager who can not answer you! 

My advice to managers is talking to your managers until someone is talking to Arvind Krishna and convince him that if you want to have wild ducks who are perhaps not brilliant but are above average then more time must be spent coaching, building employee accomplishment not brushing them under the carpet.

2021-02-12, Project Lead,,"Former Employee, more than 8 years",Big Name company where it is difficult to grow unless you have contacts,"Large company. Plenty of opportunities to upskill and reskill. Excellent training resources.Flexible hours.
","Difficult to grow due to bureaucratic nature of company. Very political when it comes to managers who control everything when it comes to your career. Resource managers are the absolute worst who will try to assign you to any project irrespective of your skill or seniority and are not willing to put in any effort to help you get a project, position or location of your choice. It does not matter if you have been rated highly throughout your career there for them. They will try to assign you to the first project available and if you say no, they will escalate the matter. Despite having locations in every country, it is nearly impossible to to get opportunities where you want to go because of the rigid country based structure. For almost every other IT company, it is easy to move to a country that you want to move to if they have a branch there.
Advice to Management
If a resource has been rated highly every year then at least be reciprocative to their aspirations and make efforts for them to be able to meet them by not having to leave the company

2021-02-11, Advisory Systems Analyst,Calcutta,"Former Employee, more than 5 years",Nice to retire from,"Flexible timings, can opt for full time work from home if negotiated properly. The clients are stable and being running for long duration. Has its own framework of certification program which are recognized since it has a Brand associated with it. Better job stability as in case resources get released from one account can be allocated to other account
","Lack of projects with good technology stack. The clients are relatively running their services for long and older platforms. Salary hike is almost neglible which I think is the same for all other IT services company. But there can be situation where one can get 0 % hike as well. Onsite opportunities are the least as they have establishmet in all geographic location. The HR system is opaque so for any unforseen situation, getting a neutral help is very difficult. The appraisal process is very difficult to understand, so you don't really understand whether you are getting a good rating or not.
Advice to Management
Try to work on getting clients from competitive sectors so the technology growth happens within the organization. Work on engaging in providing advanced solutions.

","Pay - If you are a motivated and industrious hard worker, you are better off elsewhere. Socialized earnings - top and bottom not much difference. Better have a manager who will fight for your commissions. I continually blew out my quota but was given retroactive quota increases - that resulted in negative commission checks! Yes - I am being serious. Explanation: ""Since you do so well and were paid in the bonus in the previous quarter, with the increased quota, you were actually overpaid ... so you owe us money."" They never made you pay it and tried to make it sound like you were being done a favor when it was 'wiped clean' at the beginning of the next year. Net net - they fund you not off the dollars you sell but at a percentage of your salary. Go someplace that pays you for what you actually sell at a guaranteed rate.
