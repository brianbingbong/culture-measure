2020-12-04, Data Scientist,"San Jose, CA",Former Employee,"Superior Work Life Balance, Frustrating Bureaucracy","Cisco has always had female leadership presence and because of that, the company takes work life balance very seriously. Also, because they invented telecommuting, that lifestyle is built into their DNA. Almost everyone I worked with was excellent. When we got our red tape out of the way, we did a lot of cool stuff.
","The company is gigantic. This primarily manifests itself in 2 ways: Layoffs and Bureaucratic Slowdown. Cisco pretty much has a standard policy of cutting 10% of the workforce every, single, year. A lot times the layoffs make ZERO sense at all, and people often get rehired at higher salaries. It's almost a Silicon Valley tradition to be laid off off from Cisco at some point in your career. From a software/Data Science perspective, the red tape primarily shows itself in data access. Finding the right data steward and actually completing data permissions is a frustrating and circuitous process. But, on the other hand, red tape slows things down so much it's pretty rare to get overwhelmed.

We talk about how we offer an end-to-end solution, but when it comes to sales, deployment, and even post-sales support everything is extremely silo'd. Have a multi-architectures solution?

I worked out of the Meraki office and really liked all of my co-workers in the building and the culture that was built there. We initially had really good dynamic, and for a period of time I really enjoyed my day to day. Over time, we had a series of leadership changes, acquisitions, and after nearly a dozen manager changes in a few short years and an exodus of talent, my team became a shell of what it formerly was. I had great experiences finding other ways to involve myself in the Cisco community that led to a lot of amazing new connections and opportunities that I will forever be grateful for. Cisco has abundant opportunities outside of your immediate org if you are motivated and ask to be involved. There were a lot of amazing upsides to Cisco, but my immediate BU was horribly mismanaged.

2020-10-28, Financial Analyst ,"Research Triangle Park, NC","Current Employee, more than 1 year",Great Spot to Start Your Career,"-The rotational aspect of the program is great in that you can experience 4 very different roles over the course of 2 years, which is great for trying to understand a company as large as Cisco. The variety of roles is clearly a plus as you are able to preference which areas interest you as you move throughout your time in the program. -Generally, the expectations from your teams are within reason but provide a challenge at least in my experience. Learning is encouraged and mistakes are seen as an opportunity to grow rather than a reason for criticism. -The program itself feels like a family of sorts that you can relate with people in the same boat as yourself early in career. This makes for a great support system and provides an automatic resource for general questions.
","-Sometimes timing of role responsibilities and additional program expectations can overlap which can create a challenge; however, these are chances to exercise time management. -Transitions can be a little tricky to manage due to turnover of roles (some new ones can be added and others) so some processes aren't as clearly defined. Generally business partners are understanding though and there's always help to get you up to speed.

2020-10-26, Customer Support Engineer III,"Research Triangle Park, NC","Current Employee, more than 5 years","Great People, Great Products, Great Company, but still a large corporation...",PROS: -- Positive Work environment / Corporate Culture. -- ,"ant Exposure to New Technology. -- Endless opportunities to develop existing skills, learn new skills on the job, and change roles. -- Leadership is dedicated to making the company feel like one large ""team"" or ""family"" where everyone is there to help everyone else (not always practiced of course). -- An extremely well organized and streamlined company. -- Company culture heavily promotes internal-innovation and is very open to hearing about (and trying out) ideas of employees if they are innovative, reasonable, doable, and the employee is willing to make them a reality. -- Technical ability and breadth of technical knowledge are prized commodities company-wide, even among non-technical roles, and often go hand-in-hand with opportunities for personal development and advancement. -- Positive attitudes are well rewarded and those with a consistently negative outlook often find themselves a victim of the Annual ""limited restructuring"" events. -- The annual layoffs do not usually impact technical workers (and their supporting coworkers) that are focused on growing / profitable technologies and products. -- In contrast to media speculation and Lamentations following layoffs on web forums, these layoffs are almost entirely avoidable. With the deluge of resources to learn new technologies and skills within Cisco, workers who find themselves layed off when their area of focus is no longer relevant (profitable) almost always passed up many opportunities to reskill, move into growing tech, etc. And the writing is always on the wall well before the axe falls. NOTE: there ARE exceptions to this like when huge portions of staff at one of the Cisco sites is let go for heartless business reasons -- such as when jobs are moved overseas to save money (or when jobs are moved back because customers prefer to ""speak to someone in ""). -- Cisco gives you a choice of several nice notebook models to use (including the current year MacBook Pro 15"") as well as quality monitors and computer peripherals for your daily use. This is a nice perk if you're a bit of a nerd, which many employees are.
Cons
CONS: -- The (very) regular restructuring / layoff events. There really MUST be a less heartless and less disheartening way of aligning human resources with ever-changing corporate goals and fluctuations in stock prices. The current method of mass purges every year can't really be called anything other than lazy and uninspired leadership with a near-sighted view of success. For a company that so prizes innovation this practice sticks out like a sore thumb. -- Oftentimes employees are dramatically underpaid for their work. Sadly, since many of these workers started with the company fresh out of college as interns, after 10+ years they will often find themselves making half of what an employee at another company with identical skills and experience makes. Since Cisco does not really ever give employees more than a few percent pay increase per year, many of these seasoned workers are trapped in a low paying position with no real hope of receiving a fair wage without leaving the company, accepting a (much) higher position at another company, and reapplying at Cisco a year or so later, at which point Cisco will match (or offer a slightly higher) wage than the worker is currently being paid. Situations like this really show that at the end of the day, a giant corporation that genuinely cares about its workers well-being, is still a giant corporation. -- The Annual layoffs -- Even when an employee is paid something close to fair market value for a specific role, the pay is typically lower than what the vast majority of other organizations will pay, and the benefits (once amazing beyond compare!) are very middle of the road. -- The annual layoffs -- Unless a candidate is truly an industry leader or posseses unique skills Cisco cannot find elsewhere, there is no real room for negotiating pay / an employment contract. If the candidate attempts to negotiate after an offer has been made and rejects the initial offer, that's the end of the ball game. The hiring manager will go on down the list of the fifty other perfectly qualified candidates and offer the job to one of them. This regular practice has cost many candidates a job when they were simply following normal, acceptable job-seeker etiquette. The unstated (but commonly understood) idea behind this behaviour is that working for a great company like Cisco is a highly valuable reward in itself, and the difference in pay is accounting for that ""fact"" -- I have never heard of anyone telling this to a candidate but I have heard managers on a number of occasion allude to this. -- The annual layoffs -- The company was founded in Californis and has always been based in California. For those who do not know, this region of the US known is known for its very strong progressive and left-leaning social and political beliefs. And while almost always a good thing, the imprint the area in which Cisco is located oftentimes makes leadership announcements, company initiatives, etc. a little bit preachy and ""holier-than-thou"" -- looking down on those who do not always agree with Cisco's political or social stances on certain topics. -- The annual layoffs. I am taking to YOU, CHUCK ROBBINS, please fix this for the sake of your loyal employees, you're so much better than this.

There are plenty of job swap opportunities throughout your entire career at Cisco. Typically, employees try to rotate to grow their skillsets about every 2-4 years. Also, because Cisco is such a large company, no role is the same. You have plenty of opportunities to learn something new and develop in new areas both personally and professionally.

No on the same page but the big bonus's stay the same. They also contradict each other. Our SVP said to focus on quality and a group meeting. The next week the group VP said focus on time to market not quality, the exact opposite. You tend to get siloed and management does not seem able to figure out get workers access to the numerous training programs or worse this lack of access is intentional. Tell your manager to figure out how to get access to ""Chuck"" bucks for training. Intergroup working relationships can be difficult probably due to the Cisco HR stacked ranking mechanism. People do not want to help out when integrating different products/functionality together. Definite ageism in labor reduction practices. Buy other companies then start killing the product even when still achieving 20% growth. I'm sure the tier 1 telco's are going to be happy about that.

Most of the managers are great people who provide guidance and try to help you determine your career path and put you on projects you would enjoy and your skills align to (there is always a ""bad apple"" manager, but this is the exception).
","The IT side in particular seems to be following what I consider a negative trend in the industry of hiring contractors for specific projects with the skills needed, rather than training the full time employees they already have who have gotten the company to the successful state they are in. You won't get the best talent using primarily contractors and they will leave eventually.

2020-09-09, Customer Success Specialist,,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",Technical adoption in a young part of the organization,"A Customer Success Specialist (CSS) is a technical person, who is given the task of acting as a technical consultant for customers, in the post-sales stage. The goal is helping customer with product adoption. The daily job is a mix of studying/practicing with the technology, on one side, and engaging with customers in meetings and workshop, on the other: so, it's a very interesting mix between technical and ""soft"" skills. It's particularly indicated for technical people who have a passion for explaining, helping, engaging with people. It's the ideal position for people with a strong technical background, who wish to move a little bit towards the business and the communications side of the IT work. The Customer Success organization in Cisco is still very young, which gives an opportunity to stay in an enthusiastic environment and to shape the organization, because many processes still need to be finalized. At the same time, it's a growing part of the company, because Cisco's vision is to focus more and more on recurrent revenues, and therefore on subscription renewal, and therefore on adoption. Being a post-sales role, there is not excessive pressure, because CSSs are not measured in relation to a sales quota. This gives time to learn, and to establish a good life/work balance.
","The cons are exactly the other side of the coin, if compared to the pros. E.g.: Since Customer Success is a young organization, things are changing very often: the management is changing ideas and adjusting the strategy very frequently. This is not ideal for people who like to stay on a solid ground, or to be constantly told what to do. Another example: since the role is post-sales and not bound to sales quotas, as a result the compensation and the incentives won't be so high as in a sales role. But, in turn, you get lower pressure and stress.

2020-09-04, Customer Success Specialist,Madrid,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",Great company to work and grow,"Cisco Systems is one of the top companies in the industry and hence it's a company where you can develop a successful and stable career. In Cisco you are always challenged to grow and improve, you have plenty of opportunities to develop yourself as well as opportunities to move internally between different positions. And when doing so, you'll normally get the full support of your manager. In cisco everyone is approachable: it is not uncommon that you can take a coffee with one of the executives and hjave an open conversation and share what you think about the company and about your role: they actually like to receive such feedback and information. But also at lower level, your voice is always heard and your feedback taken into consideration. It's also a company you can feel proud of, thanks to all the initiatives the employees and the company work on to give back to the society, and that are supported and encouraged by the executives in the company, starting from the CEO: giving back, corporate social responsibility, fairness and equal treatment, work-life balance, ... Finally, compensation in the company is really good, and there are plenty of benefits you can enjoy that add on top of your salary.
","As mentioned, there are plenty of opportunities to promote in Cisco, but you have to pursue them by yourself: just doing your job will not grant you a promotion to a higher position, and career path is not pre-established...if you want to move to a higher position you have to apply and demonstrate you are the best candidate for it. That can also be a benefit, as there is not a minimum time you have to be in a position to promote. Being a multinational company also means that your manager might not be in your same country, which can make the promotion even harder. Also, your workmates can be spread around the globe too. And sometimes due tom frequent restructuring, your manager can change often. Finally, most position at Cisco are goal-driven, what means that you may end-up working extra hours very easily. Hence, very good time management and organisation skills are needed, as well as the ability to disconnect from work when the day is over, even when working from home.

2020-09-03, Program Manager,"San Jose, CA","Former Employee, more than 5 years",Great place to start and end your career,"Pay is decent but not as high as other tech companies around the area. 401k matching, fairly good health benefits, WFH and working remotely are available to most employees, but it depends on your team and manager. Its a great place to start your career but most early in career people leave to other tech companies after 2-3 years. Cisco doesn't do a good job of retaining some of their top talent. This is a perfect company for those with a family and like a lot flexibility. Most departments are pretty relaxed and hardly ever hit 40 hours of work a week
","Overall there aren't too many cons. The two biggest issues I see is a lack of merit increase each year. Some people can stay at their same salary for 5 years. Promotions are fairly hard to get if you don't play politics. Saw a lot great talent leave when they didn't get recognized. The only other major con is upper management. There are too many directors and senior leaders that care more about their bonus and don't focus on the bigger picture of doing whats best for the company.

","While Cisco is definitely on the progressive side of adapting to the modern world needs of an employee, there are a lot of older Cisco employees who have been with the organization for decades. These people can have a more 'traditional' approach to work. It is hard to separate from work as everyone is always online and available and you would be expected to do the same. A person's experience is also very dependent on the team they're on and some teams have very toxic cultures.

","Cisco is an organisation which is devoid of any genuine ethical or moral credibility. Despite the efforts they go to with their PR activity. Cisco's culture causes mental illness far too regularly. Cisco discriminate against people who have mental health issues. They are actively covering up and misrepresenting the scale of the harm their sales teams are being subjected to by wilfully discriminating both financially and through their actions, against anyone who suffers mental ill health due to the stresses of the role. Also, not enough support to avoid burnout - Always connected culture leads to burnout - likely to be harassed by sales leadership quite often including evenings and weekends. Cisco DO NOT CARE ABOUT ANY EMPLOYEE - THEY BRAINWASH THEIR WORKFORCE INTO BELIEVING THEIR SPIN.

","Cisco is a large company, and old for the tech industry, and I feel like both of those showed in the negatives. Lots of policies, lots of old corporate systems and processes that we were theoretically supposed to know how to use, and a feeling of detachment, of being several levels down in a 70,000+ node tree. Some things hadn't changed in years or decades, but there were also (from my perspective) unnecessary and disruptive changes while I was there; big changes in both health and retirement benefits providers within one year. The experience of being an employee at Cisco seemed to involve a lot of complexity that had more to do with the company's size and age than with my work or what I wanted from a job, and I would have preferred a simpler employee experience where I could focus on getting actual work done.

Pros
I have been working for Cisco for more than 2 years now. I joined Cisco straight out of college. I will forever be grateful to Cisco for helping me build myself from scratch. Even though I am here on Glassdoor looking for a job switch now, I am amused to see how high my standards have become, all because the way I am treated here at Cisco. They might not be paying me as much as I want but they sure are treating me well. > Best work culture ever. Saying this based on what I hear from friends working in other companies. > You will know they actually care about you and Cisco will go out of its way to show it to you. > Excellent leadership team, their ideas and visions flow through the entire company and keep us all on the right path. > Got to learn a lot in the past 2 years, all thanks to the management and teammates. > Satisfactory compensation.
Cons
The role that I am in is customer-facing and with a support role, comes its own challenges. Everyone knows Cisco TAC and appreciates it for the work we do. At the same time, being a TAC engineer can get exhausting for the following reasons. 1. We are supposed to work 8 hours a day but the amount of work can never be wrapped up in that time. Even though we hand off after our shifts, you will always have work pending on you. 2. Escalations may exhaust you now and then. 3. In the past 2 years that I have spent here, I have only heard of cost-cutting measures taken to save the business and keep it growing. Although I understand the decisions taken from a business point of view, but they still need to make promotions more frequent and rewarding. 4. The sheer amount of talent present in Cisco makes it very hard for you to get promoted. Doing your day-to-day job well is not good enough, you have to show the extra efforts you have put in to get promoted. This kind of challenging work environment is great for growth as long as the promotion we get justifies the efforts. 6. Seen senior talent leave for the above reason.

","At SP Routing BU in India, engineers work at least 12 hours a day, 7 days a week. There are no weekends or holidays, and you would even be indirectly asked to work on the days when you file a leave. There is no respect given for engineers, and work life balance is completely unheard of. In the days when we talk about abolishing keywords like ""Slave"" even from techical jargon, the engineers in SP India are treated as if they are ""owned"" by Cisco, and expected to be available 24x7. The entire hierarchy of senior management consists of egoistic and narcissist lot who treat engineers like some sort of tools to be used and disposed off. They dont like any engineer saying he/she is overloaded with work - that's something they hate to hear. So, engineers are expected to not complain, and just continue working on their stretch targets during their entire life, sacrificing their personal lives and health, so that the Management can claim to get more work done by less people. If anyone complains, they would be pushed back saying that we are not working ""optimally"", or we should think of ""automation"" instead of doing ""donkey's work"" etc. etc - That would certainly be not motivating at all, after working on complex technical problems. The management seems to be totally clueless when it comes to understanding the value of technical contributions of engineers, and they just go after some jargons and fancy terminologies and matrics. The main responsiblity of the Management is to use the whip and constantly apply pressure on employees to squeeze the maximum out of them, which is a strtegy that is systemically pushed down from top to bottom in the hierarchy of management. They would often be hypocritical and ""encourage"" the employees to give ""open comments"", but all they are expecting is that engineers should just ""align"" themselves with the general labor strategy and directions from top. Project schedules are dervided based on a sort of ""bargaining process"" between the engineers and management, resembling some sort of civil construction work. The engineers go with a particular effort estimate which will be outright rejected by the Management, who would want ""justifications"" for every single day projected. The implicit bargaining process results in engineers cutting down the effort projections by half, agreeing to ""absorb"" the work. Eventually, the project tends to slip, and engineers work 24x7 to meet the targets, only to get constantly criticized and tortured with sarcastic comments regarding the delays and slippage. Even though the quality of technical work done in the BU is superiod, there is never a sense of achievement, and it appears like the management constantly wants to make every engineer feel that they are failures.

The culture is great, they really let you be who you want to be. You have the guidance and support that you need but you are also given the opportunity to make the work your own.

I would also like to mention that Cisco have been fantastic throughout Covid-19, they have been understanding and respectful of each individuals situation.

Pros
I have been around a lot of large companies and I can't say I've ever seen anything close to this good. I had always been curious about working here, and I had read a LOT of negative stuff about the company. When i came here (red badge/contractor then converted to blue/FTE) i kept an open mind and tried to reserve judgement. my experience has been GREAT. It's not perfect, sure, but WHAT IS?! Great benefits great work/life payscale is good, but not top of the line for everyone. Great technology Great team members/work culture Don’t believe all the absurd doom and gloom blogs about this company. Yes, it’s part of their corporate culture to restructure and RIF, accept it and move forward. That can happen ANYWHERE!
Cons
WFH can be a double edged sword, and be isolating. Customers can be a pain and the Sales culture at Cisco can breed some real Sh*! heads, but that's not exclusive to Cisco either.

Pros
Intra-company mobility, quality of staff, solidity of business and ethical principles, benefits. If you perform, you can do very well at Cisco and get a lot of satisfaction from roles as well as interactions with great colleagues.
Cons
Sometimes over-politicized, especially at mid- to senior levels. Can get in the way of swift and efficient decision making compared to some of its peers. Unfortunately Cisco has had to stick to its bi-annual limited restructuring exercises for the past 15 years as it is constantly trying to re-invent itself towards new business models. Creates stress amongst employee base.

I know several anecdotes of male senior managers engaging in gender-discriminatory behavior & comments when it comes to compensation, growth, acknowledging achievements, and providing actionable feedback. Instead of supporting women in leadership and encouraging growth, Cisco is consistently burning woman leaders out. Go ahead and count the number of women who are at least one-level skip managers in an engineering team in Cisco. Hint - you may be able to count them on your fingertips.

Pros
- The bonuses are really good, if you work hard - Not expected to work after it's time to clock out - Weekend/Holiday pay is fantastic. You can earn so much more if you work a lot of weekends - Culture is all about being yourself, so you can be POC or LGBTQ+ and be in a welcome environment - Great benefits for health and dental, onsite medical and therapy - Certification discounts for any Cisco Certifications - Can use up all your PTO straight if you like, some people take a month off at a time - Good place to start for either those getting started in their career, or those that want to get their CCIE in a product. This is the fastest way to learn.
Cons
- You only learn the product you're meant to support, rarely the entire solution - No learning resources for the product you're supposed to support on smaller teams/products - Company is excited to promote products, then lay off team members *FOR* that product - Quarterly layoffs, but yearly promotion cycles - Weekend shifts are voluntold to you if you're on a smaller team, and aren't necessarily on a cycle (and you can expect to work every weekend. I just worked 2 months straight with 6/7 day weeks) - Business Unit/Escalation team will withhold information from TAC, which can keep us from being able to do our jobs - Any training will be sales training, and not support training, which means we won't know how to fix/tshoot problems any more than when we started. - The products we support are upsold and underdeveloped. You'll constantly find yourself saying ""that feature isn't supported until a future release, even though the buttons are there and the documentation says how to set it up. Please don't use it as it's not production ready."" - Burnout/turnover is high. It's nonstop when you work for Cisco. Don't expect to take time to study at home unless it's your passion, as everyone was usually too mentally drained at the end of the day. - Any time to study for certifications on smaller teams is impossible due to the sheer amount of work to do. On larger teams you can get time off the queue to study with management approval. Personal Experience: Was strung along for two years about a promotion, contributing to python IC and being the top case taker, but was still told ""I can't promote you yet, even though you're at a starting pay grade. Next cycle, though."" After being told that 3 times, and seeing two layoffs in two quarters, I broke out the resume. Because of all of the above, you'll find yourself working in situations where different levels of upper management will start to have daily calls on how to keep customers from pulling Cisco from their deployment, when in reality the product just wasn't ready to be sold to them.

Pros
Telecommute, worked with global team colleagues, my team always had each other's back ALWAYS.
Cons
~45% of Cisco workers are ""contingent"" (contract); the majority should be full-time employees. Too many managers are way too political and are here for their own self gains even by stepping on employees who work for them, my level of trust with most managers was low; I will say I had 2 managers I would follow to the end of world (one was a Sr Director and one was a Sr Manager - fabulous, this was 6 years ago and they are now gone, they had 20 years at Cisco). Some managers I questioned (to myself no one else) why they had their role and it was clear they had connections and were ""covered"". I've been in IT for over 25 years and Cisco is the worse I've ever seen. I have this love/hate relationship: 1) I need to telecommute (EXCELLENT) due to family; 2) Cisco treats employees as replaceable cogs (BAD) in a machine, raises may take 3-5 years to get one. Yeah, it's a right to work environment, this isn't Cuba. If I'm expected to be loyal and jump when they say jump, I expect management to do a better job of supporting their charges. Like I said, not all are bad, but too many, IMHO, are. I've been a manager and leader, and have always respected and supported my charges.

2020-01-30, Sales Director,"London, England, England",Former Employee,"Great in some ways, lame in others","Huge focus on employee wellbeing, incredibly comprehensive portfolio. Great place if work/life balance is more important to you than outright earning potential. Strong and well trusted brand.
","Like many huge corporates there is a misconception at the very top that the brand will compensate for mediocrity. Consequently many of the employees are 'lifers' not terribly interested in pushing the business forward, especially in middle and upper-middle management. Tenure is worn as a badge of honour as opposed to outright performance. Aspirations are disappointing and the way in which people are measured and driven leads to a risk averse attitude in many based around their incentivisation. For instance a sound business case for high levels of growth will be rejected more often than not in favour of minimal investment and a risk free quota. The portfolio is not always the best or even in the top 3 or 4 yet carries a 'Cisco' premium. This is particularly true where the business is looking to maximise the return on legacy products (eg Firewalls and Routing & switching). Sales are often driven hard around these 'me too' offers at the expense of the next gen innovation. A great example of this is the market move to 'Software Defined' which caught Cisco on the hop - yet the speed at which they entered the SD markets would suggest the offers were actually there, they just were not being pushed for fear of impacting existing, legacy, revenues. Given Cisco's history as a market disruptor (IPT, etc) this is really disappointing. The business has become a proper geritocracy, merit and ambition taking second place every time to tenure.

I feel I am very fairly compensated for the work I do but mostly feel a strong loyalty to Cisco for how I've been able to achieve an amazing work/life balance through taking advantage of remote working. I've always worked for managers many states away, communicating regularly but not too often, by Cisco's HD video technology. I've never been micromanaged and always been empowered to work when, where and how I choose as long as I am performing and excelling at my deliverables. This has allowed me to very successfully transition in to my new life as a working mom where unlike most of my friends I haven't had to make the choice between career and present parenting. I can truly do both, even as a breastfeeding mother and didn't have to take a single step back. Maternity leave was ridiculously generous and long enough that I actually felt excited to come back to work (especially since I work from home near my baby and nanny). The other perks for new moms that Cisco provides are over the top generous between milk stork, $100 lactation store credit, stuffed animals and baby books mailed to my home, free lactation consultant, and more. So thankful for Cisco and the wonderful career, no, wonderful LIFE, working here has afforded me. No reason I wouldn't spend my whole career here as I believe these benefits are unique to Cisco in the tech world. Speaking of the actual work I've always been empowered and encouraged to pursue new and interesting opportunities across many departments and job titles. I've always been promoted and given raises before I even thought to ask for them. Cisco has treated me really well.

Pros
The Cisco Krakow office is full of vibrant young and diverse people. The office is modern and it has all amenities you can think of. There are trainings happening all the time and opportunities to train or mentor others. Constant influx of young people with new ideas. Great work-life balance and there's an investment from the company in activities for employees outside of work. Lots of flexibility and possibility of partial remote work. For those who like travelling, there are a lot of opportunities to do so in projects.
Cons
No relevant salary progression, especially for juniors. People can be stuck with their initial junior position/salary for up to 2 years. Even though after a year these juniors are often taking projects by themselves and travelling to the customer representing the company alone. This results in lower employee retention. A lot of people leave after 1-2 years as other companies will give substantial pay increases. Software is a rather young department at cisco. While the networking department is often full of incredibly experienced engineers that have really deep networking knowledge, the software department is often filled with networking engineers that have no software background and that go to a couple of programming trainings (mostly python) to develop/support software. It's not a good place to work at if you want to become a better software engineer. Due to the rapid growth of the company in Krakow, a lot of managers that are hired that have no managerial experience. On top of that, they're often picked from the current senior engineers who not always have the necessary people skills, even if they're great technically. So there's a high chance you might have a bad experience with your direct manager.

And if you don’t laugh, you’re just not spiritual enough. I once witnessed a coleague on the balcony, that was wearing a gorgeous dress, being ridiculed that she should just come naked to work. It’s not easier for men either. It’s an office culture of bullying, where if you don’t subscribe to toxic masculinity beliefs, you are belittled as a coleague and as a man. To top it off, Senior Management shares far right articles on the internal chat, literally saying that white men are underpriviledged in this day and age. It would be mesmerising if it wasn’t all true. Stay away from this office/team if you’re a ballanced individual.

A big company can suffer some bad managers. Changes too often to be stable in marketplace, be prepared for change. Pays lip service to programs and often only succeeds because of 1 or 2 dedicated individuals. If those individuals go, then the programs often go too.

Recently there is a lot of talk about AI and some teams are using it, others are exploring options. Benefits are good, four weeks of vacation, accrued PTO, not ""unlimited"" like in many companies, 4.5 % match on 401K contributions, bonus, better health insurance than many companies, ESPP - you can save up to 10% of salary to buy stock with at least 15% discount. Cisco gives the lowest price for last 2 years (on ESPP buy dates) minus 15%, nice. In most teams work/life balance is good. It's possible to work on really big projects and products that most of startups can't handle.
","It's a huge company, so there is more ""paperwork"" than in startups, reporting hours spent, creating and closing user stories and tickets... Also, there are slackers, and for long time those people can go by with doing almost nothing just because they are friends with their manager. Cisco has quarterly layoffs, usually small, once a year, in September to November a big one. Regardless of how much you contribute you may be let go just because the business unit is not as profitable as some others.

Pros
The work-life balance is superb. I am a mother of 3 and as an engineer I have a great team and great company that support me especially when the unexpected happens or I need to leave. The execs are so supportive and are easily reachable which is surprising to me considering the size of the company. I just always imagined the execs would be so busy and wouldn't really interact with those of us who are lower in the company. How wrong could I be? They are so down to earth and always willing to talk and to help in any way.
Cons
Sometimes it may be hard to figure out how to advance in a company so big so I'd just say to always talk with management about your goals and get a mentor that will help you as well.

2019-10-01,Anonymous,Chennai,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",Untrustworthy and Unfair,"At the level of policies(leave, compensation, benefits, bonus) this is one of the best companies to work for.
","Engineers in India are treated as second class citizens by some managers. If the manager doesn't feel comfortable with you(for some reason that he alone knows) and would like to exclude you he will play with your weaknesses rather than with your strengths. This is how its done. Its bit tricky but neatly done. Have patience to read. 'Certain people' will be allowed to work on technologies they already know of (at least to certain extent). Those 'certain people' will be given a good edge on the product knowledge, exposure to other teams, technical discussions, requirements etc., 'Other guys'(the second class citizens) will be given tasks on the technologies that they do not know. The timeline will also be short and the requirements will not be detailed enough. The 'Other guys' will need to go behind the 'Certain people' for the details. This will be like you're in mid of a dark forest. No one will ask whether you know the technology or not. Nobody will care whether you're interested to work on that or not. You'll simply be forced to do that. In a nutshell you'll be given work in a technology that you do not know, requirements that are not detailed enough and in a short timeline. If you're unable to do this that will be considered as a weakness and will be taken as a good reason for not giving you opportunity to work on technologies that you already know of, interested in and in which you've already proved your skills. The funny part is that the manager himself will not know the technology but he will stamp others who do not know the technology as weak guys and exclude them. Even when you express your areas of interest that will not be considered as 'Certain people' are already working on that. This double standard is so worse that if nobody in 'Certain people' available to do a work in a technology known to 'Other guys', it will be done even by some other team but never be given to 'Other guys' who belong to the same team. Ultimately, what manager wants out of you is the demotivation and he'll get that eventually. The 'Other guys' must work on the spill over work of the 'Certain people'. Thats what ultimately needed. I certainly don't understand why they recruit engineers in India and try so much hard to exclude them and deliver a crystal clear message that you are not here to do a job that you like to do. Your passion and interests doesn't matter. Moreover, false promises on opportunities will be given by the manager on some holiday trip which he forgets as soon as he leaves the city. So, do not trust the promises. The faith will go in vain for sure. In a nutshell, do better research on the team you're joining. Otherwise, you may regret it and leave soon.

In other words, there is NO shortage of cool stuff to do besides your day to day (which time you can manage on your own anyway). We're not just a networking company anymore, we're a technology company and yes it's a bit hard to get into the family, because we want the best skillsets and culture fits, but once you do, you'll be set for life!
","For your own initiatives, there is a defined budget (In my case it's about a thousand dollars a month) for you to travel places, pay for your hotels, meals and go execute on what you want or need to do for your job. This budget keeps employees grounded on the initiatives because if you want to do many activities, lunches, trainings, events, etc you're going to need to spend quite some money. Because the budget is set to a fixed amount you might feel constrained.

I joined through Cisco Sales Associate Programme (CSAP). Here are a few highlights of my journey so far: 1. Being a fresher, I think CSAP shaped me to face challenges in everyday work and deal creatively with them as they come. A blend of classroom and On-the-Job training makes it such an enriching experience. 2. Its a place where you feel valued everyday and know that your work matters. 3. A whole ecosystem of support to help you anytime. 4. Its an extended family. A very motivated work environment makes you want to put your best foot forward. 5. Its an extremely collaborative environment where you work not only with locally placed teams but also with teams spread geographically! It enhances your experience all the more. 5. Its all work and so much more fun! Regular small activities, team building events, off-sites and get togethers ensure that you don't burn out and enjoy your work equally much!
","Like any other large organisation, there are constant leadership changes and internal restructuring which requires you to be an your toes and stay abreast of latest developments all the time. It grooms you in a certain way but might also cost you if you don't know how to deal with constant change.

As an engineer, this environment is very exciting and always feel fun to have been in the leading tech company.

2019-09-24, Associate Account Manager,,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",Strong giving culture,"Cisco encourages their employees to give back to community in every way possible. They give 5 days every year to all their employees to give back to a charity on the trusted list. Cisco cares about the health and well-being of their employees, but it's dependent on the location and region. Cisco encourages also to develop their employees professionally and personally, by offering learning courses on discounted prices through their internal program learning @ Cisco. Cisco allows relocating to a different region when possible. There are endless opportunities to learn and develop within Cisco, some are free and some are paid for. However personal and professional growth is granted when you join Cisco.
","Office politics within certain regions is unhealthy and impacts on the employee's mental health. Certain managers hires from within their nationalities and bring their favorite friends within their own management circles . Sales can be very tough and harsh for no reasons sometimes, just to prove that the manager has the upper hand & control on everything. Not all sales employees are fairly treated, I witnessed some are holding higher targets on low grades, while some are holding small targets on high grade, and the compensation difference is around 40% less for the people with low grades

2019-09-24, Partner Account Manager,,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",Cisco Sales Associate Program,"One of the best things about working at Cisco is the friendships you make along the way. I had the opportunity to be part of a Cisco Sales Associate Program when I first joined Cisco. This program was a yearlong, worked alongside 50 other CSAPers from different countries and had 3 months intensive training followed by 9 months on-the-job training, working remotely with virtual teams. The wealth of experience I gathered on the job is extensive. Asides from being knee-deep in the technology and sales of that technology, I worked in the regional hub with teams of people from varying background and cultural experiences; this broadened my perspective to career and life. This experience I must say kick off my career. I am definitely a better employee because of this. If you are ever considering joining the CSAP program, my advice is jump right in. The initial days will be tough, stressful, annoying, but it is definitely worth it.
","Expect that the kind of culture you get from your cohort/ CSAP hub will change, depending on the country/hub you move to after the end of the program. Some of the fantastic culture you are you used to looses panache; this is common when you move from a larger hub to a much smaller one.

Pros
This is a wonderful place to boost your experience - it might be technical or non-technical. In all cases you will find something for you. When it comes to carrier boosting - it depends. Cisco is a company of ""visibilities"" and ""egoism"" - if you do the right things, you will get your promotion, otherwise you will ""die"" in humble circumstances and nobody will sorrow about it. If you are a student, less than 30 years old, have no family, you have a passion for technology so strong, that you are ready to work overtime (of course for free) - this place is right for you.
Cons
Here ""good job"", ""fantastic results"", ""keep up"" phrases mean nothing, at least for management. Cisco is a cruel and bloody business machine. You can rag to riches to rag in few months if you do or don't do the right things. You may work very well, receiving glorious feedbacks from Customers - all it is taken for granted. You will not see promotion unless you make something really fabulous, thus you will be noticed by Top Management - for example you will visit CiscoLive with your own presentation. Practically it is an easy and very dainty way for Tech Leads, since they are not expected to work ""on shift"" all the day long. Tech Leads of course supposed to have other responsibilities being an escalation, but who cares that they don't - management adopted a laissez-faire attitude long time ago. As a result bum engineers trample over each other just to get to TechLead paradise. All above is about Cisco TAC/HTTS and at the end of the day it is my personal opinion only.

2019-09-05, Systems Engineer,"London, England, England","Current Employee, more than 3 years",First Full Time Role & Can't See Myself Moving Anywhere Else,"Cisco is without a doubt one of the best companies to work for. Be it where we work, the people, the products & services we create and sell or the culture of the organisation, I have heard of very few organisations that can match the whole package that Cisco offers. As an employee of Cisco I have been able to work from home, I can work flexible hours, I get to work on the move, I've been fortunate enough to travel (a lot). The key here being that Cisco is extremely catering to the way you work and they adapt to that. Being a systems engineer in sales my work is flexible, although I regularly see other engineers being given their own space to relax and even get pizza every Friday for lunch! Within Cisco I met more cultures, nationalities, religions and diversities than I ever had before. There are regular inclusion and diversity events, we have early in career events regularly and on the whole. The vast majority of individuals you meet are interested in you and always looking to help. I regularly message colleagues for help and advice and have never been disappointed. I believe this is one of the key aspects of the culture at Cisco. Being an engineer I love the technology, I am excited working with the industry leading products and how our leaders are redefining the industry. This is a very personal pro for me, however I am sure other 'techies' reading this will agree, but for me you have to be interested in what you do and Cisco's technology helps me do that. I touched on the culture earlier. We are extremely lucky to the 'Our People Deal', and a whole host of individuals who strive to make Cisco a fantastic place to work. Be it a day off on your birthday, or the flexibility when it comes to working, Cisco's culture is something I truly love about working here. Whilst every company has its ups and downs, I have no intention of moving away from Cisco any time soon.
","Whilst there is bountiful opportunities to progress/get promoted, promotions can feel more like a 'round robin' as opposed to who is performing at the highest level at that moment and time. I believe this is a problem of all companies, however the advice is generally do not get too comfortable, continue to push yourself into different roles and you will progress. Staying in the same role will leave you slightly stagnated. Upper management in Cisco is phenomenal, we have an unbelievable CEO and C-Suite who constantly inspire you to do more. Unfortunately as with any company, it takes time for the good of the senior management to trickle down to mid-management. Again as with any company this is to be expected, whilst frustrating to be managed by people who perhaps again because of time served, rather than there because of skill. Thankfully Cisco is a constantly changing and adapting company and you find that management has to adapt as well. Being a Systems Engineer can feel like a thankless role at times within the company, but the opportunity to work with cutting edge technology and the culture in the company far far far outweigh this. Generally it is accepted that Cisco pays slightly less than others in the industry, however given the job security, additional benefits like health care, pension etc etc, I have always been happy with my pay.

2019-09-05, Sales Manager,"London, England, England","Current Employee, more than 5 years",Cisco has accelerated my career & improved daily life,"Caring employer with a culture of valuing people; the impact of our technology on society, and the positive brand recognition from our customers; pace of change and innovation; limitless career opportunities in various roles, functions and countries; competitive pay and benefits... list goes on. I meet people every day who bounced around jobs before landing and staying at Cisco. And also people who leave for greener grass on the other side, and come right back
","Big company with associated complexities and messy back-end data sets; not a consumer brand so not recognized by students and prospective candidates - makes it harder than it should to hire top talent.

Webex meetings and teams, and our personal video devices make any remote worker feel like they're one cubicle over from anyone they need help from. Hands down, a world class company to work for!

The culture is very supportive - not only on the professional, but also on the private life.

If you prefer to have a detailed description and predefined steps what you have to do - Cisco is probably not the right company for you.

I started Cisco 5-years ago through the CSAP program and over the last 5-years I've grown personally, technically and professionally more than I could've imagined ever doing anywhere else.

","When I started at Cisco, they were still doing the free drinks, free food, and beer parties on Friday. That went away as soon as the downturn started, and then the layoffs began shortly thereafter. The first couple of years they laid off the bad people, and then there weren't any bad people left, so they just started flailing the axe at random. Every year around late summer, it swings again, so everyone is just sitting in dread waiting to see who goes. Then, afterwards, you have to try to figure out how to get things done when important pieces of your team aren't there anymore. It's still an okay place to work, and the people who are left below upper management are all great. I wouldn't tell you not to take a job there, but be aware that you're going to spend every summer wondering whether you'll have a job in the fall.

Pros
Great Work culture . Flexible timings ( not applicable for some TAC engineers ). A lot of stress on learning ( Some BUs like CX have training sessions scheduled for the first 6 months and expect CCNA and CCNP from its engineers in this duration ) . Starting salary is the same for all new hires regardless of college .
Cons
Salary is not on par with other companies of similar stature. Huge intake . ~500 new grads every year which also means that there is not much growth opportunities for the first few years . Low/no hikes . People hired for 2020 onwards have 14 lakh RSUs which was not given to previously hired employees. Hire from a very few select colleges and hence the talent is not uniformly good .

2019-08-07, Senior Marketer,,"Former Employee, more than 8 years",Best company to work for until now - New Comms Chief disrespectful of Cisco’s Culture,"World class leadership where Chuck Robbins walks the talk. Highly respected and loved because he has demonstrated he cares about every single employee in Cisco across the globe. His emphasis on mental health and employee well being is commendable. Employees can reach out for help and he encourages that - which other company does that? Cisco has a very accomplished SLT who respect the Culture and their people. New SLT from MS for example have done remarkable things in the year they joined and are transforming the company while endearing employees - no other company operates like Cisco does. People love working here but for some of us, things changed with the recent external Comms hire.
","Cisco’s new CCO is all about herself. No alignment at the non-SLT level with Sales and Marketing. Introduced mandatory training when there are product specialists who are paid to manage those conversations. Brought on colleagues from former companies disregarding colleagues who deserved those VP level positions - she’s hired her friends has her inner circle in place. In the week Cisco let go dear colleagues, she was on a very public hiring spree announcing VP level appointments and no one was aware these positions were available. She did not provide an opportunity for existing employees to apply nor did she proactively look to promote anyone from Cisco with one exception. This is just not the Cisco way to behave in such an offensive manner when people are being let go. Not cool at all.

","Although working from home was a nice benefit, none of the great benefits you'd like to find at a Silicon Valley company like free food and other services. Definitely old school in how they run their business - which isn't a great thing for a tech co. Layoffs are pretty consistent, with a big one in the summer/fall and usually after each quarter, although at varying sizes. They always try to make it sound like it's for business reasons, but it's still surprising as Cisco seem to meeting their goals for the last few years. They typically do it so they can get rid of higher grade folks, hire lower grade folks or contractors and bank the savings. Even with nice severance packages, they net out in the positive. Middle management is horrific. After good management left, my team was left in shambles and leadership slowly drove team away one by one and then blamed everyone else. Lots of politics. Many managers will devise ways to get rid of those who don't agree with their opinions by withholding bonuses, prevent any movement to other teams, uncomfortable 1-1 conversations, etc. Also the division between FTEs and contractors is very apparent and the pay disparity is embarrassing as are the benefits (read none). This is problematic across the company as I'd guess 50% of their workforce is contractors (although they never release those numbers).

And innovation is another huge priority, which is great, as it keeps the creative juices flowing and you can really see the progress we're making. My management chain is fan-freaking-tastic. I get to work exclusively from a home office. My work schedule is really flexible and at no time do I feel like I have to sacrifice my responsibilities as a mom for my job.

","Not all Cisco divisions are created equal in terms of positive work environments. It's important to speak with current or recent employees connected to the hiring department to make sure you fully understand what you're getting into. And I'm sure Cisco isn't unique in that they don't always provide enough budget to adequately fund certain expansion initiatives. The expected results are made crystal clear, but enough resources to achieve it may not be provided.

",">> If you do not set a limit or some boundaries to Cisco in your life, the office (some Cisco guy that you do not know in some part of the world) WILL ""swallow you"". It is not a thing of being good, efficient or bad at your position. You have to remember that you are dealing with global customers and their demandings can come at whatever time. So, if you are considering Cisco, SET BOUNDARIES with your manager and whatever Cisco employee talking outside your working hours with the excuse that you or the customer are in a different timezone. >> Be careful when management uses expressions like ""customer satisfaction"", ""global visibility"" to demand something from you. It is good to help sometimes but again, remember about boundaries. >> Depending on the department where you are working on, the chances to get promoted can be really hard to achieve. My advice ? Be clear with your direct manager and if he/she does not say more than ""limited budget"", ""not a good year"", then you should consider to move asap and without hesitating. >> If you did not arrive at Cisco with minimum a grade 8, ohhh God, you are going to be really ""squeezed"" to get a promotion grade at what you are doing. >> Offices like Mexico, Belgium and US offer higher grades and promotions a lot easier than in Krakow. >> Salary is good for a single person. If your wife/girlfriend/mom/dad/dog/cat cannot work and you are economically supporting them, then I would say you have a lot more interesting offers in Krakow. (In terms of money). >> Although there are many extracurricular activities and trainings to attend at Cisco, if your department or team is overloaded, then you are not going to be able to take advantage of them.

The pros would be that you have flexibility to learn what you what. You are given the freedom to explore your talents and the managers and team encourage you to excel. You can be yourself and people respect you for that. It really is an amazing paced to work. I always feel like my team has got my back and that I can contribute to the success of the team and company.

2019-06-18, Customer Support Engineer,Kraków,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",Good benefits but are they worth it.,"- Good salary for graduate and fresh engineers. - Good benefits with private healthcare - Friendly Work From Home policies - Easy on the time management and flexible working hours - Good for millennial and possibility to create relaxing atmosphere for yourself - A lot of events for young people (Halloween, christmas and other many parties and social events for single people (no spouse allowed)) - Very good for diverse hiring and inclusion. Cisco is very good in its inclusive practices
","- Lower than market salaries for medium to high grade engineers - Due to the aforementioned fact of lower salary not a place which provide enough to sustain a family with a child (at least in Poland due to very high rent, third if not half your salary expect to spend on rent and utility bills) - not family friendly place. e.g. All events ""no spouse/partner"" allowed (except 1 family picnic) - DISorganized workplace environment (e.g. took a month to recieve a laptops and then none can say which access/accounts you need, can take even more) - 1 local IT person for a staff of ~1700 people office. Thus everything connected with tech be prepared to spend time for solutions yourself. If you are highly trained engineer seems like a waste of money to pay 3 times as much then required for onsite technitian for your time to figure out how things work - When hired from abroad do not expect any kind of relocation help except for Visa documentation (in contrast to other companies Amazon, Google etc. other companies can cover your rent and help with deposit for first month or even months) - If you are unlucky to get under a manager who won't or can't push for a proper raise for you. Nothing will change. And this is mostly the case. - Too much dependency and accent on a Personal responsibility and no consequences for someone not doing their job properly. Unless you ruin a high value contract or a customer complaint. Other than that you can take less work then anyone around and nothing ever going to be done mostly. (very same you can see in the feedback from a customers in TAC cases and so on. If customer is lucky to get responsible engineer they are happy, if not well... Cisco won't help you much about it. we had a person on a team who was spending 50% of the time or more on some inclusion trainings and presentations and not doing the job mostly, and that is considered a norm, yet workload was counted toward them too (per person average).

","- Develop the talent is not a clear target for the management. - Promotions are more based on time working at the company and/or relationships, but not on merit - Management is junior. Ex. 1. Performance is not measure of most of the roles, 2. In some teams the same roles have huge gab of experience, salary and seniority but they share the same tasks, roles and responsibilities - Most of the open positions for Poland are for low level roles. - Cisco hires normally on a low grade, and take 2 to 3 years to promote you. But internally you see by fact that locals are more promoted than foreigners. (Even if you have all the certifications, masters or MBA ). So, you will be condemned to be in the same position or grade for a long time even if you have the capabilities or potential of Chuck Robins . Why ? they don't have the process and tools to find smart and the internal best talent . They just need cheap work, not smart people.

This information will be mostly applicable for graduates/interns/people for whom this is the first job in IT. Here are some facts about Graduate program, which helps you to become a network engineer with almost 0 technical background. All facts are based on personal experience of finishing such program in EMEAR: + during ~6 month you get all possible trainings to be introduced to your job responsibilities + mentors assignment, so you are never alone with any issue/question you face + rotation in different teams/departments during the program + did I already mention that it does not require any networking background? + full-time, fully-paid (salary is above average for entry level positions) + access to all Cisco knowledge/learning platforms and all trainings + passing certifications for free (CCNA,CCNP,CCIE, etc) + international environment, cohort from all around the EMEAR + nice benefits: Multisport card(any gym you want and unlimited), Connected Card (money for transportation), Meal Card(for restaurants and supermarkets) + relocation bonus (if applicable)
Cons
- unequal load-balance between teams - some backbone teams are understaffed ( this problem is getting resolved, but slowly) - right now is kind of post-transition period, so you may face some of challenges connected with changes - great variety of tools and resources, which are really useful, but not cataloged , making it sometimes hard to find

2019-06-17, Business Development Manager,Kraków,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",Review of Cisco Systems (only applicable to Krakow site),"1) Flexibility is by far the biggest perk you'd get in Cisco Krakow. That, along with the great tools the company provides you, allow you to work remotely when needed. 2) Size of the site: it's a pretty big site (1600+ employees) with a quite low average age: people in Cisco Krakow are fun!
","1) Middle management in Cisco Krakow is really mediocre, and definitely not diverse. Most managers are Poles and while there's this appearance of inclusion and diversity within the company, at the end of the day you'll see locals (or Ukranians, the second biggest community) progressing in their career, getting promotions, recognitions, and so on... while it happens way too rarely for internationals (in proportion with the number of people, of course). 2) Being a low cost center in a saturated market like Krakow, the quality of talent Cisco manages to get there is not so high. 3) No meritocracy AT ALL. 4) No metrics/KPI / good place for early retirement: you will find lots of people in who just put in a few hours of work per day, get to work at 10:00, leave at 15:000, go for groceries in the meantime... and nobody cares, because there is no way whatsoever to measure anybody's performance (beside in a very few roles). Management doesn't even notice it. 5) Other departments within Cisco, in the regions, do not have a high respect for centralized low cost centers.

","Engineering-driven company with scattered UX practice and greatly varying levels of success. There are pockets of great design in various BUs, but unfortunately I was not in one of them. 8 bosses in 5 years, and the only excellent and fully competent one I had was fired because she rubbed some old-timers the wrong way.

","At Company level - Big variation in salaries for same grade - No transparent appraisal/promotion process - No proper feedback loop from engineers to skip-level managers - HR department is a joke - Pay less than market median - Frequent Layoff/Workforce reduction, Engineers pay for the miscalculation of VPs and Directors - G8 and G10 are eligible for RSU component in their pay, but rarely get it. At Personal level - Career growth *entirely* depends on the manager you report to. - All concern/feedback stop with your reporting manager. No clear path for escalation - How we get raise in salary or job grade is opaque and often just the opinion of our manager - HR redirects all queries back to manager - Politics and growth is controlled/supported by directors/mangers - People within the team often gang-up and create silos to keep their product and job safe.

Pros
high degree of flexibility (home/remote-office whenever you like, as long as you get the job done) competent salary (basic salary + bonus) a young, and dynamic team of competent internationals huge variety of further trainings possible (internal & external) receiving state-of-the-art technology (smartphone and notebook is a minimum) open workplace open-minded environment pragmatic approach during projects
Cons
due to the constant changes (senior management) also the direction of the business unit constantly changes, which gives a slight feeling of uncertainty even though it is one of the biggest IT companies worldwide, the company empowers their salespeople more than their hard-working engineers (often a feeling of not giving engineers the same respect as their sales-reps) constantly moving many high-competent positions to countries in which the salaries are lower (Poland, India) in order to save money

","Promotion can be slow. This is largely because churn is low, its common to see senior team members with 15 - 20 years service.

2019-04-18, Software Engineer,Bangalore,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",Good for seniors,"I have been with Cisco as a campus hire for almost 2 years now. Didn't feel like the company is fit for freshers, but good and manageable if you really want to purse in networking domain. This review is a bit biased since I have only seen Networking devices business of the company and not other businesses like Collaboration, Security, Cloud etc - Company culture is good. Not toxic or work obsessed. - Some good work in selected teams and projects (May be 5% of total teams). - Very employee friendly in terms for PTOs, WFHs, Maternity/Paternity leaves etc. - Good work life balance. - Less workload in most teams (depends on project or releases) - Code reviews usually make you a good progammer but it depends on the attitude of the reviewers. - Managers are mostly good and friendly. - Healthy food in cafeterias - Very good office environment and infrastructure. - You will have enough time to purse your hobbies or interests outside/inside work. - Good gyms and games facilities. Heard good things about other businesses under Cisco but don't have first hand knowledge of it. New projects, young technologies etc might be good.
","In general, not good for people who want to grow in their career. All the points are from the eyes of a fresher. - Work is mostly sustenance of legacy code and occasional feature addition. - Less learning opportunities. - Process oriented. Very difficult to get things done. Coding is only 10% of actual process to get the code or bug in. - Most of the good work is usually done in US and is moved to India for sustenance or continuation after success. - Pay is not competitive. They try to give the minimum possible to make employee stay. - US or abroad folks see India as cheap labor market and have this attitude is few occasions. - Many senior folks stay because they can't go elsewhere to get this good treatment at this stage of their career. - Many has become used to this slow environment and don't want to change anything other than getting more money. - Managers are bit obsessed about metrics like bug count, bug incoming, customer bug count etc but not about the product as a whole since it has grown so large for its own good. - Difficult for a fresher to get up to speed and start contributing since there are no proper documentations for old code. - Mentoring may not always be a feasible/effective idea since there is lot of history/legacy reasons associated with everything. - Hike cycle has been every bad in my experience. They postpone 6 months to 1 yr to give hikes and state lame reasons. When they do give, its not up to expectations or market rates. - They hardly give any stocks to non senior folks as rewards. - Promotions are given for good performers but management considers experience as the biggest factor for grade change. Hence, it is nearly impossible to get promoted in 1 or 2 yr even if you perform exceptionally. - Company is so big, you wont get any visibility more than 2 levels in most caseses. (i am 7 or 8 levels down) - Less breadth of work to really show your talents. You will get used to the slow moving environment and loose the enthusiasm especially when you are a fresher.

","- The salary in TAC is below par. Many times I have raised this issue to my direct managers & even to the higher bosses during skip-level meetings about considering to increase the overall pay across all grades but not a single cent has ever increased! Oh, and those eNPS survey as well. Not sure if the bosses who read the surveys ever showed some sympathy to the suffering TAC engineers - The kind of work you do in TAC is very narrow. You can be highly skilled in X technology but your knowledge in other technologies can be very poor (unless you have gained experience in these “other technologies” from your previous roles) - Favouritism! TAC has a funny system to get a payrise or a grade promotion because managers value you merely based upon what you have showed off to them or what they saw from the metrics/stats and not so much with the depth of the technical knowledge & experience you have gained over the years + the challenging issues you have resolved on your own + the number of times you have helped your colleagues with difficult cases. These are stuff the managers have failed to notice! Whoever read this may disagree but they disagreed because they never understood and they always thought they were right. This place can be awesome for newbies/grads because if they showed off their little contributions here and there, worked hard, stayed in the office after hours to either study or work on cases, and be nice to the managers, they will surely get the cool stuff, travel to other Cisco’s offices for BU rotations etc, and get promoted to the higher grade very quick even surpassing the salary of the seasoned TAC engineers - Politics everywhere! I have always wanted to stay in Cisco (outside TAC, of course) and I have applied for many other internal jobs before moving on. Of all those many internal positions I have applied, 95% of the time, I got NO interview invitations at all. Did my resume failed to impress the recruiter? Was there some kind of favouritism in other departments as well? Didn’t they like TAC engineers at all? Was there some kind of politics being played out? I don’t know the true answers but whatever the reasons are, it’s funny how I got an offer upon my very first external job application from one of the Big Four tech companies. Funny but this is the reality! - Constant & very high number of employee attritions due to the above reasons - High pressure work environment because you are basically a support engineer which means that you are there to resolve problems after problems, and for every customer, their problem is always urgent to be resolved.

Cons
Working remotely, specially when your manager is in a different city is a major downside. The people who work closely in the same office often get better projects which have more visibility.

Not everyone is given enough RSUs to make up for the difference. - Many senior women left my division after it became clear that the people running the division had zero interest in promoting women, even though the women in question were highly qualified, in most cases -more- so than the men who were promoted instead. - Additionally, multiple women were demoted after returning from maternity leave, meaning they lost their teams and responsibilities (a violation of FMLA). Men who returned from parental leave, even those who took the maximum amount of parental leave (several months), either resumed their former responsibilities and title or were promoted. - There's a corporate tendency to favor consensus over progress, and to manage to the stock price rather than to innovation. - The Director promotion process at Cisco is geared to only promote friends of upper management, which enforces patterns of bias. It's easier to leave the company and come back into a Director position than it is to be promoted from within. This drives qualified people out, which is a huge loss for Cisco.

Diverse workforce. Many opportunities to attend training and conferences. Worked there for 9 years and was promoted 3 times with 2 raises outside promotions.
","Engineering management varies widely between locations. My first 7 years were with a business unit where I had a great experience and was appreciated and promoted several times. Management was supportive and seemed truly invested in my career development and work/life balance. Development was team oriented with lots of collaboration and support from peers. Then I made an unfortunate lateral move to another business unit in another city with some major issues I did not anticipate. Engineering staff there had serious morale issues. My peers were constantly ""joking"" about how terrible the product we were all working on was. At first I wondered why nobody did anything to just fix the issues. After working there a while I realized it was because the engineers have practically zero ability to effect change in the product. So the senior engineers there are basically just going through the motions because the pay is pretty good, the benefits are basically second to none, and they don't want to lose that. Meanwhile the younger engineers are leaving because the environment is pretty awful. Having your own hard-wall office seems great at first until you realize you hardly ever collaborate with the people on your team. On my project the standard practice was to assign a single engineer to develop a feature, write tests, and perform QA in practical isolation. As you can imagine this was pretty stressful and didn't work very well, resulting in buggy products due to lack of a dedicated QA team. Asking for help on an engineering issue was usually like pulling teeth because you had to pull other engineers away from their work to collaborate. Management was not receptive of suggestions to change the status quo to alleviate these issues. My manager frequently missed our weekly one-on-one meetings, sometimes for several weeks in a row. When I attempted to reschedule these missed meetings my requests were frequently ignored. I know of at least 5 other engineers that left the org within a few months of when I did due to the increasingly toxic environment.

Pros
-Become an expert at a product/technology/platform -Management is supportive of your career ambitions (within the company or outside) -Work with and learn from some of the smartest people in the industry (I can't walk more than 30 steps without running into a CCIE) -Opportunities to learn other technologies from internal training and bootcamps -Flexible with taking off early for appointments (as long as not during your queue time)
Cons
-Limited number slots for promotions/raises, and promotions/raises happen once a year -TAC pay is not great (Cisco is a sales organization, and thus the money is in sales) -Long line of people for Technical Leader positions, can take years before you are considered (even if you have been operating at that level for years) -Can be difficult to convince upper management to allocate more reqs, teams can drown and become heavily demoralized before reqs are approved (and take even more time to hire the right person) -Older companies such as Cisco can be heavily political

","Corruption leaders, entire bands of leaders in Supply Chain lack vision. A LOT of infighting, politics, backstabbing making life horrendous for performers. Promotions are only based on who you know. Not an environment for professionals at all. There are gangsters that run GMO and they go hand-in-hand with counterparts in IT. Senior leaders in Supply Chain are routinely fired for corruption. one was recently arrested for 9.3 mil corruption. This culture is widely prevalent. AND SCO is supposedly the best run organization across Cisco (imagine that). A lot of job (role) duplication at work, diluting ownership. Whoever shouts louder wins (usually). They talk a lot about collaboration culture but it is passive aggressive and lot of command and control.

Futhermore, I love the culture. It supports people first rather than the job role. Cisco has a ""people deal"" that puts that culture into policy. I've always had management that has supported my individual growth and cared for me as a person more than what I produce. I appreciate that.
","It is a big machine, so as agile as Cisco tries to be, it just isn't possible in a company this size with more than 60k employees. Promotion is hard to come by without jumping to another role one grade level up. That said, there are tons of opportunities to move roles... even change careers within Cisco.

","Not equal opportunity employment. if you don't get your money coming in, you won't get it. it's impossible to get a raise or a promotion to the appropriate grade level that your peers are at. I've been here 5 years, no raise, no promotion, i'm one grade level under where my peers are which make it impossible for me to move within Cisco unless i want to go sideways or backwards.

This gives you good exposure to finance leadership and provides 4 different experiences. Good relationships with your LIFT class, some leadership opportunities within the program like leading meetings etc
","All the downsides are for LIFT, not necessarily Cisco -Short rotations of 6 months don't let you get a deep dive into some roles, the managers don't want to train you a lot if you're leaving in a couple months, so you take on trivial tasks. This makes you pretty much a glorified intern for each team you're on, not a true financial analyst. -The manager for LIFT controls your bonuses, rotations in the program etc. and you rarely ever get contact with her. There is a big communication disconnect. -Morale is low in the program. A lot of the people dread all the LIFT meetings and are not that excited for things. -A lot of the roles only provide you with about 15-20 hours of real work each week.

There’s ways to get involved to navigate the vastness, for example tuning into our company all hands meeting, also known as the Cisco Beat. This is an opportunity to hear firsthand our leadership’s top of mind and where Cisco is focused as a company. Another way to get involved is by joining an Employee Resource Organization (ERO), such as Early Career Network or Connected Women. These employee organizations are communities that help you grow personally and professionally by connecting you with others who share similar interests and come from similar backgrounds. It is a chance to experience the wonderful diversity that exists within Cisco . Lastly, the flexibility that Cisco has is unmatched. For example, just this past Thanksgiving Holiday I fell ill and not well enough to go into the office. Luckily, with our flexible working policies and my agreement with my manager, I was able to work the entire week from home – no missed meetings!
","Aforementioned, Cisco is a large company where success is emphasized by maintaining one’s own personal network and development. You have your roles and responsibilities but an added layer of continuous self-improvement through development courses and scoping careers on Cisco’s career site that might fit with your skillset.

Improvements to the buildings, indoor and out, are a refreshing change. * Volunteer opportunities are everywhere, with 40 hours of paid volunteer time off. * Paid certifications and training are awesome and allow you to advance your skills, but are hard to take advantage of when the teams are so small/overworked. * Senior management doesn't feel like they are too good to talk to you, even if it's just in the break room, but they are pretty hard to get a one-on-one with.
","* Advancement is slow and dependent on arbitrary metrics that workers have no visibility into * I've been in my position 2 years without a single formal review of my abilities. * The politics are absurd at times - you have to worry about hurting peoples' feelings, as Cisco is very ""feel-good"". * Upper management throws around tons of buzzwords but seems to be completely disconnected from the struggles of the troops on the ground. This may be true of all large companies, though. * Cisco is ""open"", but unless you've been there 10-15 years and have no fear of losing your job, most people will not raise the questions/concerns they have in open/public forums. * ""Escalations"" are absurd - everyone is quick to CC the next highest manager, and everyone gets in a tizzy over incidents, but nothing changes. It's cyclical. * There are lots of employee-lead organizations, but unless you're in a non-technical role (sales, marketing, HR, finance), you really don't have time to join them, especially when you are expected to work after-hours and weekends. * Cisco severely underpays its' workers, which is why turnover is so high.

2018-12-30, Principal Engineer,"San Jose, CA","Former Employee, more than 3 years",Great comp plan for high-end engineers;don't plan on a long term career here,"The benefits are outrageously good. The compensation is outrageously good. If you are a survivor you will do well here. If you are a high performer, you will do financially well here. If you slack, you may actually do better than the high performers as management keeps the slackers around to cut them every 6 months when LRs are mandated. When you are impacted by an LR and you will be, you earn a great exit package (I earned one year of base pay for 4 years of work...) The DCP is pretty cool for 13/89s, but on reflection, if I knew Cisco was such an unstable company, I'd not had invested in the DCP program as now all my DCP is paid in one big chunk in one year instead of spread over several years as I had planned. Live and learn :)
","Cisco's definition of culture in my brief 4-year stint was ""everything is about money"". That is good and bad - good because you can make some serious dough here, bad because there is no sense of community in the workforce. Cisco has limited restructurings in spring and fall. The lifers refer to avoiding a layoff as ""being safe"" which is in my mind an oxymoron. There is no such thing as safety at Cisco. If you come here, be prepared to move on when you hit the wrong set of cost lists. High performance is no guarantee of ""safety"" either; I earned 1.3x-1.5x multipliers on my bonuses every year for 4 years - still impacted by an LR. Most restructuring affects older (highly compensated) workers. There is no other logical conclusion to the restructurings than they are meant to cut already well-trained long-term growth employees and replace them with a younger untrained workforce. These LRs create intense stop energy in the company nearly all the time as everyone is in a state of panic. This ""Fog of War"" is difficult for innovators to execute in making Cisco pivot like an Exxon Valdez rather than an Eagle. Cisco completely doesn't understand open source and evidenced by the latest round of LRs in 2018 that impacted nearly every engineer doing any sort of open source work. The engineering workforce is far too compliant resulting in high degrees of passive-aggressive behavior rather than assertiveness.

","Layoffs every 6 months do not inspire confidence in employees who survive the culling. Sense of direction seems to be the equivalent of shooting a pellet gun in a dark room. Executive level leadership changes direction just about as often as they lay off blue badge employees. VP and above level management gets shuffled often, when you just start to establish a reputation with your superiors they either leave the company for greener pastures or are effected by 'limited restructuring' The ratio of contract workers to FTE (full time employees) is too high. Not enough opportunities for contract work force to obtain an FTE role w/benefits. I DO NOT RECOMMEND WORKING HERE IF: You're looking to make a 'nest' at Cisco and stay long term via starting out as a contractor, you'll never get converted to FTE. You're a contractor.

Too bad if you are a male employee right now..,"- Great products which make selling easier however competition is fierce so nothing is really that easy. - Top Family Health cover. - Car spot and Car allowance for sales executives - Can make decent money if already employed at a decent grade. - Great place to be right now if you are a female professional. - Sales all hands in Las Vegas - Sales tools and technology
","- Loosing its social atmosphere which was one of the companies great strengths. I feel this is due to a cultural change and the departure of some big personalities over the years. - Work load increasing due to regular company lay offs and role consolidation. Most staff just want to go home to rest rather than socialise amongst peers and management trying harder to reignite this artificially. - Sexism under the guise of ""Diversity"". Good luck if you are a male looking for a role or a promotion. It's getting harder and harder. - More inexperienced people in the business that you may need to carry.

This is a benefit for ensuring you get exposed to new technologies and projects. The culture in Ottawa is as similar to a start-up as you can get with a large company - there is great camaraderie amongst employees and inter-team collaboration. Compensation in Ottawa is very good compared to other large companies in the area. Vacation, benefits and perks are excellent.

Useless long-timers as managers, who keep firing people based on their likes and dislikes of people. Dis-proportionately large numbers of Contractors as compared to FTEs (at least in Services/CX) which shows the lack of any long-term vision. Marked discrimination between FTEs and Contractors in terms of treatment meted out (I was an FTE, so its not a disgruntled Contractor ranting). Absolutely no touch with HRs, they only interact with you on the day of your on-boarding and thereafter only when you raise a case which will be responded soon enough. Beyond that, no interaction, to the extent that there is no Exit Interview either when you resign. No onsite, at least none in IT. No hikes every alternate year.

2018-11-30, Systems Engineering Manager,"Atlanta, GA","Current Employee, more than 8 years",GREAT Place to work!,"Cisco is a great company! I have worked at many different companies including start-ups and other mature companies. I will be at Cisco until I retire. Cisco does an outstanding job at giving employees the freedom to deliver to their full potential and rewards excellence. Many companies claim to encourage upward mobility but never deliver. Cisco has an incredible amount of opportunity and every leader I have encountered at Cisco actively encourages her or his team member to prepare for the next role. Additionally, There are many avenues to share your ideas and execute on them if they make sense. Cisco celebrates diversity and has “ERO” groups to connect people of different backgrounds with each other. As an Air Force veteran, I am a member of the “Veteran ERO” and am always uplifted by the many initiatives and opportunities we have to celebrate our fellow Veterans and fallen Heroes. Lastly, I have never been at a company that has such an incredible culture of lifting each other up! We all need help and advice at times (in technology, probably more often than in other industries!). Most other companies have a few people you know will help you and not make you feel like a burden. At Cisco, it is RARE to find someone who is not overly eager to help, point you to someone who will help, or help you find the right resources. It is humbling to ask a question and immediately be in touch with someone who authored the book on a subject! As a large and successful corporation, benefits are very good and employees are given the necessary resources to succeed. We work on the newest technologies, with modern processes that help Cisco (and us as employees) to stay ahead of the curve!
","If you are not accustomed to change, you may have some challenge getting used to work at Cisco. Our leadership does a great job of staying relevant in the industry (our market share and market cap shows this). To do this, we are in a constant state of change. You basically have to hold on tight and enjoy the ride!

2018-11-29, Business Development Manager,"Research Triangle Park, NC","Current Employee, more than 5 years",Great place to work if you can own your career.,"I have had a great experience at Cisco for the past 6 years, moving from contracted employee (red badge) to full time (blue badge). Full Time means much less of the 9-5 hourly requirements that contractors have and a job based on deliverables and owning your time. By that I mean I have flexibility to set my schedule to make child drop off, personal time and other scheduling things without managers approval as long as I am staying on task. The ability to access the huge amount of Cisco and 3rd party training for free as an employee has been a major bonus. The yearly benefits like health/dental/vision, matching 401k and stock program are of high value. If you work at the larger offices (San Jose or RTP) the onsite amenities (cafe, gym, medical, etc) are top notch. Salary can vary widely, but I feel they are consistent with tech companies in the area. The annual bonus is split into 50% in the Spring and 50% in the Fall. Bonus is dependent on Company and personal performance. Employees are encourages to give each other recognition from $25-$500 in the form of a gift card for a job well done. I do value the way we treat customers and follow up to solve problems. We do the right thing and I would not be here if that was not the case. There are plenty of alternative careers within the company if you feel the need for change. Managers will support your path from my experience.
","You can get lost if you do not focus on your skills and creating visibility to your work. There is always an org change on the horizon, so you may change managers and job titles often. There are layoffs about once every 1-2 years. They can target the whole company or specific organizations. They will feel harsh and not based on performance and value, but the company is always changing and answers to shareholders. The constant change has led to very little feedback or official reviews for me. I have been fine, but this may be an issue for folks craving feedback.

Business Outlook
Pros
CEO Chuck Robbins has clear vision for future Intelligent acquisitions to accelerate into Cloud / XaaS space Focus on Customer / Customer Experience is sincere and gaining foothold (vs product / engineering led) Culture - you're part of something and teams support each other
Cons
Layoffs, called ""Limited Restructuring"" occur like clock work every 6 - 9 months, usually in September/October and February/March. These have happened consistently in the 6 years I've worked at Cisco. It's demoralizing, erodes the strong culture and instills a sense of inevitability for employees Limited advancement opportunities to Director, VP and above levels - and, annual layoffs at these levels, not tied to performance, but for ""organizational health"" (ie balancing the senior positions to early in career and junior employees).

2018-11-07, Senior Manager,,"Current Employee, more than 10 years",Cisco only for San Jose,"1. Great benefits 2. Remote work is available 3. New programs intended to help build your career
","1. San Jose based mentality is pervasive. If you are remote, you are almost always forgotten. Promotions outside of the valley are extremely rare. An employee that worked with me was told by her HR representative that she was ""easily replaceable"" with someone in San Jose. (Cisco HR is absolutely the worst!) 2. New programs to promote diversity and inclusion seem to pop-up every 3 months, but gender equality is all talk. More women are laid off than men every cycle, and promotions for women come at one quarter of the pace to men. (This is more likely due to the extremely low percentage of women in general) 3. Age discrimination is rampant. Seniority (or experience) matters for nothing - new employees (usually through start-up acquisitions) are consistently favored over long-time employees for new positions. 9/10 times younger employees are not 'restructured' given that they are comparatively inexpensive and generally easy to relocate (if need be). Given how complex and complicated it is to get anything done at Cisco, this slows down the flow of business every lay-off cycle, and creates a self-fulfilling need for restructuring.

Pros
Great work-life balance: as a delivery Engr. you get to work at home a lot particularly when doing designs documentation. You go onsite when it's time to do implementation. Trainings are plentiful, both onsite and web-based. The constant low to mid-management churn puts every one on edge which is a good thing.
Cons
Monthly Salaries can be better. You basically own your career at Cisco - your manager can seem distant from you most times.

2018-10-12, Product Manager,"Milpitas, CA","Current Employee, more than 3 years",Mixed experiences - much like most large enterprises in transition,"* Good work life balance * Competitive starting base salaries, but limited growth thereafter * Good benefits (dental on site, good gym etc. at San Jose office) * Working in headquarters is a good experience, but given the siloed nature of roles, you'll almost never meet a sales person in your office location * Great ecosystem of Cisco products for collaboration * Product Managers are given autonomy for the P&L of their product.
","* Quality of peers - Many people in power are just coasting in their career. Unfortunately, the commitment to a role at Cisco Product Management is proportional to how deeply engaged someone has been in the technical realm. There are too many people who have gotten into power just because of their relationship skills, and offer little or no value addition. On the other hand, people who have some technical acumen want to consolidate their position to ensure they're not laid off before their retirement. Creates a really weird culture of limited sharing and silos. * Very frustrating on how slow things move * Engineering used to be great, but is not any more and the company is not really equipped for its transition to software * Young people are discriminated against - that Cisco doesn't hire undergrads is also a problem since there are some really easy job functions that could be a good learning opportunity for early-in-career professionals * Negotiate all you want for the starting package, because you're not going to get appraisals for a while * Very limited diversity for most job functions * Best time to join Cisco was 2 years back so that you'd be at the peak right now. Unfortunately, assessment of company in the next 2-3 years is grim given recent innovations.

This is very important for me as I'm not living in my country, and I travel often back to see my family and friends. - Management style is very positive (always trying to help you and making you improve, not nagging you or punishing you). They also try to make you grow with trainings or extra projects - You can always express your opinion and you will be heard - I don't have flexible schedule as my other co-workers (This is due to working in customer support, that it's not usually the case for other roles).

What I love about Cisco is that at its heart it is truly customer focused company. If what you are doing is right for our customers you don't need to be a ""somebody"" to make it happen. As a woman there are two things that I really like about Cisco: #1 - If you get results, you will be rewarded. I have had good career progression by working hard on important things. #2 - Workplace flexibility, we have all the tools we need to work wherever and whenever we need to. This lets me work hard and balance being available to my family. The other thing which I love, love, love about Cisco is its commitment to giving back. This is part of the DNA of the company from the beginning. I call it ""entrepreneurial CSR"" because the company just encourages us to ""go for it"" and follow our passions in giving back to our communities. We get 5 days volunteering per year which the Cisco foundation matches with a cash donation for every hour we volunteer.

You can pretty much do your job anywhere in the world where you have a decent internet connection and are willing to be flexible with your working hours. I'm still at Cisco because the mentorship, support, development and career opportunities have been amazing for me. You have the opportunity to be exposed to different parts of the business, develop a passion for it and gain experience, then find a job with that group. My interests and experiences have lead to some really great roles at Cisco, not always doing the same thing, and for the most part - the managers are supportive. As a female, I have rarely if ever encountered a situation where I felt discriminated against. I've had support to work in different countries and been given time for personal development, support to achieve a post-graduate degree or just time off because I needed it.
","Not everyone gets to have the same great experience, and yes your organisation and your manager can impact this. However it's also up to you in terms of what kind of career you want to have here and be proactive about it. Extend yourself a little more - you need to give in order to receive. Admittedly, there can be some administrative things that could be improved in the company - we don't invest enough on improving some of our internal processes and tools.

Pros
Cisco is a great technology company and moves fast through acquisition. While that is good for business its not that great for employees, especially those who have worked there for a while. Every acquisition comes with a re-org. Plus there is constant churn at the VP/SVP level.
Cons
Un-due stress created for employees through constant re-org and resulting job cuts. Even in profitable businesses. Part of working for a company is a sense of trust that it has your back. In Cisco, its very clear to most employees that they cannot trust the company to take care of them. The next acquisition might take them out.

Pros
Cisco has made a huge investment in bringing a strengths-based approach to our culture and is backing it up in a myriad of ways - from processes that help leaders give the right kind of attention to their employees to investing in self-led learning for employees so every individual can continue to develop and grow in areas that are energizing for them. It is in the midst of a very exciting transformation with reinventing the Network, enabling a multi-cloud world, unlocking the power of data to inform AI, and deploying security everywhere. All this and amazing sustainability and giving back programs. The culture is amazing.
Cons

","-- The executive leadership say all the right things during internal all-hands meetings to make employees feel optimistic. But somehow, things don't seem to be executed to the bottom level. -- Directors reporting to directors and VPs reporting to VPs and some of these directors/VPs don't even have a team under them. Not sure why we need so many directors and VPs when we are not allowed to bring in skilled employees who can really contribute to the work. Excellent and and hardworking contractors eventually move out when another company is willing to bring them in as employees. And Cisco ends up losing productivity by having to search for and train another contractor. Happens over and over again -- When the company got a huge windfall from President Trump's corporate tax cut, employees were hoping we get to share some of that. Alas, the money was used for stock buy-back. Obviously, those holding large number of Cisco stock benefited the most. And guess who are the people who hold the largest amount of stock who enjoyed that windfall? Any special, one-time bonus or salary adjustment for employees to share some of that? Zilch.

","1-Extremely stressful env EVERYthing revolves around quota and sales even if you are not in sales teams. but if you are not getting your Quota while you are not sales function it will impact your performance and your bonus. 2-In my interview i was asked if i ever worked with quota and I said no but when i started my job I found out that they added quota on me and its noncommissionble and must bring it each quarter. i disagreed and then I said if I work on quota then I need my commission.. Managers did not agree and I had a conflict with them. 3- The company has VERY high turnover from employees and contractors. its not easy to deal with too many changes per day and week and month. 4- They keep acquiring companies and its tough to focus on your role since every other quarter there is a new re-org and new policies. 5-The work pace is TOOOO FAST and the company has TOOOO MANY customer accounts and they expect you to over perform and do your 150%. All the team members and your other colleagues are not easy to meet and talk with them. Every thing is Webex and ALl the workers are overloaded with work. 6- Its nice to have many Tools to help you do your work like webex etc BUT its overused with all the teams. for example if you ask any question about anything they team member will answer you with list of ALL the webex recordings and links by the time you want to watch them and understand the answer that is like a week worth of things and the team member thinks he did the write think for you but really he gave you Major new work. 7- Too many trainings, by the team you do your internal meeting (physical or webes), then you calls, then your huge list of links and webex recordings its really tough to achieve during your day since all these things take your time and you may have time later on the day to do some of your work. 8- There are SO many feedbacks on you during the week and after each sessions etc etc you need to be always connected with the team and it feels that you ONLY live for Cisco there is nothing else to do in this life. 9-I have never seen a company that asks their sales team commitment calls to be WEEKLY. So the sales team are in MAJOR stress and they stress the other teams with them. 10- Unless you like that type of env and CONTINUES work , then I don't recommend that company for people with Family and kids and social life. I noticed most people working very long hours from 8am until OPEN. 11- Cisco has many products (old, new, acquired, etc) and once you join, they will buy new company and then new products. Most of these products work in theory but in real life and at customer site its REALLY complicated and tough and they may work but with a lot of difficulties and many Cisco internal teams involvements. its Tough technical env. with all these complications. 12- Cisco were a hardware company and trying to switch to software company and that is difficult and too many challenges especially they don't have the software company mindset.

Any new perspective provided is immediately met with ""anti-Cisco"" sentiments. What is the point of hiring those with ""outside experience"" to only refute suggestions by stating ""This has always worked for us"" all the while conveniently ignoring your loss in market share and inability to innovate. Ok to be fair Cisco's idea of innovation is through acquisition. Good job, folks. The old timers need to be dropped and new fresh, clear minds that understand the newest generation of technologists in the industry. Old Cisco does not, or at least refuses to acknowledge, that these new generations approach technology, and problem resolution differently than their predeccessors. So new approaches are to be developed in both sales and product strategy within Cisco to address these needs. It is of no wonder why Cisco has been losing ground in market share and will continue to do so if their old timers are allowed to continue to operate at the regional level in positions of power.

2018-06-26, Software Engineer,Galway,Current Employee,An ok company,"- Work from home policy is very flexible - Possibility to take leaves on a very short notice - Option available to buy more leaves - Any equipment that is needed for work can be ordered without any scrutiny. - Convenient location if driving from eastern part of county. - Work/life balance is acceptable. There is almost never any pressure to stay beyond normal working hours. - Great involvement in local community projects and charity organizations. - People are genuinely very nice and fun to work with. - Sports and Social club does a good job organising events throughout the year; there is however a membership fee to participate. - On top of the above there is a separate fund to organize team outings every quarter which are always good fun. - A lot of attention is given to constantly monitor and improve coffee machines.
","- Strange location for an IT company, in the middle of an industrial park, outside of town. Not a very pleasant place to go for a walk with trucks and forklifts roaming around. Oranmore village is at least 20 min walk away, which is a bit far if one wants to go out for lunch. That's also where the bus stop is, so it's something to consider if using public transport to get to work. - Canteen is very bad. The catering staff are trying their best, but are very limited with what they can do because the kitchen is very badly fitted out, so they can’t prepare any half decent meals. - Cisco is ultimately a sales, not an engineering company so while good engineering practises are appreciated by some, it’s not what necessarily gets people promoted. - Salary, promotions and opportunities are good if one knows how to play the game and gets noticed by the right people. - A somewhat weird/cringy ‘we are an amazing company’ attitude from some people. It’s disheartening how much self-affirmation we received from winning the somewhat irrelevant ‘Great Place to Work’ survey last year while conveniently forgetting that we were competing against some small insignificant companies. We are unlikely to stand a chance if the top US software companies (i.e. companies we should really be compared with) decided to participate in a survey like that. There was a time when they decided to start giving us a free bowl of fruit every day, which is a great initiative if it wasn't sold to us as the greatest thing ever i.e. on the same level of getting a free house. - Because we don't really having any real proper competition in Galway, the company gets settled in the virtual security offered by ‘we are good enough for Galway’ mindset that hinders any effort or initiative to continuously improve and yet wonders why it is so difficult to attract experienced people in the field to work here.

When they are awarded, they are underwhelming and don’t match the local rent inflation • RSUs are very rare and, again, very political / based on team+BU • There is always talk about innovation by the leadership, but the culture is fairly stale as are the products, so opportunities for innovation are few and far between • No free food or snacks.

","Restructuring/layoffs are endemic, bringing constant attrition of people (good and bad) and low-level fear and malaise. Many great teams have been turned into poor ones, with capable, experienced, helpful and flexible old-hands replaced with incapable, inexperienced, unhelpful and inflexible teams in low-cost locations. This is not a criticism of the people, who can always be developed, but of the managers who try to automate their teams, removing any intelligence from the jobs and putting it into the tools and processes. The result is people who are simply told what to do and how, meaning no personal responsibility, minimal personal growth and low motivation, plus when the tools or processes break (which is frequently) there is little capability to keep the business flowing. Finally there are still too many teams with a lot of political grandstanding in the senior management--this is at best a nuisance and at worst can lead to poor decisions being taken by defocused management.

Pros
- Cisco brand - Great company to work for - Self-development - Face to face customer interaction
Cons
If for some reason your Manager (especially if he is of Polish nationality) doesn't like you, there is no way for you to advance, even if you are the best in the team. Even though that's against the HR policy, they don't really care. You have to be tough enough, otherwise you will be silenced by the Managers even if they are wrong and you are right.

Other people say Cisco has good work life balance. I think it depends on what product you are working on. I feel like I am under a lot of stress generally and put in a lot of hours. I have been at Cisco over 10 years and there haven't been a lot of breaks. Many of my coworkers work from home at least a couple days a week, especially after they moved us to an open floor plan. The people I work with are for the most part friendly, smart and professional. I love making killer products that make billions of dollars of revenue each year. I learn new things constantly and feel challenged.
","At least in engineering, there is not a supportive environment for women. There is lack of education among the first line managers how to promote respect and give air time to all type of people, and to promote, give opportunities, listen to and value the ideas of women. And there is some blatant sexism. For example, when I had my baby, my manager told me the 'right' thing to do was to become a stay at home mom. And despite making a sacrificial effort to perform well my first year with a baby, my manager said he gave me an average rating because I had a baby. His perception was colored by my being a mother. I thought I deserved a higher rating for an exceptional year. And he asked me what are my priorities, my child or my job? He didn't ask my male coworkers this question. Even now, he 'forgets' to give me a bonus even though he gave every other report of his one (who are all male). In the previous two layoffs, the only persons he laid off were women. He asks me to plan the fun group outings, not my male colleagues. On separate occasions, my director and my VP asked me to take minutes when there were plenty of men available to also take minutes. Many of my female coworkers moved on because of the frustration of not having their opinions valued as much as our male coworkers. It's a tough problem to solve because people come to Cisco from many types of backgrounds, but I feel there is no management support from any level of the management chain except for Chuck and his direct reports. Open space floorplan is distracting visually and audially. The space is so tight that the moveable whiteboards are not near our desks. Currently, morale is a little down because it is not clear how individuals will be engaged in making the future roadmap happen. People fear for their jobs. We've had repeated layoffs in my group, and there will be more to come.

Salaries are fair, plus there are additional financial rewards such as an annual bonus and the opportunity to be recognized with gift certificates from co-workers. The facilities (campus, office, relax areas etc.) are world class. There is a lot of diversity, many different nationalities in the office which creates a good vibe. You will have opportunities to take part in many fun and/or charitable activities, and the company encourages it by giving additional time off to participate (for example preparing Christmas gifts for needy children, animal shelter visits etc.) Many opportunities for development like training, mentorship or shadowing. However this requires initiative from you, don’t expect anyone else to handle your career development for you. Often the company can sponsor industry certifications like PMP or ITIL. Flexible work options. In most roles you can work remotely, and in some you will have a lot of control over your work schedule.
","Not specifically a con, but your experience at Cisco will depend a lot on your manager and team, which probably applies to any company out there. If possible, use your network to find out more about the specific team you are planning to join because not all teams are the same in terms of atmosphere, work schedules etc. You can’t really expect quick and regular salary advances and promotions. In my experience, you will need to consistently perform above your level, plus the timing and budget must be favorable. In other words, hard work plus a bit of luck are needed. Some employees are obviously performing above their level and waiting for the right recognition. Because of that I've seen valueble employees decide to leave.

Cisco provides to its employees a huge amount of resources to work and study. Moreover, mobile workers that are mostly in Sales and Services are able to perform daily job in a very flexible manner. Cisco gives an amazing opportunities for people who had just finished of finishing their studies. Incubator and New Graduate programs give a lot of benefits for future specialists
Cons
It is hard to rate Cisco globally, better to focus on one center, which is Krakow. Cisco Krakow is barely managing in offering competitive salaries to professional hires and seniors. For a new graduate or inter this could be fine, but there is very small salary and carrier growth when a person is improving his skill-set and doing all the best to company. It is not the best strategy for this site to hire mostly people after university (with no or limited experience). Would be good if Cisco gives more credit to already hired employees at least for their fidelity and hard work.

Overtime was available if you wanted it. Perks were varied and excellent. They had a reward scheme called connected recognition which was good - if abused. 3) Travel was common: in my line of work, it was common to travel across Europe and the world. Cisco have a very well organised and structured travel system and they will make sure you're well taken care of when abroad. 4) The corporate culture is healthy and caring. They're not too big on waving their own flag or banging their own drum yet at the same time they quietly promote Cisco and help out in things like STEM programs at schools and universities and startups. 5) Progression: Training was available if you wanted it and it was easy to move within Cisco to different roles if you could demonstrate your ability.
","1) Usual corporate politics but thats the same everywhere to be honest. 2) Conspicuous lack of season ticket loan which was a bit weird - though I think they've rectified this since I've left. 3) Sometimes it takes time for new acquisitions to really bed in within Cisco which can lead to friction between existing Cisco employees and the new guys. 4) Communication between business units quite rare.

Pros
Cisco's People Deal is real and is pervasive in all of the moments that matter in your career. From your recruitment through retirement/moving on, Cisco aims to make sure they make each ""Moment that Matters"" special. The HR Leadership Program (HRLP) has given me multiple rotations through various HR specialties, giving me a good base knowledge of HR and has helped me identify where my strengths and passion will allow me to contribute at a high level. In HR you are treated like a true professional. As long as you're performing at an acceptable level, no one pays attention to or cares where, when, and how you get your work done. This is great for work flexibility. I have worked from several locations for extended periods of time only needing to take part of that time as Paid Time Off, and not missed a beat. The technology plays a large role in the work flexibility as in any given day I can be talking with people from any part of the world, face-to-face over WebEx or Telepresence video.
Cons
As the technology can allow for great work flexibility, it can also allow work - if you don't proactively manage it - to take over your life as you CAN always be available. Manage your schedule with your stakeholders and you'll be fine.

If you work in a Sales or Marketing role, as I did, the doors will be wide open to you. Cisco has partnerships with major players in almost every industry. You will have the opportunity to network widely within your field.
","The divide between red and blue badges is wider here than at many other companies. If you get stuck in a contract role, you'll face a real uphill fight to get converted. Decisions from leadership can sometimes seem draconian. I've seen entire teams dismissed at the drop of a hat. Presumably these events come as the result of a compelling business reason, but that's not ever communicated clearly throughout the ranks, contributing to an overall sense of vulnerability among staff. There are many BUs within the company that are siloed off from one another, making it difficult to streamline and share institutional knowledge. This can lead to inefficiencies and duplicated efforts. I can't honestly say that the executives' vision for the company is clearly communicated. It can be challenging to find after several months (or years) of working toward a target, that the target was moved by someone in the board room and your team wasn't informed. It can be like pulling teeth to secure budget for certain projects, while leadership will rain dollars on other departments that they happen to favor.

Cisco's hierarchical structure feels very flat and is incredibly symbiotic. Company culture isn't harsh, but encouraging and friendly. It's all about development--focusing on the team and specifically the positive and building relationship you should have with your manager. Those who are ambitious, work hard, and genuinely network will be recognized for their efforts and will be rewarded with great work opportunities. Cisco espouses the principle that in joining this one company, you can have multiple careers. Cisco can scale talent due to their collaborative technology--enabling us to hire top talent across the globe making Cisco a very diverse and culturally enriching environment.
","Business functions can be siloed from one another. Not always an apparent information share between functions. Building bridges and tearing down walls can be arduous and time consuming. There is a lot of red tape, and it's not uncommon to deal with work that, in principle, should move very quickly but is slowed down because teams can be scattered across the global with different timezones. Cisco's culture of ""let's create a formal meeting"" in order to get work done isn't efficient, and it's hard to be a change agent in a team that has a culture of working to solve problems by creating formal meeting after formal meeting.

","Cisco HR wants to ""help"" managers by hard coding tools so that managers are ""in empowered"" to reward employees as they sit fit. For example, once a manager wants to promote an employee there is a guideline on how much pay would accompany that promotion. However Cisco HR takes it too far; the pay HAS to be a certain amount, can't exceed a certain and must come out of a budget deemed promo budget. A leader who is managing within their budget is completely crippled by the rules HR sets around how to manage the team & rewards. Its ridiculous and completely contradictory to ""The People Deal"".

Lots of the help on the web is archaic and simply results in 404's. IT support is generally pretty bad too.

2018-03-28,Anonymous,,"Current Employee, more than 10 years",Cisco Services is a sweatshop.,"1) Opportunities to learn technologies in depth. 2) Get customer handling skills.
","1) Cisco Services executive leadership is working hard to transform the services business to a call-centre business. On an average Cisco Services in US pays significantly less than other Cisco orgs at any grade level. It is common for employees to jump orgs and give themselves an automatic raise. Services is losing talent for several years because of these disparities & scores of extremely good engineers and first line managers have moved out for money. 2) Promo cycles are a myth. It is not uncommon for people to work their @ss off for several years in a row just to be told that either the much awaited promo/equity cycle did not happen, or it was too little to mean anything. By the way, this happens right after massive promos in senior management layer. 3) Management keeps cramming more work into the job role every few months - for no extra dime. Engineers besides learning and supporting their technologies & customers are asked to cross train with other technologies, learn scripting, automate processes, create content, help improve product quality. If engineers don’t invest their personal time there is no way they can meet these unrealistic expectations. 4) Outsourcing has brought morale to a new low. Tremendous amount of services work got moved south of the border in last three years. There is no concrete communication from upper management whether or not they want services' employees in US to thrive or to look out.

Pros
I worked for Cisco for 20 years, 11 months and enjoyed most everyday. I had a lot of opportunity to grow my talents and participate in making the internet what it is today. Worked many hours and traveled a lot but it was well worth it. Met a lot of great people all over the world.
Cons
After 20+ years I was all of sudden laid off along with 800 other employees. I was not given any opportunity to find another position or any reason why I was being let go. I was planning to retire in 4 years and now due to my age I am having a hard time finding a new job. Since the new CEO took over the company has gone downhill as far as loyalty to employees is concerned. Most people I know are always worried about being laid off. I would not recommend Cisco to anyone now as long as this culture persist.

","If you are in virtual sales (GVS), STAY FAR AWAY. It has gone from being the most rewarding and enjoyable job to an unhealthy call center environment. The VP decided to fix something that was not broken and make everyone work out of the RTP office instead of hiring real raw talent. The director rules by fear and walks the floor to make sure people don't leave before exactly 5pm on a Friday afternoon (this job is requires long hours and they don't allow you to put in overtime, mind you), and you have little or no support from operations. Half of my peers were either in therapy or needed it, and they were always so terrified to come in every day. Also, there are layoffs every single quarter. The ageism is real in this company. You are not safe unless you're an older white male. The culture isn't the best here for women either. No one ever feels safe to report when men are inappropriate.

Strong technologies, acquisition strategies and in general work/life balance is good. Great ability to advance and move laterally within the company. Good benefits overall.
","Too much middle management, micromanagement and a total lack of trust in employees - no empowerment. Benefits vary widely depending on where are you located (San Jose and RTP are totally different worlds than most other offices). Sales management is stuck in ""route/switch"" hardware sales mentality and is unwilling to adapt to new ways of selling. Commission structures for sales are incredibly broken and aren't adapting to new software/enterprise agreement models leading to very unhappy sales teams and lots of attrition. Enormous year over year quota upticks are almost impossible to understand. With the exception of Meraki, Cisco absolutely devastates the cultures of companies they acquire - taking away all the perks, quirks and inspirations that make those acquired companies so successful. This also leads to resentment when small pockets get to retain those perks that other acquired companies lost (again, referencing Meraki). Frequent ""Limited Restructurings"" are used in punitive ways to get rid of folks that management doesn't like or that offer up strong opinions. They also seem to affect a suspiciously high number of over 40/very senior workers. ""Managing Upward"" has become an artform within Cisco, leaving higher management levels with a very clouded view of the real problems that exist.

There are multiple customer service offerings at Cisco who's day to day job comes down to nagging TAC about support cases regardless of case progress/status.

It's a myth that coding is intrinsic property of a person. I feel coding is not individual but a cohesive task and with right people you have higher chances of writing better code. Cisco is one of that place where writing bad code is really tough job because it's not you can do easily here. 2. Growth opportunity here is tremendous. From outside it is one company but from inside it is around 10 different business units and believe me they all are not easy to get inside. It is really great how you can switch between these all BU's and be in the same company. It's great for the profile build up. 3. Hell amount of innovation and technology languages. You name it, Cisco has it. 4. World class office space and world class discussions.
","1. Work from home gives you great work life balance but at the same time you end up working 24X7 2. Huge org, so it is difficult to make yourself visible. Some people generates tendency to be in shadows. 3. Little bit slow in day to day work style.

It took one call to HR and zero paperwork to add my partner to benefits. When I reached our HR to say I had come out and wanted to know if there was an employee group, their first words were “congratulations.” Our resell partners sponsor an LGBT social at our annual sales conference (we have the best resell partners on the planet). And we have executive sponsors who honestly care about our welfare. They matched my donations to Orlando, PRIDE, and supported us in the San Francisco parade. They are sensitive to the situations other employees face in other countries.

2018-02-15," Senior Manager, Business Development",,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",Out and Proud LGBTQ at Cisco Systems,"In 2014, I was part of a small Cybersecurity company of 20 persons, the only woman and out LGBT person on the team. Cisco acquired our company; and with any acquisition by a large multinational corporation, there is some wonder about how the culture will change. I was very happy the last 3 ½ years to see the culture became even better. The Executive Leadership Team (ELT) is serious about executing on our core strategy and “The People Deal”. People ask me how I like working at Cisco…I love it! We work like a small start-up in my business unit, with the encouragement to Be Bold and take risks in Innovation; however, there is the power and strength of over 70,000 people working with you for the same goals. It is awesome to travel all over the globe and have your Cisco badge work in hundreds of locations. As an out LGBTQ person, I have found Cisco to be such a welcome and inviting place to work. Some highlights include, welcoming my same-sex spouse as part of the greater family; great health care benefits; Time2Give, where I volunteer 40 hours a year at LGTBQ non-profit organizations; Community Giving, where Cisco matches my donations to LGTBQ non-profit organizations and pays them $10 an hour for my volunteer service (for time above Time2Give time off); a strong LGBTQ & Allies employee resource organization with a private Facebook group & quarterly global meetings; Lesbian Lunch & Allies monthly meeting in San Jose; paying for my attendance at LesbiansWhoTech Summit in 2015; the ELT taking a public stand against discrimination on social media & in the press; Cisco signing the UN policy about diversity in the Workplace; and on and on. At a LGBTQ & Allies global PRIDE WebEx, a sales person in the UK asked an executive about being in the closet with his customers, worried he might not be able to make his quota if a customer knew he was gay and would not want to do business with him. The executive answered, “We obviously must have hired you because you are the best at what you do in your region. You represent Cisco. If they don’t want to do business with you, then we don’t want to do business with them.” I am grateful and proud to be part of the Cisco Family. #WeAreCisco #LoveWhereYouWork

2018-02-15, Engineer,"Chandler's Ford, England, England","Former Employee, more than 10 years",Not what it used to be,"Salaries are competitive. There are many perks such as healthcare; flexi-time; working at home; shares; the ability to gift other employees awards in the form of vouchers; pension contributions and up to 30 days holiday if salary is used to buy 5 days on top of the base 25 days. Good infrastructure, facilities, nicely laid out buildings, a small canteen and generally good people, with a few exceptions (see '",").
Cons
The problems lie with Cisco not knowing how to run the STB side of the business; local upper management and middle management being uncommunicative, and a contracting business, with hundreds of layoffs around the globe in ex-NDS offices, many coming at the end of 2017, in preparation for what may likely be, a sell-off (Bloomberg wrote an article late last year. 'Google Bloomberg NDS'), now that it's cheaper to run. Cisco have halved the workforce in 5 years, with only one client, Sky, now paying for the s/w created. There are 4 'culls' every year, roughly every 3 months which are usually small but have increased to 20+ people in the last year. This has lead to a more negative atmosphere in the last couple of years. If you're unlucky and end up in the wrong team, you could be working with mangers and colleagues who look after number one and hide their ineptitude and bad behaviour from those above, whilst making themselves look good off the back of other people. Complaining to HR doesn't do any good, they're still there. It doesn't help there's no local HR department, as they were 'no longer needed' over a year ago.

Promotion is too hard to get.. you need to perform like best in team for 3-4 years continuously to get it.. - There are very less teams where you gain a good domain knowledge while working.. else everywhere just sustenance work. - Most of managers do not care of your learning/development, their main concern is just to get the bugs fixed on time. So most of them follow the push mechanism to get the work done. - You wont find any motivation to work. No one talks about new technologies and year by year you will loose confidence in yourself.. as you will work hard even then you wont get any appraisal.. - Most important thing, engineers are treated as slaves. Till the time they need you, you will be treated well and when they don't need you they will find a better slave and dump you..

It gives them a lot of opportunities to explore different things and develop skills. The expectations on a new grad is mainly their weekly bug fix targets, which would not be too difficult to meet, so there is a lot of time for hobby projects. I assume at this age, the expectations from employee side would also be limited (in terms of compensation, benefits etc.), and Cisco would surely meet those.
","The problems at Cisco start when you spend say 5+ years and move to higher grades. - The pay hikes come once in 2 years and when they come, the budget gets used up for giving some director/VP promotions, leaving pretty much nothing for engineers. Some of the directors get even some random promotions at odd times! - In spite of all this, when an exec leaves, we feel there is absolutely no difference that it makes to the system that makes us wonder what they were doing to justify their heavy paychecks. - Execs are allowed to stick around in the system and make a ""graceful exit"" even if they are stripped of their responsibilities as part of some re-org. However, for the lessor souls, you may be asked to sign your resignation one fine morning when the lay-off season comes. - As an engineer, your growth is not related to the engineering contributions you make, on which the top management has limited interest or visibility. Your growth mainly depends upon how much ""contacts"" you have with the top management, and how you advertise yourself by showing off as ""being on top of everything"" 24x7. There are chances that some of the pressure tactics would take you to depression / mental breakdown.

","- A lot of visionary top leaders have left the organization in last few years. The current top management is unable to connect with engineers. They lack vision, charisma and motivational skills and just know how to use whip and do some program management. Have absolutely no interest in building team dynamics or developing the career of engineers, and seem to be mainly focused on their own job security and progress. - For an individual contributor, career becomes stagnant after around 10 years, unless you are in the ""good books"" of someone in the top. But this may not be specific to this organization but a common Indian thing. There are a lot of stringent criteria that will be used deny a promotion for an IC. However, in the management ladder, you could see mediocre folks getting promoted quickly and growing in the path just because they have some X number of people under them and are able to squeeze more work on less number of people, etc. - Work life balance is not great, with several managers indirectly promoting working close to 24x7. I am sure this sort of work culture would have considered as a strong violation of labor laws if it were in some European country. Again, this is not a Cisco specific thing, but a normal scenario in Indian IT industry.

Expertise available in all areas which is fantastics for career growth. 3. A very competitive work place where fairly low percentage of people can take their position for granted. 4.

","A lot of KPIs that the management is pushing for in a bid to prove the value of the Customer Success team. Cisco is a sales organization, so there is large pressure for creation of expand opportunities. Even though there is so much push to get those KPIs fulfilled, people on the ground are limited due to the strange way in which the expand opportunities are measured. This is especially difficult in APJ region due to resistance from internal stakeholders. Everyone in the team came in very excited and motivated about Customer Success, but I am seeing some level of disillusionment and exhaustion to keep up with ever-changing performance measures, tools, new offers with little to no time to adjust, and high pressure from the managers.

","The salary is 20% lower than the market - you can get more just across the fence at AON, ABB, Motorola and many others. Do not expect to grow as an engineer there - mostly you will deal with platform specific bugs and defects in a very, very narrow field. Do not expect to build a carrier - to get a higher grade is extremely hard. And it's all about showing your hard work and not about actually working hard (Visibility - as it called in all big companies). Do not expect a salary raise. Bargain straight from the beginning. The raise is independent from your work and expertise, but rather from the stars in the sky. Expect to be surrounded by fresh graduates, who will bombard you with stupid questions and will lower your value as an engineer because they will do the same job as you do for less money and you will educate them for free. Working in TAC you will be the first to be hit - angry customers with problems will shout at you, sales will shout at you, because customers shout at them, your manager won't shout but will be on their side. Don't relocate to Krakow - smog is a huge problem there (especially if you have children) and rent market is crazy and full of scam.

That said, Chuck Robbins' Executive Leadership Team has been making a concerted effort to address problem areas.

There is a lot of people, it's really hard to get a promotion, even when you do, it really doesn't change a thing, you keep doing the same everyday. It's different to be in Cisco Mexico, small offices, with little culture of integration, I assume is different if you are in RTP or San Jose. Work shifts varies and it is really hard to balance your personal life with your work. Managers won't trust you easily to get you new projects and experiences. You kind of get stuck in the same place forever.

Many interesting, talented and dedicated people from whom you can learn a lot. Trainings - the abundance of online learning materials that every employee can leverage in order to gain more knowledge and master certain skills whether it be required or desired. Innovative tools - one of the best things is that we get to use what we sell (especially collaboration tools) that makes our jobs more productive and engaging. Activities within and outside the office - many volunteering and sports activities that are not only fun, but also very helpful in terms of getting to know your team mates and other people working at Cisco. If you are a person who likes personal and professional development, open for constructive feedback from anyone inside the organisation, enojys challenges and leverages opportunities, it is the right place for you.
","- It is an enormous corporation, therefore hierarchy and bureaucracy are unavoidable as in all of the big organizations. - The hiring process is selective and competitive which is why it takes an effort to make it through. - If you are not open to constant challenges and changes, it is not the place for stability.

2017-11-28, Associate Sales Representative,,"Current Employee, less than 1 year",CSAP Program/ Associate Sales Representative in Cisco,"This a great sales training program to start the career journey. Cisco is a tech giant and well known as an amazing company to work where you get to work alongside fantastic people - innovative, intelligent and passionate individuals. Innovation is in the core of Cisco’s values which pushes you to challenge yourself and grow more after every single challenge. The structure of the CSAP program prepares you with a wide perspective about technical sales to ensure you would be successful after the program as well. As an Associate Sales Representative during the program, we were trained by fantastic people who strived constantly to ensure our success both professionally and personally. The role is exciting and challenging in how it exposes you to always think beyond of not just selling products but selling business outcomes. Personally this is the most important thing for me - I value the relationships I have with the customers, and with this mindset I always try to find the best possible option for them to reach their own goals. In Cisco there is no leaving things to chance - if you are in the program that is because they believe the value you represent and the value you could add to Cisco. This program will give you the endless opportunities to grow and be the most successful version of yourself.
","Not necessarily a con however if you are a person looking for a stable work environment with a small room for change, Cisco is the very opposite of it. To be able to keep up with technology, like every other company, Cisco also needs to be adaptable and ready for ever-changing processes. If you like challenge and put in effort to be on top of the news, it wouldn’t be a problem.

Benefits are great - ESPP, bonuses, PTO (We had the same number of vacation days as we had before Cisco bought us, so I can't actually tell). Opportunities to change career paths - both to relocate, and to change business unit - Cisco allows it. Community involvement - employees get 5 days a year to volunteer at a NGO of their choice, plus matching program. And there's more. A lot of professional courses, both technical, management, human-interaction skills, and management - Cisco invites excellent tutors to educate her employees on many many subject, you just need to ask your manager for approval. I took technical courses mainly, such as MongoDB, Postgres, Extreme Java development, ElasticSearch, etc. And for all of them I can say - I've learned a lot and enjoyed it. Work-Life balance is good. Even in times of crisis, we were not as stressed as we were before Cisco bought us. One reason is the demand made by Cisco to it's departments to define reasonable, deliverable goals. Even getting fired by Cisco is pleasesnt - I was fired as part of a mass layoff - the compensation package is very generous and they even provide proffesional help on getting a new job. To me that says a lot. Plus, Every one I've met in Cisco was super nice and professional. Also, Once my manager approved - Cisco had no problem allowing me to work part time, on fair conditions. That meant a lot to me.
","Big company means big bureaucracy. Some of their processes are very cumbersome and frustrating. Like getting a refund for something you bought for work. So many layers of management and departments - you don't really get to know most of what the company is doing. even though they try to get employees connected and involved - it's a challange.

2017-11-09,Anonymous,,Current Employee,Great place to work for grads,"Joining as a graduate and having been part of other graduate roles with other companies that I won't name, Cisco really devotes a lot of time to training and developing their employees. The interview process did not accurately reflect the culture that lies within Cisco, one that truely cares and provides meaningful work. As someone who struggled with the quarter life crisis, wondering if a terrible 9-5 job for the rest of my life in 'mundane corporate' doing pretty much nothing but pretending to look busy whilst shuffling numbers on spreadsheets or doing meaningless presentations no one cares about, Cisco definitely changed my perspective on corporate life. The work is meaningful, it gives me purpose, and whilst it is challenging, you are adequately rewarded and then some. The people are excellent and if you are passionate about technology, this is the place to be. A moral and ethical company, I strongly feel that Cisco is a great place to work. I highly recommend to anyone who were overachievers in high school and university who feel like their talent is wasted at other companies to apply to Cisco as they will push you to your best.
","There is some cons to mention however. Again and again, I keep seeing people who are toxic to the organisation promoted. Positive encouragement and a flexible culture should be fostered and those that promote this culture of pushing boundaries, thinking outside the box, creativity, and making decisions with a bit of gut should be moved forward. Those who hold a traditional view of the office, making every i is dotted and every t is crossed, with their archaic ways and no value add to the company should be kept in positions where they have no influence over the culture or better, removed.

Pros
Amazing workplace with a lot going on in Networking more than what you could imagine. The company always embrace innovation and pulls in new technology that comes in order to maximize their profits and provide a better service to their customer. Highly customer oriented. Provides flexibility in working hours to employees and provide awesome perks.
Cons
It takes time to get your hands on good quality of work. As the Networking is quite vast, be ready to learn something new almost everyday but if your work is ad-hoc and repetitive, there is no skill you would end up developing, So it really depends on which team you are in.

Non-hierarchical culture, good ideas from anywhere can get attention and support. Best flexible work practices in the industry, hands down. Cisco really walks the talk and shows how a virtual corporate culture can flourish and pay off. New benefit offerings also speak volumes about how they care for the whole employee - longer paid bonding leaves for parents and grandparents, flexible emergency time off policy that each manager can tailor to meet their employee's needs, Time2Give which provides a full extra week of paid time off per calendar year to volunteer for a non-profit or educational institution of the employee's choice (above and beyond any team volunteering and give back events).
","Cisco did not act quickly enough to shift its business model when AWS and other cloud vendors became threats. Now we are playing catch-up. Don't get me wrong, we have ALL the resources needed to win the catch-up game: cash on hand, transformation strategy, excellent CFO explaining it to the street, excellent people... But we have some things that could drag us down: sheer size (lack of agility), continued success in high-margin core business (hard to decide to cannibalize yourself), high-level leaders who have been around too long, have too internal a view, little outside experience and who have succeeded too long in the old way to be willing to jump quickly to innovative strategies or new business models.

Pros
I worked for almost 6 years before moving to different company. The policies are employee friendly, good campus ( Bangalore-Cessna park), good cafeteria, company provided transportation is the best, up to $100 per month internet bill reimbursement, easy to change teams internally. HR team and policies are women friendly.
Cons
# Too many Org. changes, frequent layoffs, stupid 1st line managers who have no clue how to manage senior resources. # Hikes are unpredictable - sometimes two consecutive cycles are missed, sometimes the numbers are really low. # Getting promotion is next to impossible if you are a G8/above. You need to be a really good boot-licker to get consistent hikes/promotion. Annual performance review is a joke- manager rates you as he wishes (rarely based upon your performance) # New College grads are being hired at salary higher than people working in cisco with 6-8 years of workexp. # Some 1st/2nd line managers behave as if they are the CEO of the company- arrogant and unprofessional attitude. # Lack of strategic vision for future by the top management. # NOT a company to stay for more than a few years- you constantly have the layoff sword hanging over your head!!!

We do business in over 120 countries worldwide. If you are a go-getter and have a passion for learning from work experience and global coworkers, Cisco is a perfect place to gain knowledge and grow your network which will help you through the duration of your career. Also, many roles are partial or full telecommute-roles, aka, work from home roles. Helps a lot for families with small children or folks who just live too far from a Cisco campus. There is a good range of younger, fresh out of college employees to seasoned veterans who have been in the industry for 10-30 years - so it's easy to find people that you want to hang out with or learn from. Their social media teams are very engaged and a lot of the groups make working at Cisco fun! The different work teams and affinity network groups host fun events such as sports tournaments, concerts, outdoor lunches, networking events, and many more. We are partnered with Ticketmaster/Live Nation, as well as sports leagues like the MLB and NBA, so you may run into free tickets occasionally. Great benefits (health, dental, vision, stock purchase program, 401k, life insurance), although salary is a bit low.
","Free food is not a company standard, although many groups offer some free meals and snacks in the office. The pay is lower than the likes of Google, LinkedIn, Facebook. The company is so big and complex that sometimes, shy, young new hires are underutilized and underdeveloped. Too many meetings. Relatively low base salary, but benefits make up for it.

2017-10-10, IT Business Analyst,"Research Triangle Park, NC","Current Employee, more than 3 years",Early in Career IT Analyst,"I started working at Cisco immediately after graduating college. I was placed in operations and was able to learn some valuable generic business skills. Although the role wasn't necessarily a good long term fit for me, I was able to find a new job within Cisco IT after about 2 weeks of looking for something new. This new role has been amazing! I have a manager who is flexible with my work hours, coworkers who are fun and hard-working, and work that makes me feel fulfilled. Every time I talk to my family about my job and work/life balance, they are amazed and advise I stay at Cisco for as long as I can. I believe I am paid well for my status of early in career and I am learning a lot of skills that will be beneficial in whichever line of work I do. Management is great and I feel that out of the three managers I've had, each one of them were attentive to my personal and career growth. I have not had any experience at other corporate workplaces, but I know that I have fallen in love with the culture of Cisco. I feel as if this is a safe place with no judgments, people who care about you, and provides an open work environment. Definitely a great place to work and I highly recommend!
","Cisco is a large company and therefore, it can sometimes take a while to get things done due to red tape. I personally have not encountered this problem yet but have heard stories. Even though I am lucky to be on a team with an average age of about 26, many people who work at Cisco are a little older (or wiser). As an early and career worker, it can sometimes be difficult to relate to those who are 20+ years older than I am but that doesn't mean they are any less nice.

Overall legacy benefits are still good enough in this industry (at around, or a bit above average). If you can lock high position/salary, you shall take it.
","After Chunk took over 2 and half year ago, he only give regular employees 2 times of promotion/salary increasing. First interval is 12 months, 2nd interval is 18 months. In John Chambers' time, this interval is 6 months. Normally, at Cisco, each time only 8 - 15% employee got promoted. Even the interval is 6 months, it takes > 3 years for a regular staff to get chance promoted in average. Now Chunk make it 18 months or more, the simple calculation will tell you that each promotion takes more than 10 years in average ! So unless you are at your later stage of career and secure a top position, it's not wise to join Cisco. It's not friendly to its employees anymore. For average people, if he/she joins Cisco now, his/her career development is stalled.

2017-09-18, Virtual Customer Success Manager,"San Jose, CA","Current Employee, more than 1 year",Virtual Customer Success Manager-CSAP Rotation,"This is a great sales training rotational program for people with sales experience who want to first learn about and understand the Customer Success role. Cisco in general is an amazing company to work for and our leaders are just that; intelligent, committed, individuals who strive to ensure our success. Customer Success is the new era of sales and I would highly reccomend this position. This role is unique in how it exposes you to the new way of not just selling products, but selling business outcomes. It's also exciting for those who like to innovate, value relationship-building with the customer, and pioneer new processes and ideas. I really enjoy being able to have direct impact at a company this big and being a member of the Customer Success Team here at Cisco gives you that unique opportunity. I can't emphasize enough the responsiveness of our executives and leaders; I'm honestly amazed at how Cisco has given new employees the ability to have exposure with our senior management and how willing and compasionate they are about our sales team. I would reccomend Cisco, Customer Success, and Sales to anyone, hands down.
","Working at a fortune 100 company as large as Cisco, especially as we migrate our revenue model and product offerings, means there will be holes. I think this is natural at any large company but the mindset of adapting to ever-changing processes, acquisitions, etc. is crucial in order to thrive. Not necessarily a con if you like a challenge and put in a lot of effort. No ""work from home"" but not necessarily a con either; I personally prefer to come in the office but just something to keep in mind as people have different views on this.

- Good benefits that are constantly being updated to be best in the industry - Compensation practices that encourage fair pay - Autonomy in job
Cons
- Cisco says their leaders are transparent and ""have your back,"" but leaders do not give feedback and won't help their employees progress in their careers. - All the acquisitions make Cisco a very segmented and unfair place. Different treatment for many of our big acquisitions still exist and their is no timeline to create a 1 Cisco mentality. - Management doesn't like the HR processes, systems, and tools created to make a transparent, listening, fair, and engaging environment so employees suffer.

We have internal trainings available but management dont give you the time to do it since they expect you to be almost 100% customer facing. - Bonuses are being cut off all the time. - Benefits are being cut. - Frequent management reorganization is distractive. - Everyone is trying to save their job so there are not many enabler managers. - Layoffs every 6 months and outsourcing jobs to 3rd party contractors offshore. - Don't expect this work to be 40 hours a week. most of us put double that.

","Issues that come with many x-large organizations. Layoffs occur very often. At least once a year. Upper management uses re-organizations as a way to solve problems which doesn't work. The bottom line overshadows growth. M&A is the strategy use to innovate which is a downside for internal employees.

","- Product: Working for Webex felt like you were part of a marketing hoax by Cisco, there is barely any integration to other business units and the revenue contributed to the overall revenue is only marginal, which leads to you not being taken seriously unless you are working on big deployments. - Management: There is no leadership in the UK. Fear-mongering and a passive aggressive attitude in team/individual meetings add to a strange and dampened atmosphere. (!) If the Software/Cloud Sales Lead calls himself ""the Supreme Leader"", then take this seriously, as its meaning is conveyed in his management style. Middle Management, many without any prior experience, is a mouthpiece of upper management. - Work Environment: Sadly, the environment is toxic and there is no sense of team atmosphere. There is an obvious segregation amongst team members. Multiple people have been fired in the past. - Compensation: Average to below average if you live in London. - Career Progression: No career progression (!). ""Senior"" positions are created for doing the same job and for little extra pay, you have no options to progress further unless you move to a different business unit, which some were able to do. - Location: You will be based in Feltham and you will not be allowed to work remotely (but it's Webex, right?) or in the City (unless it is an emergency or other circumstances).

","The company is greatly held back by the weight of its previous successes. Its flagship products (router/switches) are powered by an OS written in the early 90s. The groups that work on these products are typically 10 years behind the rest of the industry, and are so large that the rest of the company is held back by them. Management has been aware of this for years, and so has been acquiring other companies to do the development work that its core engineering groups are simply incapable of doing. This makes the company a bit schizophrenic as there is no real coordinated effort to move the company in a specific direction. This is not a condition unique to Cisco; Microsoft famously has similar problems with Windows. It does not make the company a bad one, but it's certainly not as forward looking as you might think. The siren call of several billion dollars a quarter for basically not changing *anything* is tough to ignore, and I certainly don't blame them for it. But as an engineer, it's frustrating to watch this happen.

The culture encourages collaboration, learning and gives the employee a place to broaden their horizons in terms of theirs skills and knowledge. Inclusive: CISCO believes in inclusive environment where everyone gets equal opportunity to grow and develop. It is not only inclusive in terms of people but also in terms of growth in recreational activities like sports and arts. It is quite difficult to find such a culture in other companies in India. - Awesome benefits: The benefits provided by CISCO is by far the best that I have known. The benefits include Health coverage for Family (yourself, spouse, children and parents or in-laws). This is quite rare compared to other companies health benefits. Free GYM, periodic health checkups for yourself, family and parents. Extremely well maintained sports facilities for shuttle, cricket, volley ball and basketball and various others. It supports tuition fee refund for any education/course you take. - Good Personal and Professional life balance: The work culture is flexible and allows the employee to maintain a balanced personal and professional life. Managers are very understanding and in general the management encourages the employee to ensure a good balance in work and personal life.

Business Outlook
Pros
I loved being challenged and learning new technologies. The people I worked with were like a family; everyone was always looking out for each other. The engineers I worked with were some of the most talented in the industry.
Cons
They started massive layoffs and are laying off good and critical people. They no longer care about the employees and only care about their quarterly earnings. Cisco keeps chasing innovation when they should be the innovators. They have the reputation of killing off products. Management changes every year will eventually hurt them. Just because it was successful while John Chambers was CEO doesn't mean they will be successful in the future. Always doing the same thing will not always result in success; by constantly changing management every year they are doing the SAME thing.

Bottom line: one quarter a year is lost because everyone around you is terrified of losing their job. 3. Engineering org is predominantly male and engineering leadership is almost universally male. It's easy to get used to men talking over you in meetings, and promoting your ideas as their own. 4. There is a lot of finger pointing at Cisco. People have a lot of responsibility but little accountability. 5. Extremely hierarchical. You talk to your manager, they talk to their manager, that manager talks to their manager.

2017-06-29,Anonymous,,"Former Employee, more than 5 years",Cisco - Hit or Miss,"As with every company, you can have an amazing experience or an extremely poor experience, depending on who your manager is at Cisco. I've had two extremely poor experiences and two amazing experiences. Cisco is struggling with changing their culture amidst huge IT changes in the industry. Customers and partners are evolving and Cisco has to evolve to adapt. This leads to continual layoffs/restructuring, inability to retain good talent, and extremely poor management. If you have an amazing manager, you will have a great combination of work life balance. You may work 50+ hours, but still have the ability to attend your kids sports/school activities, field trips etc, and still be considered an effective employee. The benefits are great also, there are many opportunities for employees to reap financial benefits in the way of bonuses (if the company is doing well,) ESPP stock purchasing and 401K. The company will take care of you while you are working for them.
","If you have a poor manager, you will be micro managed, texted while you're on PTO, and harassed to the point where your only option is to find another position either within or outside of the company. Such is the case with any company, there are good and bad managers. Cisco seems to have more bad managers than good ones. They have some major middle management issues that they need to take care of. They've effectively gotten rid of 360 feedback which prevents employees from having the ability to rate their managers, but on a team of less than 5 people, it's easy for the manager to figure out who's providing ""bad"" feedback, so they can be targeted or managed out.

","That being said, it is a white, male, sales dominated company and that is a very powerful legacy that is hard to break away from. From the ""play"" events (Golf, Vegas etc), to the silly badge clips that only work with belt loops, everything still screams ""we cater to men"". It's not malicious and change is coming but it's hard and it will take time. Also, parental leave is pathetic. As a CA company it should follow CA law, instead the follow whatever minimum is required by law in your state which makes it very unfair for non-California moms.

","Work Life Balance Very High Goals Extremely Political Nepotism Poor Management Strategy In Our Segment New ""Collaborative"" Environment has us packed like sardines and is VERY loud Over the last 18 months there has been major changes in Cisco as a whole. Some of this change is for the good. Especially our moving to more of a licensing model. The main issue is that goals have shot through the roof and the culture has been hit drastically. Prior to these changes we had the freedom to work in an atmosphere that promoted and strong work/life balance and a culture that was second to none. Our team was one of the most successful in all of Cisco and you could not find a person on our team that was unhappy with the culture/environment. Now it's hard to find someone that wouldn't jump ship if the opportunity presented itself. As for goals, the first few years of my tenure with Cisco our uplifts year over year ranged from 12% - 20% which, dependent on territory, gave everyone the opportunity to be successful. My personal goals for the last couple years have exceeded 50% year over year growth and I know of teammates who's goals have exceeded 80%. When your OTE (On Target Earnings) are based on a 50/50 salary to commission structure, this kills your income.

We can stay connected anywhere without feeling any real difference whichever location you are in, may it be in one of the colorful couches or rooms in the office or at the comfort of your own home.

2017-06-26, Software Engineer,Galway,"Current Employee, more than 5 years",Some positives but also many negatives,"Possible to work from home. Good benefits - Free health insurance. Buy up to 5 days extra holidays. Good work life balance. Everyone I work with are genuine and nice people. Get to work with modern technologies, environments and programming languages. The products we are working on very new and so you do get to spend a good bit of time actually coding new features vs just bug fixing etc. Good hardware for work. Very good to the wider community and are continuously raising money for good causes.
","No career progression. Very possible to get stuck in same position / salary for years on end in this company. Seem to have no budget for career advancement at the moment. Very difficult to stay motivated. Good engineering practices are not always recognized. Management say they care about quality but only seem to reward engineers who produce at speed but cause many bugs in our products. Actions speak louder than words. No team structure. You don't know what you will be working on week to week. Very varied. Can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on the person. Not what I like in a work place environment. Very frugal in general with employees i.e Don't help pay for Christmas Party. We used to have release parties but since we are releasing on a continuous basis this has all dried up. Again no recognition to the dedication of employees. Since we develop communications applications there is a culture of always being online and it can be common to seeing people replying to messages at 11 - 12pm at night. Can be very difficult to switch off. Management don't directly encourage this but also don't try to curb this behavior. Canteen is expensive for what you get. Cisco didn't provide the catering contractor and canteen staff with the proper facilities so they have to make do with pre made factory food and microwaves. Food seems highly processed and as such the quality isn't very good. Vending machines have no healthy options. Senior Management are more obsessed with image i.e Winning Great Place To Work instead of actually improving the work environment for employees. I feel that management don't listen to employees concerns. I had many experiences of engineers on the team voicing common sense concerns about the direction of the product to management only to fall on deaf ears. Eventually the customer voiced the same concerns and so we ended up wasting countless engineering hours backtracking on previous work. This has happened on many occasions. Over the last number of years there has been annual redundancies with out fail. It has actually affected the Galway site a couple of times. One year a whole team was let go. This was without consideration to the performance of individual members of the team. So it doesn't matter how good you are you could still be let go at anytime.

It is a solid company with great compensation and benefits compared to other companies within the same market. Good work-life balance. Management stimulates and accepts open and honest feedback.

People think sometimes that when you work for a large company like Cisco, you'll somehow get overlooked. But I can tell you that's not the case. You get to work with the smartest people in the industry who truly believe in educating and enabling their employees. Everyday, I feel like I've made an impact, and that my value is being recognized. I advocate everyday for my friends to work here because it is absolutely the best place to be. Customer Success is taking the industry by storm right now, and there is not a better company to be working with. Cisco has always been a thought leader, and they recognize how critical Customer Success is for our customers. I can't wait to see how this group grows and transforms within the coming months. It's one of the most rewarding careers being able to work so closely with customers to truly understand their business, and how we can help them reach their business outcomes. If you want to learn, grow and be surrounded by passionate, motivated people - this is where you'll find them!
","It's a newer team, so naturally there are still some things they are trying to work out in terms of what technology we align to and other little nuances... but it doesn't take away from the value you deliver as a CSM or the overall experience of working there. It's more of a growing pain than a con! :)

In fact, they enable you to have a better work/ life balance by providing the equipment and ways of working so you can be highly effective from home. I work 4 days per week from home on average (I have the option to work fewer if I want to). Cisco offers all the benefits you'd expect including you birthday as an additional day off, a choice of high end Mac or PC, phone bill paid in full, 5 additional days off to volunteer for the organisation of your choice (this year I'm using mine to go on a long cycling trip for a charity started by one of my colleague's. You can also receive connected recognition, this is a cash reward of varying amounts you receive from colleagues who think you went above and beyond. I received one last month for £70 but the amounts can be over £100. Aside from all of this, the people are great and together we make a fun friendly culture. It's work hard, play hard and Cisco certainly rewards all those who do. A great choice of tech company whether you have technical skills or not.

Doing this over and over is demoralizing. Many of my co-workers only stay because they don't think they can find a remote job that will pay as well. Not exactly inspiring.

","Management became a bit top- and middle- heavy. Large company problems, projects would be cancelled (usually justifiably!) later than they should have been.

Overtime, their products either get eliminated or outsourced and the original group gets laid off. - Annual layoffs which nurture a sub-optimal culture. It does not matter if you are really good or not. if you happened to be on the wrong project, you can be impacted. - Annual peer ranking to feed into the annual layoffs.

I can only imagine how wonderful this flexibility will be when I'm a mother some day.

Cisco encourages its employees to always be trained and up-to-date and offers free training to their employees. Cisco is a financially stable company and offers peace of mind, and Cisco will also ensure that its employees grow professionally within the company. Employees are free to work from home whenever they want, there are no inconveniences to request permission to go out to solve personal issues, that is Cisco is very flexible.
","In Cisco sometimes there are many strategic changes at the organizational level and this causes employees not to be clear business objectives and it is also possible that by these changes one group of employees has a manager and another manager another month.

2017-04-18,Anonymous,,Current Employee,Sales Review,"-You have an opportunity to make a lot of money if you're in the right place at the right time. -There is always opportunity to move internally. I've seen people promote from sales to management, move to a product specialist role, move to the channels side or a strategic operation position, or just change sales job from territory to larger accounts. -Just about any hiring manager you reach out to will be open to talking with you. It's cultural to talk to anyone who reaches out and help each other. -Very generous benefits and PTO -There is no shortage of resources for sales to engage to help win deals. -Less pressure at the end of the month than many sales organizations, though of course there is still pressure and it's part of any sales job. There is a larger focus on annual quota than month to month though which is nice considering seasonality. -Breadth and depth of solutions we can sell is unmatched. -Sales tools / technology and integrations are very good and user friendly compared to some other companies.
","-There seems to be high turnover in management. Managers aren't necessarily leaving the company, though some are, but I've seen many moving internally. It's not uncommon to have a manager for one year only. That doesn't have to be a bad thing but it's something to be aware of if you really like your hiring manager and that's effecting your decision. -Like with any large company, it can be very time consuming to find the right person to help for a specific issue. There are always people to help and resources, but finding them is half the battle. You can't always get quick answers or results for your customers because of this. -Annual layoffs have a definite impact on morale. Loss of resources due to the layoff coupled with subpar communication can make it difficult to pull in the right resource at a certain time of the year and slow down your business and sales cycle. -Account list tends to change every year.

2017-04-10, Software Engineer,"San Jose, CA","Current Employee, more than 1 year","Had good experiences during internships, but full-time is a different story","+ Internships were enjoyable because I got to work on small but interesting projects in an easygoing environment. That said, compensation is very much below average compared to other tech companies in Silicon Valley. + Work/life balance is good. Rarely is anyone ever expected to work more than 40 hours per week. This might depend on your group though. + They are making a good effort to update their offices in San Jose from the old cubicle farms to the newer open-floor setups with free amenities (coffee/tea/espresso, snacks, etc.). + They do not skimp on developer machines and peripherals like monitors, headphones, etc.
","- Very bureaucratic, lots of reorgs and movement at the middle and upper levels (e.g. new directors, mid-level managers, upper-level managers). - The pay is below average in comparison to other tech companies in the Bay Area. Promotions/raises seem to be few and far between. It will soon be my third year here, and all of my developer peers have also complained about slow growth within the company. - Due to the bureaucratic nature of the company, communication among the many groups is slow and sporadic. - It may be different for other groups, but there seems to be a general lack of expertise when it comes to software development best practices: -- Everything is hacked together -- Quantity of features and speed of development > quality and stability -- There are no design/architecture discussions that include all of the developers (""design"" of the product usually happens as informal conversations between mid-to-senior level developers, without including the newer/entry-level developers). These discussions are ad-hoc, informal, and often not even documented. -- No standards followed for releases/deployment -- Very little effort spent on documentation of anything -- We are one of the many groups that tries to follow Agile/Scrum, but since we don't follow a lot technical practices that actual make Agile work (e.g. unit tests, code reviews, decent documentation, reasonably-sized & well-defined user stories, etc.), it isn't working as it should. The end result is shoddy code and constantly accumulating technical debt. - People in non-technical roles (middle managers and product owners) push for features and user stories without really knowing what they want. User stories are often a terse title and an empty description (no behavioral/functional specifications, no summary, no consideration for inter-dependencies among other user stories). - Projects often lack clear direction. This point applies to my group and our project, but I think it might apply to other groups as well. There are many technical leaders in our group, but for our project, we lack a TRUE lead technical architect who: 1) has a clear vision of what the product should be like 2) plans architecture & development tasks for the group 3) mentors less experienced developers 4) maintains standards on code quality and development processes Bottom line: If you're looking for a place to hone your technical skills and grow as a developer, look elsewhere. Some of the other reviewers who mentioned a culture of complacency absolutely hit the nail on the head. I have observed first-hand many times where our group has accepted mediocre work or shortcuts without hesitation ""if it gets the job done,"" creating more technical debt. When developers ask for time to address technical debt, we are rebuffed by managers who claim that it is ""good enough"" and that we should focus on pumping out more features. If you stay here too long, your skills as a software developer will only continue to rust.

Business Outlook
Pros
Still has a good work/life balance - you control your diary and management generally back you up Good customer contacts - not many organisations that won't at least entertain Cisco Good perks - some of the benefits are very good
Cons
Terrible technology - constant failure to execute in cloud/software. Promises made and broken continuously. Backstabbing colleagues - I worked with one extremely nasty piece of work who'd constantly backstab people and put them down. When half the team issued a formal complaint he got a payrise and an award from management instead! Best they could do was apologise to us... No willingness to listen to problems - 6 months of dire morale and a collapsing team yet no one took any time to listen, understand or fix it. The team I was in lost 5 or more people in 6 months because of this. Not one of them got an exit interview. Petty politics - lots of power struggles and empire building at the expense of anyone's hopes and dreams. AMs and PSS treated like rockstars whilst SEs thought of as resources to book and use like meeting rooms. No sales apititude - most sales people happily admit they don't understand what they're selling. An embarassment that would be met with complete shame in any other line of work. The worst are the so-called sales experts. No career prospects - once upon a time you could look at the big pyramid that is Cisco and see how you could progress. Now there's nowhere to go other than to do the same job with the occaisional payrise to keep you in your place. LR used as a stick when people get old and/or expensive.

","Not the great company it once was... Moral is at an all time low, with large numbers of people at Cisco currently looking at leaving or waiting in the hope they are made redundant, many have already jumped ship and are now working for better companies with much, much better packages... Lack of innovation and strategy across nearly their entire product set is a big concern, and management seem to have no idea how to fix things.. Cisco are rapidly falling through the ranks of Best Places to Work too - 8th place in 2015, and just two years later now down at 26th place (which doesn't surprise anyone based on what's been happening there over the last two years) Don't take my word for it though, search 'Cisco' on layoff dotcom and see what others are saying, many of which are still there hoping things will change!! Just my personal opinion - but I reckon if you have worked for a decent company before, you will only have regret if you join Cisco in it's current state.

Cons
-Way too many frequent org. changes which makes you feel less motivated as this changes in no way benefits to a engineer but only management and business. - Salary in Advanced Services is average which according to me is poor standard when compared to other big IT companies. - Flexibility in work hours and work from home does not mean pay less. Actually you end up working more hours from home. - Advanced services always have budget issues and there are tons of people to compete for promotions. - Management need to make sure not to create same processes and giving it different names. It just confuses what model to follow. - Too many processes are created by Directors/Managers just for the heck of to show management is doing something better in terms of time management and fast learning for engineers to come up to speed. -You get trained but never implement all of what you learn and hence another waste of dollars on training. - Way too many people out there in the company wanting to prove themselves. -You get promotions based on amount of years spent at the company and not based on your achievements. - They will make you do the same work as the done by higher grade people and still less pay.

2017-01-23, Sales Engineer,Amsterdam,Former Employee,Cisco Systems Netherlands,"This review concerns the Sales organisation. Cisco offers some great opportunities for engaging with top clients in a broad range of technologies. Although some claim work culture is tough, I can't agree with that: it may be demanding, but there is room for initiative and good initiatives get rewarded in a fair manner. Working culture with collegues is informal and pleasant. For sales engineers there are many opportunities for ongoing learning on new technologies.
","Being a large gobal company it is very top-down oriented. there is little room for strategic initiatives within the country organisations. If you fit well in the strategic plan, you have a wonderful job, if not, there is hardly room for changing this. For account managers specifically: Cisco is strongly steering on monthly revenue commits, resulting in a rather short term vision for many AM's. Only the High Touch AM's will have the opportunity for a more long-term approach. This is something you like or don't.

- Great for Grads as a starting point - Nice Staff at technical level -initially supportive
Cons
- CoE system will promise you a promotion if you do X and Y. Only when i handed in my notice did i find out they had promised 10 people in the same CoE a promotion with only 1 spot availible, despite it being oversure for all of them - Management do not give a damn about technical staff. Most technical staff move over to presales - You can be forced out of your area of expertise then expected to start from scratch. For example Getting a second CCIE when you already have one with no training allowance or lab kit. - If you are technical you get no credit. Walk a customer to sales that then results in a multi-million dollar deal? You won't even get a thank you on a company quarterly meeting, the presales guy that sat in two meetings does though

2017-01-20, Technical Leader/Escalation Team Lead,"San Jose, CA","Current Employee, more than 3 years","Been a great ride, but might be time for me to move on","I have been at Cisco for almost 2 decades and have been blessed with the opportunity to perform 7 different roles over that time. There is almost always a way to reinvent or morph yourself given the wide range of opportunities. The compensation has been pretty fair for the past decade or so. It really helped that I've had some top-notch managers that have gone to bat for me with HR. My last two managers have been pretty awful, but *all* of the ones prior had my back and helped me grow my career... even if they knew it meant I'd move on to bigger and better things. I can't state that strongly enough. I have never been as happy with my immediate manager in any job as I have been at Cisco (save the past year or two). Cisco prides itself on hiring the right folks - as anyone subjected to the myriad of interviews can attest - and I have to say they generally hit home runs. 90%+ of the people I work with have been excellent, self-starting, and knew their stuff - or learned it on-the-job and jumped right in.
","I know that Stack Ranking gets a bum rap, but you know who really likes it?.. folks who rank well and bust their backsides to get there. With the move to ""The People Deal"" (still have no idea WTF that means), Stack Ranking went away - as did the RSUs. I get nearly 1/3 of my total compensation from RSUs, so these are the ""golden handcuffs"" that keep me here. No more RSUs, no more cuffs, perhaps time to look elsewhere. Why leave? I have been on the cutting edge of new markets for Cisco for be better part of the last decade. These are places where they make big bets, but quickly grow into a bureaucratic model that sells its soul to the first customer to sign a PO, then slowly drown and sink as that customer (or customers) weigh us down and not pivot with the rest of the market. As I look around the landscape and view Cisco's attempts to pivot to Cloud and recurring revenue models, it is very clear that they are not learning from these failures. They burn out or run off all of the folks who could help prevent the next failure, thus do not learn the lesson. Or, in other cases, they do not allow enough time to get things rolling. You basically have 3 years to be #1/2 in the market - or else. Reference the recent death of Intercloud as an example of what I mean. They committed $1 billion to the project, but had a massively flawed business model from the start. After all, who can compete with AWS when it comes to plain IaaS? They were far too late to bring the other table stakes bits that go along with that (VPNaaS, LBaaS, FWaaS, Big Data as a Service, etc). Many of those were just about to launch when they canned the entire engineering portion of the project. One of the major distractions - and reasons for the delay in getting that stuff in place - was being saddled with their two external partners. These partners contracted one thing, then asked for a wildly different deployment model or Roles and Responsibilities. These held back any further evolution and improvement of the platform. Don't get me wrong: We screwed up alot, too, but those early commitments killed our velocity and ability to pivot.

","If you are young in your career Cisco can be a nightmare. Managers have absolutely no idea what you do from day to day and seem to care little about that. You can go months without talking to your manager if you want. Managers couldn't care less about your professional development. Having sync up calls with your manager to discuss development is literally a joke because they will help you with nothing. Cisco is losing talent fast and a big reason is because they pay poor, the company is too bureaucratic for career growth, and management is completely lousy. In my four years at Cisco I've had 5 or 6 managers and I can only say that one of them was a good/great one. Oh and I almost forgot. If you are early in your career forget about proper training. Cisco is absolutely horrendous and training new talent for the work force. This is literally a sink or swim company. You come in on your first day after a couple years out of college and your manager is looking at you to close million dollar deals with no proper product, role, or field training. They'll just say figure it out or browse the companies 70k people to find someone who can give you advice. They don't even assign you a mentor. The ability for people to work from home has turned the office to a ghost town so if you enjoy he presence of other human being you better forget about it here.

Often hard working employees are ignored because they are not loud enough to speak up and they are quiet and most of the time, management or another person takes credit for the work that someone else did.

Fast steep learning and personal development. High levels of team work and collaboration. People are empowered and each individual is respected. Focus on results. Processes do not get in the way.
","Not many cons. I loved every single minute of working at Cisco. At the time I was there, there was not a lot of gender diversity. Although people can work from home, there is limited work life balance. Promotions were scarce (stable structure).

","There are not enough Engineers at top positions. Most decisions and product road maps are developed with $$ in mind. Too many 'non-functional' managers that don't understand the details and can't go-to-bat for their groups. We frequently talk about 'wonder what that Director does all day'
