","Outdated technologies, and it's hard to integrate new technologies to the existing products since they're very old and complicated and there's a lot of legacy code. You should take that into account that you'd be considerably behind the times once you return to the market. Very hard to get a raise. No bonuses. As a woman, men got higher pay doing the same job.

Pros
SAP is an employer that is offering great opportunities and benefits for anyone interested in career growth. It has a very diverse portfolio, so you get the chance to work on different projects that are relevant for your career goals. Here you can find great consultants to learn from and can continuously improve yourself.
Cons
Some of the products in SAP's portfolio are using quite outdated technology, so they might not be very attractive to engineers interested in applying the latest tech trends. However, SAP is continuously innovating and you can always create yourself the opportunity to apply trending tech.

2020-09-29, Technical Program Manager,"Newtown Square, PA","Current Employee, more than 3 years",Join if you want to make the company better,"SAP North America's benefits are slightly above average for a company of its size. They have pretty standard dental, medical, vision, 401k, parental leave, and PTO. One perk is unlimited sick days. Their employee equity plan has relatively no strings attached. The one downside is that they partner with an obscure company out of the UK. Customer service is poor, and their investor portal has a lackluster UI. The people are nice, and everyone is well-adjusted to remote work. They don't mind kids or dogs in the background of virtual meetings. A perk (at least for me) is that SAP does not require video during virtual meetings. There's sort of an unspoken rule not to use video. I personally enjoy it. I can dress comfortably, and I'm not distracted about how I look on camera. North American leadership is very community minded. When tragedy strikes, they respond. They've created relief programs for natural disaster victims. After George Floyd was killed, they hosted multiple All Hands sessions and diversity education sessions. They testified in front of Congress. Even now that Black Lives Matter isn't making headlines, they continue to promote minority causes and small businesses. They are not afraid to ""get political."" One of SAP's core values is inclusion, and North American leadership works hard to foster that. SAP in principle is a progressive, equal opportunity employer. For example, they had training about non-binary individuals before it became ""mainstream."" They also have an Autism at Work program. It's very possible that you'll work with people who are all over the world. It can be very rewarding (and something to brag about). The North American offices are LEED certified, which means they pass stringent environmental standards.
","Right now, the SAP I love looks very different. From my perspective, global leadership's attitude has been essentially, ""Shut up and do what I say."" They don't understand or care about how our internal processes work. They've forced us to roll out solutions that aren't ready for customers, or solutions that customers don't even want. In order to meet their deadlines, we have to implement complex manual workarounds to get the job halfway finished. To be fair to current global leadership, SAP's processes were complicated before. Unfortunately, selling has always been the primary goal. We have a poor track record of actually delivering quality service. But the current pressures we're facing are making things worse. Add all of the COVID complications, and now you have a place that really isn't fun to work. Though SAP's pledge of inclusion is admirable, it is not always practiced. Hiring practices can be elitist. To be frank, leadership is primarily white men and high caste Indian men. Our current Board is all white, mostly German, and only has one woman (there will be two when 2021 starts). Our first female Co-CEO—a loyal, beloved member of SAP—""parted ways"" with the company less than a year after she was appointed. Overall, I am disappointed in the current state of the company. I think it has potential to be a great company, but not with the current people in charge. If you want to make the company a better place to work, then please join us. If you're just looking for a job, I recommend looking elsewhere.

When you walk into a meeting with a customer, you are looked at not as a software provider but as an advisor to the business. This is because the offerings that SAP brings to its customers are often the market defining products. So we have a direct influence in shaping the markets that we operate in. Having worked in the software industry for the last 15 years, I can say that it’s not just the products of SAP but also the employee policies here that are a topic of envy. And this is not just related to the remuneration. SAP takes a genuine effort in its employee well-being through a host of engagements. Right from day one you get the feeling that you are part of a large family and it creates a true sense of belongingness and camaraderie. SAP is quick to adopt and very often at the forefront in defining employee policies that are in step with the changing dynamics of the workforce. From a career progression standpoint, the worldwide presence of SAP and the comprehensive portfolio of products, made it possible for me to explore multi-disciplinary and multi-region career options. Overall the combination of a market leading product with a truly employee centric philosophy is what makes the SAP culture stand out on its own.

2020-09-22, Partner Business Manager,Singapore,Current Employee,Hiring practices & culture,"based on merit. this company definitely promotes internal hiring first. Although there is a current hiring freeze within the company, no team member has been let go in lieu of the COVID-19 pandemic. Roles are still available and open to internal hires. Staff have been advised to WFH entirely but the office remains open for those who wants to break the monotony of WFH (standard social distancing and masking measures are in place). This is a company that shows trust in its most important resource - people. Employee benefits remain very very competitive in this industry. On-boarding process established and stable, expect a smooth experience for first day. Equipment, credentials, passes, would have all been made ready prior.

2020-08-28, Vice President ,"San Francisco, CA","Current Employee, more than 10 years","Great place to work, learn, grow and continuously develop","Despite being the world’s industry leader for business software, SAP managed to keep a “small team” feeling - where colleagues work in a respectful and agile way. Key focus has been, and is, to deliver value for SAP’s customers (internal and external). From smaller enhancements to reimagining entirely new business processes, SAP brings some of the smartest people in the industry together to drive and solve tomorrow’s technology innovations. Knowing that a majority of the world’s economic activities are processed on SAP systems, and seamlessly connecting producers of goods with consumers, makes us proud. Knowing that many of our technologies and financial contributions are used to help and better the life’s of less fortunate world citizens, shows commitment to purpose and heart. SAP’s management solicits and uses employee feedback in its daily business practices resulting in an environment of trust, respect, and genuine practice of “employees are the most valuable asset”. Being part of the SAP family means, one never runs out of options to further develop, learn, grow, and take advantage of opportunities. There are thousands of colleagues that are ready to support, be it for business mentorship, a personal challenge, or simply to have a friendly competition of encouraging fitness tracking as part of work-life balance and a healthy lifestyle. SAP has generous benefits and pay – which is only one part of the equation. The boundless opportunities, with learning opportunities, advice and mentorship – as well as the ability to work with and learn from top international industry talent is a priceless experience not many companies can match. I can highly recommend SAP to anyone looking for a true opportunity that goes beyond of just being a job.
","At times, the things that make SAP such a great company, like individuality, innovation, autonomy in one’s job, can be the biggest challenge. Establishing a good network of key contacts from day one is a must, and allows tracking and following of new developments across the entire organization – even outside one’s business area. Find a good mentor and be prepared to work in a “team work” approach. While working remote might be acceptable, working closer to an official office location may also help with establishing those relationships (though most leadership is distributed throughout the world, as in many global companies). SAP being an European company, the treatment of employees is very fair and considerate (maybe more so than many US companies) yet they are not immune to continuous changes in the industry, which leads to organizational enhancements from time to time (for the most part not reductions, yet changes in managers or teams). These will be easier to digest with a good network and a positive attitude in place.

2020-08-27, Senior Software Engineer,,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","SAP may be okay, but life at the Concur subsidiary is misery","I honestly can't think of any. All of the ones I can think of would be disguised insults.
","Concur cares about you. They think. As long as you are exactly the same as everyone else at Concur. As long as you don't complain about anything that happens to you at Concur. As long as you keep your head down. As long as you don't ask for any assistance from outside your team. As long as you don't complain when your assignments are literally impossible without assistance that you can't get. (As long as you can prove that you were working very hard and producing a product, it doesn't matter that it does not and cannot work.) Concur seems to have a management training program which turns out people who exult in trying to make every employee like every other employee. Two employees have different strengths? NOT ON MY WATCH. We will not assign people to tasks that they excel at. And if we accidentally do, then we will make sure that, if your task is not high status, you will not get any promotions or significant pay increases, no matter how important that job is. Nothing gets done at Concur unless you know someone. Filing a ticket because you need a static IP address at your desk, so you can do tests? It won't be denied, it will simply languish for six months, until you contact this guy you know who tells you who would know who to talk to, and three hours later you've tracked down someone to take care of your problem, and an hour after that it's done. Woe betide the remote employee who doesn't start out with an automatic support network of the people in the offices near him. HR/benefits is never your friend. Example: you read the rules of how the 401k matching works (updated for this year!) on the company's benefits web site, and schedule your 401k contributions accordingly. Except the matches don't come in properly. So you file an HR ticket, which gets ignored. So you go and find the appropriate person via networking (see above) and say 'look this isn't working how your document says it should'. And they say 'wait where did you get that document' and you say '...the benefits web site?' And two hours later they write you an email saying 'thank you for pointing out that document, it was wrong and we have removed it and the right document is elsewhere and it says that you're going to lose out on several thousand dollars this year and that is not our problem.' And if you want your money, that you were entitled to according to their own document, you will have to sue them, because not giving you the money you were entitled to is a hill that they will die on. HR/benefits makes a LOT of mistakes. For example, issuing incorrect W2s, and then having to correct them, and issuing incorrect CORRECTIONS, and having to correct THOSE. And then next year issuing incorrect W2s AGAIN. Like 'accidentally' taking double the legal amount for HSAs out of your paycheck, and then telling you that they couldn't correct it themselves, and that you would have to do so (even though the HSA contractor they use says that it's their responsibility to correct it). And then in order to correct it making you sign a document that says 'the undersigned has been advised to discuss this with a CPA or a tax law expert' and then refusing to pay for you to discuss this with a CPA or a tax law expert. Even though they are the ones who created the problem in the first place. Like giving people the wrong cell phone reimbursement policy, and then after they've put in their expenses for the first two months, telling them that that was not the right policy and that it was their responsibility to know what the right policy was. Like their parent company (SAP) having an on-call-time pay policy, and Concur accidentally allowing on-call-time reimbursement for one person, but when the other people who are on call and want to be paid for it too ask for it, Concur discovering their 'error' and lecturing them on how all developers should be DevOps and should expect to be on call 24/7 as part of their job description. This despite mediocre pay and benefits, no stock options, and crappy bonuses. ""Look, if you have to work from 5 AM until 7 PM on January 1st, hung over, and you miss a party you were looking forward to for weeks, that is not our problem. Maybe you can ask your manager for a day off. But not two days off. That would be crazy."" The most astonishing thing about working at Concur is that there are still some good people there. I can't imagine how, though.

2020-08-12, Customer Success,,"Current Employee, more than 8 years","overall, a solid place to have a career","As a whole, SAP is a great company to work for. It's successful and stable, the pay and benefits are competitive, and the corporate culture is extremely conducive to establishing a long-term career with the company. Generally speaking, once you're at SAP and have established yourself as a solid performer, the company makes it relatively easy to explore other roles in other areas of the company, and many people take advantage of this flexibility and enjoy long and happy tenures with the company. SAP is constantly changing, which can be frustrating for some, but it definitely helps keep things interesting and is a necessary part of adapting to the needs of the market. The fact that our CEO openly encouraged employees to submit Glassdoor reviews says a lot about him.
","Like any large company, there's a potential for politics to come into play; and like any job, whether you love or hate it will be largely dependent on your boss, the leadership of your specific organization, and the culture they establish. Management opportunities can often be based on personal connections over merit. There seem to be lots of examples of people quickly jumping from the bottom of the company into very high level positions after working in ""the office of the CEO"" but how those opportunities are assigned is a mystery to most employees. SAP also touts a focus on ""diversity and inclusion"" - while it does seem that we have at least some diversity in the lower ranks, diversity in leadership is severely lacking. There is a clear focus on promoting women into leadership positions (there is even a stated goal for that) but so far, that seems to be limited to caucasian women. Having been at SAP almost a decade, I can't think of a single upper management position held by a person of color.

Pros
So many pros -- the pay, benefits, vacation time, work/life balance, parental leave. Higher ups at SAP really do care about our wellbeing. SAP's response to the COVID-19 crisis was phenomenal and showed great leadership. They immediately closed all their offices and training centers and shut down all non-essential travel. They sent free masks to all their employees, and gave us all an extra day off to get out of our home offices. Although in some cases, SAP is known for older technologies and interfaces, that isn't often the case anymore, and you can join a group work on cutting edge technologies. SAP does a great job promoting internally and allowing employees to move around to different roles and positions while staying within the company. If I ever decide to change my role, I know that I want to stay with SAP.
Cons
A lot of optional benefits you can take advantage of at SAP, like tuition benefits, fellowships, etc., is all determined by your direct manager's approval. This is extremely disadvantageous to those of us at SAP with managers that don't believe in these opportunities and don't want to use any of their budget for these items. More importantly, your ability to move up in your career is determined by your direct manager, and this is an extreme disadvantage with some of the managers they've hired. Also, it is very difficult to get fired from SAP, which means that poor performers at both management-level and individual contributors get shuffled around to new groups rather than getting let go, which brings down all of SAP with their lower standards.

2020-08-11, Director,,"Current Employee, less than 1 year",Global Company and truly inclusive - love the culture!!,"SAP is always striving to be better than they currently are. They are strategic customer centric and community focused. I am very impressed with the care for employees during the COVID crisis, taking a regular pulse of employees and addressing their needs like mental health, work from home challenges , childcare challenges, social justice issues etc. They offered additional matching funds for BLM and social justice organizations. They have a focus on sustainability and partner with not for profits for volunteer opportunities. They have invited guest speakers to open our minds to the challenges facing society and allow people to ask questions in a safe environment. I can go on and on.
","Being a global company, the downside is the need to work early/late hours to meet European and Asian Time Zones, working from the US. Also need more diversity on the board.

2020-08-10, Vice President Sales Strategy and Operations,"Vancouver, BC","Current Employee, more than 10 years",Best place to work!,"One of the best things about working for SAP is the abundance of opportunities across multiple parts of the business. Across my 10+ years with the organization, I've had the opportunity to work on many different strategic initiatives. I genuinely feel like I am influencing decisions with the work I am doing. Second thing I love about SAP, is the flexibility around work hours and location. I've always had an appreciation for this benefit but now during the pandemic it has been reinforced. Upper levels of management are very supportive of working outside of a regular ""9 to 5"" work day. Some days I start early and end early, or other days I work a bunch of blocks throughout the day to get my tasks completed. Third item I love about working for SAP is the generous days off. It is unusual to get this many days off in North America. I never feel like I'm going to ""run out"" of days.

They even sent all employees reusable cloth masks to use and kept us update on the current Covid-19 situation worldwide. Prior to all this it was great going into work and meeting with colleagues and eating lunch together.

I have even heard complaints from other countries talk about this. - No regard for career/career growth. Many reorgs and you are just placed anywhere. I have seen engineers/developers moved into communications and marketing. Same for product dev/mgrs who specialize in UI/UX and developing tech/software products reorged to roles that have very little to do with their skills. - The leaders frown upon workers trying to move into other organizations. Example: An ex-CIO or Big 4 MD wanting to move back into the more tech side or services orgs from Advisory. - Cloud strategy and cloud-readiness is still lacking - Partner strategy should look to cloud and more products than HANA. HANA products should focus more on top cloud services and position as solutions(ie. HANA integration w/IIoT data intensive solutions as well as analytics & ML services) as well as SAP solutions for faster and greater Time -to-value (TTV) for partners and clients (this helps all succeed) - Need to integrate across all SAP tech more. - Real strategy & change on services esp. with partners which can drive exponential growth and not just re-positioning and marketing what we have. When working with partners need to want to succeed thru & with them not as an avenue to sell your product or services. Use a reseller for that. - Too many cooks problem....to get something done, everyone comes out of the woodwork wanting to be in meetings but never wanting to do the work or own the issues and challenges just the rewards. This is a huge delay in accomplishing things. - No real sales, marketing, product and growth strategy. Just words and no execution. Sales is transactional ""hoping"" to resell to existing customers. No real bus dev & expansion. Lots of gatekeeping with the excuse that a mistake was made several years ago. - Ageism is a beast here and it is discrimination. ""I want younger"", ""I want older"". I want diverse with skills and experience. I've seen multi-gen teams work.

Pros
The company is financially secure and your employment probably will be as well. Good benefits and generally kind people. In my experience, your managers actually want you to take your vacation and care about work/life balance. If you're good at your job, you can get a hefty amount of restricted stock pretty regularly. A lot of job opportunities at the company are internal only, so there's a pretty normalized culture around hunting for new jobs within SAP. This gives you ways to grow when you inevitably hit your team's ceiling.
Cons
There's a lot of division of responsibility. This means unless you're lucky enough to be in an influential pocket of the company, your ability to do things quickly or have an impact is HEAVILY blunted. Worse, a lot of the teams you'll need to work with to do your job are pretty poorly-performing. Diversity is lacking, especially among leadership. The people in charge are mostly German men. Since a lot of functions are global, even people based in the US will often have layer upon layer of male German managers. Reorganizations are a constant fact of life and often seem based more on political power struggles for headcount than any logical ordering of labor. If you're lucky, you'll keep your direct manager and impact is often manageable. If you're unlucky... well thankfully it's only happened to me once.

2020-08-03, Senior Product Support Engineer,,"Current Employee, more than 10 years",SAP Product Support Division - Needs improvement,"SAP in General is a good company with wonderful benefits. It gives the employees room to grow and gives them wonderful extra time to help your family cope with any troubles in life. SAP also tries to fulfill best in employment salary and bonus structures.
","While SAP as a company offers great benefits, the problem is within the Product Support division. People who may apply for Support engineering role should look elsewhere due to the reasons below. In Product Support there are two main tasks (i.e. could be inhumane too), that is so tough that it requires you or forces you to work nights and weekends. I) First task: Man the Expert Chat Channel. Why is this so tough? First there is not a lot of people who may help here (or it adds a lot more work to your daily requirements). If you somehow walk away to go to the bathroom or you are helping other customers online, there would be a flag or an alarm to management that there is nobody manning the chat (Or you are not manning the chat). This makes employees start to feel anxious to the point that SAP Product Support becomes a very stressful environment (i.e. unhealthy). - If going to the bathroom gives an employee stress then this is simply a requirement that is inhumane (HR issue) - This makes employees very stress to the point that they may quit the company (which happens a lot in SAP) - Turn over is pretty big - This task also adds to the overwhelming number of requirements that the support engineer needs to do daily - This is also going to be recorded in a report that is available to management - how long did you logon to Chat? They can use this number against you. For example: If the support engineer needs to help 5 different customers daily with their issues technically that may last 1 to 2 hours each (in a web session call or deep dive session), this chat (i.e. you may get between 1 to 3+ per day) will add another 30 min to 2 hours each on top of the already scheduled 5 customers (10+ hours). This will either push other important customers aside for the next day (lower customer satisfaction) or would make the support engineer work beyond normal working hours to fulfill the requirement. SAP is wondering why they are not getting high scores in Customer Satisfaction, it could be that the process they placed could be stressing their employees to be the best they could be. If you do this daily, you would have tired and highly stressed support engineers which will then be burned out. This may show up in our customer satisfaction results as your engineers are not fully rested and can only give 5 minutes to each new customers (i.e. ping pong effect). II) Second Task: You are also required to work nights and weekends (Saturday and Sunday). This is one of the hardest one that is given to any support engineer. Yes they may ask you to take some other days off or may even give you money but it also takes away the most important thing a person needs and that is time with family and time to recharge oneself. We can argue that the chat + weekend support makes an engineers life hard. Wait til you miss a call or work during the weekend, this is where you would feel what hell is like at work. These 2 tasks from product support is one of the most challenging thing to swallow (your mindset needs to be a zombie). If given the opportunity to work for another company or division in SAP that do not have these requirement, I would say sign me up immediately! Last issue is as soon as you get to a particular level, there is no more growth. You have maxed out. Your contained within your level per budget limitation. If you can work in SAP in another division, that is good. Within Product Support, it is tough.

Pros
I love it here. Coming from other companies, I have had a wide range of experience from an employee perspective, and SAP really does their best to treat their employees the best they can. Pros: 1. The work environment is wonderful. Collaboration, support, innovation: it's all there, and very prevalent 2. Mangers are excellent. They listen to your feedback, guide you for your career, and help set you up for success 3. The pay, benefits, vacation, etc. is all excellent
Cons
It's a big company. You own your career. It could be easy to get lost, but from my limited perspective so far, if you have the drive to succeed, SAP will help you get where you want to go

HR/IT ticket support departments need some work! I’ve had an HR ticket sitting open for 4 months with no response. IT responses to tickets can be too cryptic. This item alone is super frustrating when you need help and if you’re new to SAP. Remote Office: This is not really a Con but more of a challenge for those who haven’t been 100% remote before.

It recognizes that its Human Resources are its most powerful resource.

As a working mom, I have never felt unable to put my children first before work commitments.
","Change is a constant in the business work, particularly with tech. However, I have experienced more than average changes and re-orgs in my time at SAP. For example, I have had 4 different managers in one year as part of various re-orgs. My colleague has had 6 different managers in a year and a half. This leads to a feeling of job insecurity that is never good. Also, while SAP was ranked #1 for diversity by Forbes Magazine, my personal experience does not match that. There are no people of color on my team. Tangentially, I work with only one woman of color and three men of color. Older employees tend to get re-org'ed out. The Board is white and Germany with only one woman currently in what I would consider a 'more female"" role. To SAP's credit, they have stepped up in 2020 to address racial injustice in a meaningful way that has been more than lip service.

SAP has exceeded my expectations all around. SAP is enormous so navigating the ins and outs of an enterprise this large is reality; so yes, there will be cliques here and there, there will be managers who aren't as adept as other managers, and change is constant. Thing is, in 2020 successful companies have to keep inventing and innovating. If you stay stagnant in this global economy, you'll struggle. I'm listing this as a ""pro"" - there is no hand holding at SAP. The company has invested mightily when it comes to self-learning and if you take advantage of these options and invest in yourself - you'll be successful. There's plenty of opportunity for growth and movement within the org and not just from a professional standpoint. The company offers and supports sabbaticals and fellowships. The technology provided to employees is top-notch. Want to use a mac and not a PC? Sure! Need supplies now that we're all working from home? No problem, order what you need (in reason, obviously). There are many 2018 reviews stating how people were leaving certain SAP brands en masse - and while there is some validity there, many of them expressed regret 6/12/18 months later. Says a lot about the company.
Cons

","Some poor leadership - Current security leadership (August 2020) is pretty nonexistent, just does not communicate or lead in any way. They are not an obstacle to getting work done, but they do nothing to help get it done or provide direction in what should be done. Executive leadership changes - At this time (August 2020), recent Executive Board changes leave some uncertainty as to the direction of the company and the competence of the leadership. Need some more diverse and experienced members and need to communicate better. Organizational changes are frequent - Partially due to rapid acquisitions over the past decade, but organizational and leadership changes can be very frequent and by the time you adjust to one reorg, there is another. This creates a certain amount of administrative work that could otherwise be avoided.

","I was a member of the Successfactors support team. A job which is known throughout SAP to be a nightmare and high stress . There is a Top down management model where there is no thought as to how the decisions they make will impact the work force add. They are so focused on stats and spreadsheets they are disconnected for the common work force. I was there for a few years and every year the workers survey results had no faith in management, extremely high stress which resulted in burnout's. No progression at all through the position. There is a very high turn over rate because of the issues above They lack experience due to the fact that they do not want to promote their employees for the work they do and people eventually leave...these people (if replaced )are replaced but college graduates which starts the cycle. They come in, train up, get good at the job and are doing the job of a senior engineer and don't get paid fairly, get burned out due to stress and workload, they leave. They leave for a better opportunity, better pay, and better work conditions elsewhere....then the cycle starts again. So if you value being included in management decisions, the chance to progress within a role getting compensated fairly for the work you do, and having an acceptable level of stress in your day to day job.... Successfactors isn't for you. Also if you want a good sports and social Club.. avoid the galway office. You really get nothing out of it for the amount you pay in.

","There is no transparency at SAP and when there is no transparency there can’t be trust. Employees are treated as interchangeable parts and not as unique human beings.

Leadership survey process makes sure employees are taken care of and their needs are fullfilled. Performance based stock awards, medical benefits, time away from work, paternity and maternity leaves (almost 12 weeks plus) You are mostly rewarded based on performance and at times based on relationships
","If you are an U.S. employee and not a citizen, rely on visas to legally work, it's really difficult to grow here since lot of hiring managers do not want to deal with the administrative overhead of handling visas and the process, you will not be able to move within the company as freely as a citizen would. This limits your growth potential. If you want to gain global exposure or want to move to different country to continue your growth to avoid the constant anxiety around U.S. visa process, you have to deal with the global mobility bureacracies, COVID has made the already difficult international transfers impossible, it requires board level approval to move between countries, SAP touts the run simple mantra, there's one for running simple. If nobody but board could take decisions on an international transfer, you can understand how bureacratic the processes are here. Diversity - If you look up the L1, L2 and L3 leaders in SAP, you can figure out how much diversity is respected in senior leadership, it's only at individual contributor level and gender diversity at leadership level, you should start empowering people from different ethnic groups.

","You have to maintain relationships for promotions, it's not really based on performance, if someone you know rises to the top, they will take you with you. Most of the job positions are filled without any interview or screening, so you better focus on your networking skills than hard or smart working. During the COVID, they came up with strange restrictions which require approvals at all levels, for employees that want to move to another country due to visa restrictions, company process requires board approval, that's for less than 10,000 USD expense, talk about running simple. If you establish a process where nobody but board can take decisions for expenses of such low dollar value, you just don't have trust in your L3/L4/L5 leadership team, Global mobility team in SAP acts like government office (no offense to anyone), you have to constantly beg them to get your response. You will be constantly stifled by process bureacracies and following the chain of command blessings to get simple things done, everything is strictly hierarchical.

2020-07-08, Market Development,"Saint Louis Park, MN","Current Employee, more than 1 year",Walked the talk.... at first,"Entire organization is very interactive and (mostly) inclusive. I've never known a sales organization to have dedicated sales coaches and program managers specifically for market/sales/business development type roles, and that type of support goes a long ways. The highest achievers are team players and are always willing/able to share what's working well for them, both on a personal basis and on large group calls. Majority of management has done this role before, which you don't see too often. If they hadn't, they listen to their employees to understand exactly what we do, and go out of their way to constructively coach. Being backed by the SAP name is very powerful, but Concur still has its own culture. That feeling of independence goes a long way.
","There never seems to be an 'off' button, and it feels this way especially since COVID came around. I've never felt more stressed out to hit a number or micro-managed in my many, many years of sales. It's one thing to understand and adjust to what the business needs, but even when new objectives are communicated, there still seems to be a lack of alignment with our direct selling counterparts (a majority that I've met are outside hires that don't fully understand what Market Development's purpose within Concur is.) After working with past Concur employees and hearing what it used to be like, I feared that MD still honed the fraternity/ good ole boys club atmosphere. While it certainly appears to have improved, that aura still lingers above us and it can be felt on a daily basis. Management does everything they can to support 'under'performers, however many peers aren't as generous. I've seen a couple people leave because of that lack of camaraderie or inclusion. This job isn't easy by any means but these conditions make it a lot harder, and I can understand why there appears to be a faster revolving door here compared to other SaaS inside sales orgs.

SAP takes care of their employees (generally speaking) with the understanding that we will pay it back in kind. I, and others, have been very fortunate to always have opportunities at our doorstep. Technology and solution challenges are plenty, as there is always something to do. Christian Klein is brilliant... One could argue he became sole CEO too early, but those arguments would be severely flawed. He has a solid field of recognition and a strong grasp on what people in the company are doing. He's a financials wizard, but he keeps his heart very close to the technology. He's an absolute rock star in the making.
","Work/life balance can be an issue (particularly in nations without protective worker laws), and ancillary benefits are not always consistent from region to region. Some of this is to be expected. An unfortunate side effect of a large company, like SAP, is that that willfully ineffective people have an ability to hang around far longer than they should. They tend to hide in different departments or act as barriers to progress. Again, not a show stopper... but at times it can be an annoying impediment. Additionally, there is not enough visibility on the quality of individual (named) leaders. These individuals can either positively or (severely) negatively impact the quality, moral, and retention of great employees - thus, valuable talents depart (good leaders or good teammates under poor leaders) before it can be recognized. The one con that many of us have not yet learned to overcome is this: If you are NOT in proximity to the global headquarters, it is hard to get recognized and there is a bit of a glass ceiling on your upward mobility. There are fewer true growth opportunities. This means many people end up departing for other green fields in an effort to advance their careers and ambitions. SAP would do well to independently review their people surveys and outcomes for hidden talent in other regions.

2020-06-30, Sales Representative,"Dallas, TX","Former Employee, more than 3 years",Commission payments take 4-5 months!!,"Collaborative atmosphere among sales reps
","SAP pays commissions at the end of the month AFTER they receive payment from the customer. This is not the industry norm. A typical tech co pays reps at the end of the month following when the order was booked. (i.e. - close a deal in January, you get paid end of February.) At SAP, the rep gets paid only after the customer pays SAP. So in the case above, close a deal in January, customer pays in April, you get paid end of May. Most customers are paying @ net 90 the past couple of years. This means you'll wait 4-5 months on average to get your commission checks. And that's after long 12-18 month sales cycles that are the typical for SAP products. Be aware!!

Flexible hours: I can make adjustments to my schedule without any issues, as long as my colleagues are okay with it. In Product support, there are two different shifts - Day (morning and afternoon) and Late (afternoon and evening), increasing flexibility in this position.
","Organizational size - a few decisions that affect my job come top-down, from people that are very distant from my day to day work. It is very difficult to make decisions for a global organization, as each region will have their own set of variables. Home office: While it may be changing gradually, SAP still allows very limited WFH. Currently we are allowed 4-5 home office days per month. This refers to under normal circunstances. During the COVID-19 pandemic most people are working from home 100% of the time. Legacy technology: working with the SAP ERP system and ABAP can be frustrating to those who want to be on the cutting edge of tech, as these products tend to be slow to catch up with new resources.

","Senior leadership and depending on the team, direct managers doesn't really listen to you. They don't give any chances to try some processes improvements even though the whole team insists on it.

Also, support has a poor work/life balance. I need to work extra hours a lot of days to be able to handle all of our backlog. Not because I'm not productive, but because the backlog is huge and the direct management doesn't listen to our suggestions to improve it. The incoming is not under our control, but how we handle it is. And they seem to ignore this fact.

The other problem here is SAP is great at marketing itself - it is after all a sales and marketing machine and not a software company - so reality is very different from the illusion SAP markets itself as in terms of product or people diversity. If it was not for CoVID-19 a lot of people would have left sooner.

My onboarding process was well structured and had been developed specifically for my role with a mentor / buddy being assigned to support me for the first 3-4 months in my role. Really appreciating the flexibility that working for SAP brings - even before the COVID-19 situation developed I was given freedom to determine how I wanted to manage my role and working practices - it's absolutely the norm within the company. My role has been excited - yes, at times it feels like I'm drinking from the proverbial fire hydrant and trying to navigate a hugely complex organisation and my customers expect me to be an expert in everything...but the support from my team and colleagues elsewhere in the organisation has been great.
","The organisation is vast and very complex. Change appears to be the only constant, so definitely suiting people who are comfortable adapting to change. While there is a huge amount of resources available, they're not always easy to navigate and you really need to be able to quickly develop your own networks to help guide and support you. Lastly, while you're able to 'ramp up' into the role over a period of time, it very quickly becomes quite intense and can be easy to be all consuming - remember it's your role and you need to control the workload to the extent you're able to.

You need to be proactive to get great projects or see the potentials which are around you. SAP offers a lot to the employees, which helps the work life balance. I absolutely enjoyed the trust in work and the flexibility!
","Even if I mentioned the flexibility of the company, it depends on the manager you have. You can be absolutely inflexible and feel unconfident if you are in the wrong team with the wrong manager. --> If you feel unhappy you need to be proactive and sometimes a concern is slow.. it can take a year until you find another internal possibility. Internal processes which are complex can make you feel unvalued and you do not see the outcome of your work in the product. Everything feels slow.

2020-05-25, IT,,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",Poor workforce management - too many cooks spoil the broth!,"1. Very stable company financially - unlike most startups and smaller IT companies, SAP has been profitable for decades - this translates to 'no financial pinch' for employees. 2. Highly unlikely for SAP employees to be laid off or furloughed due to Covid-19 or any other crisis. 3. Highly unlikely to be fired for non-performance or poor performance. But like any major company, they will do a major reorg every 5 years and at that time, even good performers will loose their job.
","1.Risky proposition for H1B holders and Green card aspirants- they will say they will process, but it will not go all the way to the end. Even SAP employees in senior roles with 10+ years in the company have had to exit USA due to visa issues. 2.Like in the case with many European companies, the important/exiting/value adding work is done in their European HQ (Germany for SAP). So, folks in USA, India etc are only given tasks that they don't really care about, as it is not important. 3.SAP has a large workforce, but leadership is lacking and is poorly managed as the ratio between leaders and 'worker-bees' is bad. For eg, if a Sr. person in leadership role is good, he/she will have 50 or more direct reports and responsibility to manage 2-3 acquired companies for that department. So, due to this overburden, he/she will not be able to perform upto his ability. In other words, 'good guys' cannot perform due to over-burden and 'bad guys' cannot perform, as don't have the skills and experience.

2020-04-29, Software Engineer,"Washington, DC","Current Employee, more than 3 years","Great Company, messed up what they did to Jen Morgan","Great benefits and work life balance. I love the focus on diversity and inclusion in the company. Truly felt like a global company, until the board ousted Jen Morgan. The stock program, OwnSAP, is a great value for employees. You can contribute up to 10% of each paycheck to the program and SAP will match 40% of what you contribute (up to some ceiling). The stock immediately vests, so if even you don't want to invest in SAP you can immediately sell it and essentially increase your salary by 4% for free.
","Booted Jen Morgan in favor of a German CEO. Feels hypocritical to tout diversity and inclusion as a key value in SAP, then find an excuse to push out one of the most qualified businesswoman in the world. If the board didn't want co-CEOs, then why did they agree to it in the first place? Massive loss to SAP.

","The process is well-defined, but things happen slow. The meetings are a lot. This makes coding time less. Most of the things are already done, there is a lot of legacy.

Pros
- company culture is good, embracing and welcoming - my team was really welcoming, enjoyed the time with them - processes and tools were quite good, there were opportunities to initiate change - I was able to do things in a way I wanted, which is not everywhere - office environment was also OK, however get prepared that some teams have the privilage to have their own separated office within the building, but some need to stick with different deparments under the same open office environment, which can be annoying - opportunity to buy lunch for a reasonable price within the bulding
Cons
- salary is lower than the market - rigid and not welcoming to new ways of employments - they rather have the team understaffed than to have a good performer in remote or to find any other ways - home office policiy is outdated, understood and executed differently depending on the team you are in - reaction and progression can be sometimes slow, depending on who has interest in the initiative - sometimes stuck within job titles and being pushed to consider “someone who knows someone from upper management” for a role - as the company claims to be an equal opportunity employer and embracing diversity and being open minded, this was hard to take - sometimes a bit too cost reduction focused company - hiring more lower level positions with lower salaries etc My end supposed to be usual and normal, but due to the covid situation I had challenges, especially that the company seemed to be rigid, not flexible and understanding at all, still pushing for the same exit procedure which was impossible to carry out...

Care for life is another great initiative at SAP India. I'm thankful that I was able to see culture at SAP, one of the best.
","Since the product is acquired form Quinnox, the work culture is still the same since 5years. Learning curve is zero, good place to settle down though. Feels like it is completely deviated from SAP, not much of employee engagment activities nor a better team outing. Budget is never utilized as per the needs of employees and it is always management's decision for outings/Team bonding activies. If you resign from your role don't expect a baseline bonus also, you will get less than what is mentioned on ur offer letter. Your previous year effort is as good as a dustbin. Too much of concentration on the process, in turn, the quality of effort goes down. Perfection in existing things is zero, always focused on new tasks. Not at all a good place for long term stay if you want to improve your skills.

Pros
Great company, great experience, good work-life balance but still depends of the projects.
Cons
Very low salary and benefits, not competitive to the market at all. Speaking with managers about promotion even with excellent feedback from the projects, it's only political speaking with nothing concrete. You can give 150% from you to the company but SAP Portugal will never award your efforts and passion making SAP great company. It's really disappointed that you are only a resource for cash and nothing more in near shore centre. I know from friends and colleagues other SAP location are completely different how they value the employees.

HR is chaotic and, is not even available to receive a feedback. After I pointed out some negative aspects about my project, I started to be criticized for everything.

","Low salaries compared to other shared service centres in prague. No opportunity to be promoted to a senior position, it is only possible to go from current position to management. Recent management position was not opened to everyone, position was filled by another manager and that position filled by a member of that existing team. total lack of transparency. As there are no senior position this creates a lack of motivation amongst colleagues as you can be very average in current position as there is no reason to improve as there is nothing to aim for. As management is very laid back and hands off aproach, team members can be lazy and nothing is really resolved. High turnover, low salary being one of the reasons, management do not seem to care that is frustrating to train new team members over and over again for them to leave within months. You can ask for more work but there are no benefits to doing this as there is no promotion or salary increase. no point in doing extra work and earning same as person that does the very basiscs.

Bad management, they're employing more people than needed and not having enough projects to assign them on. They always promise upgrading to a new level and set out targets but at the review they somehow forget about the upgrade even though the targets have been met.

They depend heavily on the same install base to keep buying bc they are so tied into SAP that they can't leave. You'll never beat SFDC in a head to head deal unless it's an SAP shop. Only way you'll make your numbers is on named accounts. SAP says they want to goto mid sized accounts, but has zero name recognition puts very little effort to make those customers feel special.

If that is not an option for you, try to get into SAP Concur, Qualtrics or SuccessFactors, they seem to have more dynamic cultures.
","While SAP's mission and marketing used to sound great, speaking for myself, its culture with regards to early talent, women (yes still) and people who are different (other than autism) is not my flavor. Please note this can all be very different in each location. Top-down-innovation approach. When you look at LinkedIn insights, you will notice that they have not grown in employees over the last years. They keep telling it is hard to find talent. I think that the problem is fostering talent when there are many managers instead of leaders, even at the very top.

Stock purchase plan, commuter reimbursement, lunch at one of the offices and daily snacks at the other, social events, weekly on-site yoga classes. There's flexibility in terms of working remotely, and work life balance is prioritized. If you're just getting started in your career there are lots of intern opportunities, as well as an intern community with their own events. Diversity is embraced. The male to female ratio is off, but that's typical in tech ... however, there's the Business Women's Network that both women and men are encouraged to participate in. As for the work itself, there are teams working on a range of different products. Also, change is pretty much the norm and there's always something new to learn.
","SAP's head office is in Germany, and that's where the majority of the leadership opportunities reside, at least for my line of work (user assistance development, aka technical writing). So if you're ambitious, you may find after a while that you can only go so far at SAP in Montreal.

If you work here and you see it you know it's true they all do off source labors and contracting work that's it. The salary is great, yeah for full time workers. And guess what, you don't even stand a chance for full time even if you are an internal application. Disrespect is everywhere from management. Ready to yell at you for mistakes and never an appreciation. People are so petty they even find problems to report you for using phones and act like they are special. Oh and nobody holds doors for you with a smile ever here. They do it like it's a task and they are scared of socialization. Elevator talk? Forget it. A good morning from stranger? Forget it. Free food? You are ready to pay for pasta and sauce with no meatball? Meatball is extra charge! Oh and the lines re infinite and you basically fight for tables.

","What I do not and will not appreciate it for, is the piece of trash that came out of their idea. As a developer, you better feel suicidal if you think about starting working with the biggest disaster of a programming language. The language is locked down on their own kernel, so you can only do what they want you to do. Further more, the libraries of functions they put at your disposal may work, under some conditions, but you will never know that because they are not documented, anywhere. The only documentation you will find are the indians on forums. It's a straight up joke. Some of the mostly used functions are not even working properly, risking to end up spending a day or two finding an alternative. SAP is aware of their ""amazing"" work, that's why they are pushing their Cloud agenda so hard at every opportunity. They want everybody to ditch ABAP for ever and rely on other programming languages made by people who know what they are doing. Pathetic.

SAP HR has a history of not supporting women who are facing harassment in the workplace.

Unless you escalate it, those accused of harassment will face little penalty while those who experienced it are made to feel guilty for even reporting it.

","Your experience at SAP will depend entirely on the department that you have joined. If you have joined SAP Labs, you can even retire from there. Most folks in SAP Labs have been there for 20+ years. It's very safe for techies, although SAP has unable to develop in house even 1 futuristic product over 35 years. Shocking! If you have joined SAP in the Business side (Sales/Marketing/Customer Facing roles), then there's a good chance you won't last for 20 months unless: 1. You have a god father in the company 2. You have joined as a management trainee If you join as a lateral recruit in the sales & marketing side, from other organizations, without knowing anyone powerful inside, then God help you. All the plum roles have already been grabbed internally by the old timers. The newly created experimental roles (whose life depends on whether the business did well or not), & the junior most roles are what is published for externals. So be very cautious before taking up a SAP offer. If you think you will rise purely on merit, you would be extremely disappointed. Finally, 90% + people in the Business teams don't earn much incentives. So you will rarely be earning your annual CTC.

2019-10-30, Senior Director,"Vancouver, BC","Current Employee, more than 10 years","Great People, Great Opportunities, Great Benefits","I've worked at SAP for many years and I'm continually impressed with how helpful employees are to each other. It drives me to make an extra effort so that anyone who comes to me leaves feeling that I removed a big unknown or roadblock for them. I believe these small behaviours add up to a great performance from the whole organization. After years at SAP, the one thing that has kept me is the ability to work on what I want. There are so many industries and technologies that SAP covers that you can start in a new technology area or run a large team or even have your new idea turned into a business. Finally, the benefits are very good - salary, bonuses, lunch card but more importantly I find for some are nice extras are the health benefits and support services like counseling to career path support and even resume writing. Also, I would like to add that working from home has been hugely helpful as I start a family as I can manage my life and work schedule together.
","I believe it's hard to say there is a con with SAP, or if there is, they will likely solve it. It's more like, one is looking for red and SAP only has blue, or blue, green, orange, black. So a con might be that SAP doesn't fit what one is looking for right now. Do some research and learn what SAP can offer you. SAP is a large company with many offices. If you want to work in a small social networking startup and like the challenge of fighting it out to overcome all odds for a big win (or big loss) then maybe SAP isn't for you. With that said, if you want to experiment in a safer environment, with strong support services, access to customers and access to experienced people then SAP could work for you.

2019-10-16,Anonymous,Singapore,Current Employee,An eye opening experience!,"Work-life balance is encouraged. Employees seem to be treated well, respected and everyone has a voice. They are also expected to take control of their own careers. No hand-holding here unless absolutely necessary. The ability to work from home is amazing and this notion seems to constant throughout the company. Compensation seems to be fair. Most people seem very nice, this seems to be a constant at all levels from junior, experience, senior and management staff. There is a certain level of warmth and friendliness through the company. This is encouraging as there seems to be a high level of collaboration, non-combative behaviour and generally, there is a an emphasis being team players and always aiming for a win-win scenario in everything. The office and work environment are nice, with good facilities, recreational areas and well-equipped desk although I'm not personally a fan of the open office concept but I understand it is simply how the office is arranged. Generally and broadly speaking, everyone I've encountered seems to be incredibly skilled at their jobs. This is a positive thing as this hopefully means that there is plenty of room of competent people and little room for freeloaders or incompetent people. Work is fun and challenging (for me at least). The culture is fantastic so far. The reviews, comments, and opinions of SAP as a company has indeed been very true. It is indeed a great place to work.
","The company is huge with numerous departments. Navigating around every aspect is incredibly intimidating and potentially difficult to understand easily. There is a huge learning curve in understanding the core concept of the company (SAP is broadly a software company but it's also so much more) and there are many, almost too numerous products to understand. The ability to take charge of one's own career is both a pro and a con as new hires can get lost without guidance from their managers.

2019-10-15, Software Developer,"Vancouver, BC","Current Employee, more than 1 year",Awesome Place to Work,"- The company's long-term prospects are looking great. Vancouver location especially has lots of opportunity, because it's home to development on SAP's most successful ""homemade"" (non-acquisition) cloud product (SAP Analytics Cloud). The product is also a part of the core strategy now. - Very respectful, healthy place to work at. The company has really good values, result being that everyone is professional, respectful and nice to each other. - Lots of really smart people to work with and learn from. - There's lots of really challenging, interesting work to go around. Lots of movement towards newer technologies as well. There will be no shortage of demand for development work, or opportunities to challenge yourself if that's what you want to do. - Good work-life balance is promoted. Devs aren't on-call all the time. No expectation to be constantly crunching, unlike other places. - High performers are recognized and rewarded. Lots of opportunity for advancement. - People with ideas and opinions on how things can improve are encouraged to share, especially if you're willing to be part of the solution.
","- SAP is in the ""A-tier"" of compensation, but not ""S-tier"". There are a few other companies in Vancouver that pay the top of the top (about 2.5x the average), whereas SAP is in the level below that (2x the average). The kind of talent at SAP is about the same, so you do take a pay cut in exchange for better work-life balance. This also causes issues with losing some really good talent to competitors. - Culture changes as product in Vancouver Labs starts to mature. Less startup-like perks, less free-flow spending on miscellaneous things like free food, events, etc. - Technology challenges such as old frameworks that can be difficult to work with (SAP UI5), technical debt, etc. Still lots of work left to overcome these challenges, all the while needing to balance the need for aggressive product growth.

","Not always simple to navigate, which I suppose is the nature of a very large, international company. But doesn't always run simple. Many processes and long periods to get things done. Channels and sales could enjoy better collaboration (which is undoubtedly the same for all organisations). Not as relaxed in terms of dress code in my view as it could be; still quite formal and 'office style' especially for women. As other companies like Google and start up businesses relax their style maybe SAP could try that too.

","- Terrible compensation at SAP silicon valley/bay area. Even though I have always been a top performer in my team (I've been SAP Catalyst for several times), even with my promotions/progressions I have stayed at 70% of my level's median salary. Raises have been around 3-4%. My only option (I'm bound to SAP through my Visa and slow GC processing) was to switch to a company SAP acquired, which I did. Suddenly, it was the most normal thing in the world to be paid 100% of my level's median salary. - Slow Green Card processing - I'm not affected by this, but many of my peer complain about it. SAP uses Fragomen for Visa processing and they are terribly slow. Expect for a single email to answered by Fragomen after 4 weeks, sometimes two months. Now figure how many years some people wait to just get their GC process started. - Incompetent people & product management - Most managers have no idea how cloud software is built and how dev teams have to be organized. - Reporting lines across the ocean and back - Terrible product quality: I do not know a single SAP product that I enjoy using. Everything is just hacked together. - In the very end, no real value-creating work: Software development at SAP is mainly about stitching together acquisitions with our core. All the newer stuff (machine learning, IoT blockchain, etc.) is done at comparatively low investment (politically and with resources) mostly driven by non-technical people instead of ""value engineering"". - I haven't seen a single ""innovation"" project succeed at SAP within the past 5 years (Leonardo, etc.). Everything is just stitched together somehow with no real strategy.

ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT: SAP is big, but everyone I talk to agrees the thing we love is the way you can mold your role/job and career here - and if you decide you want to leave to try something different or you're taking a break from work to take care of family, and want to come back to SAP you'll find that additional experience viewed as a positive (and in the case of a break to care for children/family, you will find support for your re-entry). That said, if you are someone who wants a job that's highly-directed (strong oversight, active management by your boss on a day to day basis with daily feedback/input) this is not going to be a place for you in most cases. This is a highly-independent work environment in the vast majority of cases. CULTURE: I'm going to sound marketing-y for a minute, but imagine working for a company that is EDGE Certified (leading business certification for gender equality), has a global Tech Diversity & Inclusion team, has offices and customers in ~180 countries; has a major Corporate Social Responsibility organization that coordinates volunteers for service activities, and during 2 mos of the year offers paid time off to participate in volunteer activities; and donation-matching is offered. SAP has been in industry leader since 2014 delivering an Annual ""Integrated Report"" which considers the corporate impact on the environment and our sustainability, to use a holistic view of our total impact beyond finances as our measure of success each year. We also have a range of employee interest groups including Business Women's Network, Black Employees Network, and are one of Workplace Pride's Top 10 companies in the world for LGBTQ-friendly workplace environment and policies. Inter-cultural training is provided to help teams in different countries understand how to work and communicate more effectively with each other. This is not about political correctness; it's about being respectful of others' cultures and different points of view, even if you have different beliefs. GLOBAL REACH/IMPACT: If you eat it, drink it, drive it, wear it, or use it in your daily life, our customers probably make it. E.g., 78% of the world's food supply is delivered by SAP customers (including 82% of the world's chocolate supply, and 72% of the world's beer). That is incredible - but it also is a key reason our Board and CEO have a mission to ""Help the world run better and improve people's lives"". If your company touches 70% of financial transactions that happen daily, globally, you have an opportunity and a responsibility to think about how that reach can benefit people - not just ourselves. A lot of people struggle wanting to work somewhere that makes a difference - I've found working at SAP I have a long-term career where I do make a difference, in ways that I can't imagine other companies could. Very cool. SUPPORT TO INNOVATE & TAKE RISKS: the CEO says ""tell it like it is"" and take informed risks and as far as I've seen, this is supported (standard caveat of, ""when it's done in a constructive, and respectful way"". This may partly be a function of German work culture, but I've found the openness here refreshing compared with friends' experiences. PURPOSE-DRIVEN: SAP's mission FOR YEARS is ""Help the world run better and improve people's lives"". This was our mission before it was 'cool'. This was our mission before terms like 'green-washing' and 'virtue-signaling' came into mainstream conversations. We have had CSR programs for more than 20 years; we have had sustainability programs for at least a decade; we've had excellent benefits like paid parental leave for adoptions, paid bereavement leave (immediate family ), affordable healthcare, paid vacation starting at 3 wks (sick days are separate from vacation days), subsidized public transportation, and our larger offices there are employee cafeterias where you can get subsidized lunches (hot food, not just deli-style food), sourced locally when possible, and with vegetarian and vegan options. TRAINING & CAREER SUPPORT: a robust program for growing within the company means once you join SAP, you can do a wide range of jobs and change careers - as I did - multiple times without leaving the company. I personally attribute this to the German business model, which brings in young talent and nurtures it, versus the typical American model where recruiters look for existing-employed individuals and attempt to hire them away. This model means a lot of people stay at SAP for a long time compared to other tech companies - but the ability to move around within the company and try different jobs keeps your career fresh and interesting. There are formal and informal job training programs, formal Mentoring and Coaching programs, internal recruiters to help people move around, and - one of the best things - opportunities to work in other countries for short term or permanent assignments, with the most opportunities in Asia, Europe, and Latin America.
","LARGE BUSINESS COMPLEXITY: the entrepreneurial spirit is real, but SAP still is a large enterprise, with a broad portfolio of software and there's just a layer (or layers) of complexity that's unavoidable. Approvals are layered and things don't move as fast as you want/should. No worse than other places, better than many. RE-ORGs: all companies in tech go through reorganizations more frequently than companies in traditional fields like manufacturing, but SAP is somewhat known for moving teams and organizations around faster than average. Depending on your role in the company, you could have a new focus in your job every year without actually moving to a new team. If you hate change and having to constantly learn new things, this will be challenging for you. But if you get bored easily, this could be a positive even if it can be frustrating.

","1. SAP varies the benefits it offers its employees based on geography. Employees in the US, for example, get significantly less paid parental leave than those in Europe. Ex. In Europe, the *minimum* a new mother can take is 15 weeks, and she can take up to 26. In the US, the *maximum* is 12 weeks. For a company that talks a lot about taking care of its employees, it seems somewhat hypocritical to treat them all differently, working within the minimum guidelines laid down by law. 2. Internal raises and salary increases are fairly stagnant. Practically the only way to get a significant raise within SAP is to get a new job in a different department. This is awful, because then those with much higher expertise and product knowledge just... leave. Regular actual raises for increased expertise and product knowledge would save SAP a fortune in hiring and training newbies, as well as improve employee morale and help retain good workers.

Flexible working locations - I do 100% remote work, but there are offices that I can go to when I need some people energy. Access to any SAP offices worldwide. Flexible working hours - many people work 4 days a week or on alternative working time. This can be arranged depending on the nature of your work and your team. Investment on people - SAP invests A LOT on people's wellbeing and growth. The company culture supports helping each other as well. I've been benefiting from shadowing and mentoring of amazing people around the world. Good benefits, free lunch and free gym.

Before I joined the “real” SAP, I’ve doing & using SAP R3/4 for 15+ years, however only now I know more about SAP, the culture, wow, and a lot more. 1. Buddy program- you always have some colleague assigned to help you and support you wherever and whenever; 2. You clearly feel you are welcomed and loved by your team ; 3. Your work life balance is one of the KPI of your boss; 4. Ask questions, don’t be afraid and you always get answers; 5. Numerous tools and methodology far far beyond imagination, like jumping into ocean of knowledge; 6. You are always spoiled by HR with so many activities, parties, warm emails, ballots; 7. Maternity and parental leave for sure; 8. You get birthday greetings from global CEO! 9. A true diversity environment, just be yourself; 10. Same in any SAP offices I’ve been traveled to.

Pros
There are really very good benefits, such as gym (with a trainer that prepares a plan) company car, many different learning opportunities, online, webinars, etc. There's mentoring and coaching and a series of events for all kind of personal interest (from family related, culture related, technology related) it's a really good atmosphere where all internal communication is informal. We have several options to change path internally and work in different areas according to one's interest.And we always come across international colleagues that make our dily work more enriching. The best thing is the cantine, food for fee at lunch with 3 or more options for menu, salad buffet, and dessert. Free coffee and tea and YEAH! the option to work remotely.
Cons
A big big company is very difficult to coordinate and the amount of bureaucracy in some processes is overwhelming. Get teams from different areas to work together is complicated. Despite the many many options to change to different works and areas, grow a career is very difficult. After some years there's a stagnation, specially for women.

I've been working in Galway in a global communications role for just over a year and I've had such a great experience so far! Since my first interview I've just really loved the culture and people at SAP. There are a lot of benefits to working here including - Management puts trust in the employees - Autonomy and a lot of opportunities to take initiative and make an impact - Great culture and company values that you can get behind - Opportunity to volunteer and help out your local community - Flexible working hours - Option to work remotely up to 2 days a week - Gym onsite and free lunches is a real bonus - They value employee development and there are lots of learning and development opportunities for every level.

","Salary is poor compared to our competitors. Legacy issue at SAP, has always been the case, and nothing seems like this will change any time soon. Management seems like they're doing what they can with resources they have, however don't expect frequent events throughout the year, or much in the way of making employees feel valued. Seems to be running on a shoestring budget. Ireland is low-cost center compared to other countries, and it certainly feels that way. Compensation for increased workload / skill is minimal. Don't expect big year on year increases, regardless of the work you do. Long term strategy and goals are defined, but do not feel achievable for the most part. Targets set by board / upper management feel unrealistic, and overly ambitious. Decisions made by upper management often are confusing and contradictory. Told to work efficiently and push for the strategy, but all the hard work in the world won't help meet targets. The salesperson attitude of pushing services / upgrades on customers is prevalent, but disheartening. Some managers have been in the role for many years, very stuck in their ways and closed off to criticism and suggestions Company wants to hire and promote innovative thinkers, but new ideas are often ignored due to costs or lack of medium / long term commitment Training is poor to non-existent. Again management cites costs in refusing to provide proper training to employees. Management wants skilled, motivated, innovative workforce, while not wanting to pay for it

Pros
Working at SAP is an adventure where I am always being challenged to do my best. It is a place where you can grow, learn, and better yourself in a truly supportive environment. It is both a large global corporation where you can travel and develop friendships all across the world, and at the same a close knit group of people where you never feel you are just a number or unappreciated for the work you do.
Cons
The only downsides to working at SAP are those that are part of every large corporation. It seems that you are constantly in meetings and there is always some new buzzword or management practice that results in a reorganisation of your team. Not really a negative thing though, as it means you are always meeting new people and taking training that you can apply to all areas of your life. It gives you a chance to grow and take the opportunity for advancement or change of career path within the company.

Nice product (Cloud), good infrastructure (MacBook, iPhone), good salary and benefits, friendly manager.
Cons
High pressure, hard work with unexperienced sales in combination with a product, which don't fit in the customer segment very well. What is missing is a clear strategy from management, so everybody do something, but seems not coordinated very well. Onboarding don't exist, learning at the job. Culture is special, so you might talk about improvements, but criticism is not desired. So as a Presales you are more a demo guy, not real strategic cowork with sales, you must check yourself requirements, etc. It must be clear, that first come sales, then after a long way after presales. In general company works primary via relationships and you should work in HQ.

However, you cannot work from home neither Fridays nor Mondays. - When you work on a Saturday or Sunday, you get 1,5days in exchange (instead of 1 day as other companies do). You get 2 days in exchange when you work a bank holiday. - The pension plan is really good in comparison with other companies. If you put 4% of your salary and the company adds a 10%. Other companies only match what you put. - You can create a development plan and get advice from HR. I have seen people moving to other departments but have also seen people trying hard and didn´t succeed. It all depends how helpful your manager is. When a person in my team tried to move to another department, his current manager said to the future manager, “we need him here. We cannot afford losing him from our team”. This person eventually left the company. - You can charge your electric car (if you have one) for free.
","- Several People in the team have suffered burnouts. Since January this year SAP is not replacing people who left the team. This means than the ones staying have double of work and end up suffering burnouts. - The salaries are completely unfair. People who began years ago were offered less salary than the ones beginning nowadays. Despite all the salaries reviews done every March, some salaries are still far away from being at the same level. There are cases with €3000 of difference between the new and old people. The best is that you cannot talk about these differences with your manager because it is written in the contact that you cannot say your salary to anybody. If you try to point out this difference, they will try to force you to say the name of the person and this employee will get in trouble. - The salary increases really little. Sometimes the salary increase is €450 gross a year! - You always have to queue to go to the toilet in the main building. There are really few toilets for the number of people working there. - The main building is an eco-friendly building. This mean that sometimes is warm and sometimes is cold. I still remember when everybody was sent home during the irish heat wave last year. There were only 30ºC outside but we all felt like chicken being roasted inside an oven in the main building.

","There is a real lack of strong management. There are some great managers at SAP but over the years I've also seen really bad managers progress who have no respect from their employees. This can be frustrating. I think the people survey is often done and then overlooked and managers are not invested in to ensure they are the right person for the job. I also feel that we need to think about the customer more. Over the past few years we have really lost our way with customer empathy and make demands on customers that really shouldn't be made. We need to stop running before we can walk.

Pros
Benefits (Company car, free food, etc.). Mobile working. Flexible working hours. A lot of friendly colleagues and nice offices. A lot of knowledgeable colleagues.
Cons
Old people with an on-premise mindset are driving the company. It is very difficult to get promoted at SAP. The rules for getting a promotion are not clear. Even if one takes an initiative and applies and gets an internal job with a higher career level, HR and management will find a way to prevent the candidate from getting a promotion. Salaries for experienced talents that have been for a long time at SAP are at least 20 - 30% less than their real market values. New hires are not always the best fit for the company. Development work is mostly offshored to cheaper countries which affects the software quality delivered. Cloud business models for most of the products do not match today's market prices and expectations. Internal processes within the company need optimization Too many organizational heirarchy levels. Reorgs are constantly disrupting work. No true / real innovations that have been brought to the market since a very long time.

Pros
Some stability and benefits, such as defined contribution plan, recently created Sick leaves and parental leaves
Cons
Management too much obsessed by their team productivity stats, and their own career and benefits, no much acknowledgement of team members efforts and success. Managers don’t encourage any career evolution, don’t provide any valuable training to their team members, request team members to download their own reference PDF guides from online learning portals instead of promoting actual trainings. Taking training is actually discouraged as only 5 days a year are allowed for “personal development” and taking more time than those 5 days is considered as non productive, and decreases the productivity ratio of the contributor and the team. Productivity target is set to 90.5% for consulting teams.

Very poor management overall. Pittsburgh management was asking employees to lie to potential clients by their work experience. No on boarding of new hires so they can exhibit SAP methodologies. Training is very poor. It's e-learning (on your own tim. e), which is a joke. We were required to make up extra work when taking full time training courses. We had a manager from India, who had zero talent espousing SAP's culture and values. Employees at Big 4 consulting companies train their employees better.

","- Firing during the probation period - The managers don't disclose the actual reason why they are firing an employee during the probation period: they are silent almost all the time during the whole 2 months and 1/2 of employment and then - towards the end of the probation period - they come up to the employee, stating that he/she failed to reach the targets during his/her employment and they aren't sure whether they want to confirm him/her as a permanent employee, blaming it all on the employee and on his /her performance, although the employee is trying his / her best to accomplish his/her goals: a few days later , the managers fire the employee on the spot. - As a matter of fact, there are some other reasons behind a firing during the probation period: in my case, for instance, the manager noticed (after more or less 1 month of employment) that one of the team members (who had been in the company for more than 10 years) and who was supposed to take care of my whole training really disliked me and was very often mad at me, although I was trying as hard as I could to abide by their rules and to follow the trainings. - The reason why this person disliked me so much was actually related - in my opinion - to my unusual skills to speak several languages (indeed I ended up - quite by chance - in a project where all of the languages which I've been studying in the past 10 years were spoken, so this colleague was clearly envying me and was behaving exactly this way (complaining about me with the manager, stating that I wasn't paying enough attention to the trainings etc) - To assume that someone is unfit for an entry level position (I had colleagues, whose job experience at SAP was their very first one, indeed they were part-time employees, studying at the university) sounds quite suspicious, considering that I had worked for 2 years previously in similar customer service positions in other companies and I never really had issues with the work itself: it's the kind of job which can be done basically by anyone, who has basic IT skills and basic language skills. - The job itself consisted in calling the customers in order to remind them to pay for their invoices: a few days before firing me, the manager was trying to convince me that I had some mental disorder or cognitive deficit, keeping me from performing the job, which was actually an extremely easy job. - The manager said also - though - that he believed in my potential and would have helped me find another position in the same company: I applied for about 25- 30 internal positions after getting fired, but none of my applications was successful though, so I spent 3 months unemployed and short of money, before receiving another job offer from another company. - Obviously the manager told the other team members to behave exactly like the colleague who was bullying me all the time: they all wanted to make me believe that I - as a matter of fact - was unfit for the job and really deserved to get fired. - During my first month of employment - indeed - only this colleague seemed to have something against me but, after some time, all of the employees (who were the manager's accomplices ) who at the very beginning used to have a friendly or neutral behavior towards me started being very strict on me , being very picky about every single (real or assumed) mistake from my side. - After spending a few years in some multinational corporations, I actually realized that - every time the managers notice there's a conflict between two employees in the same project, they usually don't bother explaining the most arrogant and senior colleague that maybe he/she's wrong to have a certain behavior towards a new joiner (they find it awkward, how can you contradict some senior colleague, who has been in the company for such a long time?), they'd rather make these 2 colleagues work in 2 different projects or - the way it happened to me, to fire one of the two employees (usually the new joiner), so that they won't have any chance to meet and work together again. - Most of the times - though - it's not that easy for an employee to find another suitable position in the same company , because the entry level positions aren't open all the time and most of the times only the senior positions are open and some employees might not fulfill the requirements for such positions. - To sum it all up: the manager(s) wanted to hire me and they chose me among other candidates: however, after realizing - 20/30 days after my starting date, that one of the senior colleagues really hated me, the manager asked the other team members (who really had nothing against me) to be as critical and strict on me as this senior colleague was, to make this person's behavior look like ""normal"" and shared by the other ones, in order for the manager to be able eventually to fire me for a pretextual reason.

Pros
I work for Ariba Consulting Team in UK and their are lot of pro: - You meet lot of smart people in the company and some of them are quite driven - Consulting team support each other except for people who are close to UK management, they only scratch the back of UK management team and don't carry about rest. - The product is being upgraded, although bit slowly according to me but going in right direction. - Regional (EMEA) Management is quite good and willing to listen, they are very helpful and provide full support. The EMEA management want to get things right and are willing to make investment /commitment to make things happen. - Opportunity to work with number of different clients with unique business requirements.
Cons
I guess the con is that UK Management Team - will not support you if you are not in their good books irrespective of valid business rational. - you need to be a female to grow within the EMEA team - you may be given opportunities, if you become 'yes man' or women. Basically, you will not have to apply your mind in front of UK Management and accept their wrong decision making as your fault. - allowed to be micro managed and sometime to the extent that one has to do the things in the same manner or sequence as they do although their is no other reason. - you will have to go through a tick box exercise and actual work, concerns, issues or challenges are not even discussed. - UK team have made Ariba UK consulting team as personal fiefdom. I don't think they fully embrace the SAP practices in fully and implement things around edges.

Pros
- Projects: possibility to work on great multinational and multicultural projects with the whole SAP structure behind you to ensure you succeed - Benefits: Good benefits package, especially if you're a senior - Other perks: you can see the doctor at the office and there's free fruit and coffee every day
Cons
- Facilities: lack of office space and parking spots, as the company is growing - Talent retention: there is no retention policy in Human Resources, which causes consultants with valuable skills to be hired by the competition - Work life balance: While management is generally OK with it, there is no policy on working remotely and the burden is on the consultant to always ask and explain him/herself about it - Teams are too large for a manager to manage effectively, making communication and companionship within the team very difficult - Managers: Managers don't work with you on the projects, they are simply managing each team's project staffing. This opens the door to subjective performance reviews, as the managers don't see themselves the work that you produced, relying instead on third party accounts of your performance.

2019-06-12, Software Developer,"Palo Alto, CA","Former Employee, more than 3 years",The cheapest company in the bay,"- You can chill a lot and coast along. Variable comp parts are very minimal and firings are pretty uncommon, despite bad performance. TLDR: Perfect company for coasting and retirement. - Perks are OK (but not great)
","Working for SAP, especially if you are the Bay Area and you want to have a career with a meaningful purpose or comp is one of the worst life choices you can make. There's a ton of problems at SAP, but I believe many of them are symptoms of an extremely below market compensation and incentive structure which nurtures and rewards a culture of mediocrity. They key problem areas are: Compensation (Note this is from the perspective of Engineering): - The compensation at SAP Palo Alto is severely below market. New Grads often get only around ~100k TC (total incl, bonus and stock!) and even as a seasoned engineer and high performer it is extremely difficult to get 200k total comp. Most folks I know earn between 100-150k (again incl. bonus and stocks) and have around 5YoE and are usually pretty high performing. While ""100-150k"" sounds like a lot somewhere else this is ridiculously bad for a company of SAP's size in the bay area when you are a high performer. Almost every startup, no matter how small will pay you more Base than what SAP offers as Total Comp and give you a generous stock option package on top. Most bigger companies of SAP's size will pay you at least 1.5x, often times 2x than SAP (FANG would go even 2.5x-3x if you get lucky) . Furthermore the salary progression is very slow. If you progress as a high performer you get often times only between 2-4% salary increase per year. During a promotion you will normally get at max only get 10/11% more, often times less than that. Note typically you can get a promotion earliest every 2 years. On top of that almost everyone with your YoE gets paid the same, no matter how good or bad you're performing. I.e. If you perform 10x to the worst person in your team, you're probably still just earning about the same, max 10% more. Managers get a very small bonus and salary raise pool that they have to distribute between folks. Furthermore the pool size doesn't depend on the performance of the team. If you are in a team with only high performers the pool size is the like in teams with only low performers. Altogether the comp level is extremely low and the system does not reward performance, therefore everybody is just coasting and the whole atmosphere is very demoralizing. Extremely political and bad decision making: Most of the middle management is extremely political and just trying to keep their job / justify their existence and increase their teams headcount instead of actually making the right technology and product decisions in the interest of the company. I had one SVP even admitting this to me and saying that at ""SAP SVPs are like dukes fighting to keep power over their own little kingdom"". If you want to experience GoT real life, be SAP's guest. Often multiple organizations worldwide work on a very similar problem but instead of joining forces they're just making up arbitrary differences to avoid a conflict and keep their SVPs independent. Important technology decisions are made by SVPs and Architects in committees where 90% of the people haven't written a single line of code in decades. Every tech decision is affected by the ""not-invented-here-syndrome"" and instead of reusing existing proven OSS tech for non-differentiated components a bad SAP-copy of a technology is developed, because leaders believe they can easier sell proprietary SAP tech for top $$$ to their customers. This works in the beginning with some naive SAP fanboy customers but never leads to an industry leading product or technology and long term always leads to the same result: SAP's losing in favor of a much better and cheaper competitor. In general whoever makes the best PPT slides and talks the loudest gets to make decision and the promotion. SAP is a sales machine and not a tech company, unfortunately. Immigration Policies: The immigration policies at SAP are an absolute nightmare. First of all you have to beg your manager and HR to file H1Bs and GC. For GC you have to be 3 years with the company until they start the process, unless you get an exception approval. If you leave the company within 1 year after getting the GC, you have to pay back all the lawyer and filing expenses. The immigration team (HR and Lawyers) are extremely unresponsive and often times don't answer for weeks or months to your emails. You basically have to beg your manager to follow up with HR / immigration on your behalf and even your manager doesn't get answers for weeks at times. Furthermore they have some weird policies like that you have to be in particular T level (career level at sap) to file a GC in a particular category. For example for GC EB-3 you have to be in T2. If you are already in T3 this means in some cases your manager has to temporarily demote you to T2 in order to start the GC process which is just another way of keeping your comp down. Many folks I know are visa-trapped inside SAP on an L1 or E1 visa and SAP uses the visa trap to keep folks inside the company on their subpar comp. Those folks would leave the company within a blink of an eye once they get the right visa. Subpar technology and Engineering: The engineering and technology at SAP is pretty bad overall. Because of the politics often times bad tech decisions are made and because of the bad comp SAP can't get the right talent to consistently create good tech. A lot of the core technologies that you have to use in your day-to-day work were developed and are pushed by the HQ in Walldorf where people live in their own bubble and rarely hear or acknowledge of tech industry trends before it's too late. Over-engineering is a serious problem as well. For context I just want to add that I've worked at SAP multiple years, both in Walldorf HQ and in Palo Alto. The experiences described not only represent my personal ones but are consistent with the experiences of my network in multiple teams and locations, incl. US, Germany and India. The only location which I would mildly recommend is SAP Germany due to very good perks and OK-ish comp (that being said there are much better alternatives there too). It honestly appears like a miracle to me that SAP has a 4.4 Glassdoor rating and is rated as a Best Place to work, but can probably be explained with SAP being very good at Marketing bad stuff as Gold.

SAP is the company you join when you want to retire and end your career. You will not find much growth. You will not learn many new things. People stick with the company just to get their benefits, do their 9-5 and go back home to family. If that is what you want, SAP is awesome. If you are a graduate and want to advance your career, STAY AWAY My general feeling about SAP is that the company is afloat because many other enterprises use their products and its expensive to switch. No new innovation is done here.

Sadly, they promote people to people management roles that aren't fit for the position. It's clear that people are not vetted as people managers, or are not given proper training and monitored. Poor behavior here not only goes unchecked, but it's buried organizationally, HR is not much help. It's also impossible to move around the company, there is no support for those wanting to pivot to other roles, and most managers offer none or absolutely bare-bones career growth guidance through the SAP Talk system, which pays you only in lip service.

","The company is extremely hierarchical and permeated by a lack of accountability. I have seen completely incompetent managers (and higher) getting promoted or, at the very least, tolerated for years. Instead of feedback loops, there are constant political games. Decision making is hampered by tight control of information flows by leaders. The company is also very wasteful and inefficient, throwing huge amounts of money at projects that are then not properly managed and fail, causing internal frustration and customer dissatisfaction. There are many problems that could be solved if management paid attention and cared. Instead, the labyrinthine management structure and constant reorgs make a lot of things fall through the cracks. At the end of the day, customers suffer. Finally, once in management, there are no real means to advance one's career. Nearly all important positions are filled without any competition.

* collaborative environment. This is key to feeling welcome and at ease at work. And my cross-team colleagues helped me feel like one of their own from my on-boarding 7 months ago; * mature (balanced, no drama) work approach; * good compensation in accordance to the knowledge and potential level; * excellent work-life balance; * professional and friendly recruitment experience: moved very fast for such a company of this size, to the point, friendly, answered all questions asked, multiple assessment levels (future peers included); * excellent ergonomics at the office (e.g. adjustable chairs and desks, natural light for all employees); * great benefits both at the office and outside of it, all to support balanced and healthy (both physically and mentally) and smart individuals; * work ethic: delivering quality to make the world run better. And this is for real, not just a bunch of words. (I am really proud to work in such a company); * inclusive: diversity is taken into consideration in all its dimensions; * flexible working hours, as long as the deliverables and timelines are met; * no micromanagement, but empowering approach; * I feel I can learn from my peers and management team. The country manager is someone I came to admire, being around the man on a daily basis; * talent is valued here, and you are really supported into becoming your best, if this is what drives you as well.

2018-12-15,Anonymous,Pune,Former Employee,"Great technology, shifting priorities, at risk of staying relevant","This review is applicable for Pune center. It's been while since I left the company, so my views are bit dated. Pls take it with pinch of salt. I had relatively long stint at the company, from the time when the Pune center belonged to Sybase. Saw the usual corporate shifts in priorities. Pune center was beneficiary when I was around. During my time, the quality and breadth of work delivered from Pune center was phenomenal, across multiple product lines. Synergy with US dev center was also admirable. We hired from premiere institutes and were able to develop key technology pieces in database world. The release weren't always of highest quality with relative inexperience of local leadership but the product leadership supported the talent very well. Then SAP acquired Sybase. Along came HANA with new ideas, order of magnitude higher support in budget and competing in the same market that Sybase played in. The cross-family wedding sort of resulted in HANA being the favored child with a vision of dominating database market. All other products essentially became enabler for it. From what I hear, the quality of work developed from Pune is still excellent, albeit the vision stays HANA-centric.
","I'd resist commenting further on Sybase products not in focus, but it's heart-breaking just thinking the grand vision we were nurturing. I'm not sure how geared up SAP product line is towards SAAS/PAAS world of today. I don't hear much about SAP cloud, or db products on AWS/Azure (two dominant cloud infra providers). From my own experience and what I hear, the Pune center sort of gets neglected in terms of benefits. Food, transportation are assumed in today's talent acquisition driven market. Global policies should not come in way of making the benefits attractive towards local market.

Many employees have the flexibility to leave at 3 pm to pick up your kids or do other errands and log back in later in the evening. Many people on the team are very friendly and willing to help if you need any. If approved by one's manager, some employees could work from remote locations with a lower cost of living and maybe visit the California office once a quarter. My manager valued your opinion a fair amount. My manager would ask me frequently what the manager could do to improve the team culture or the general team atmosphere. My manager would also bring this up in team meetings. Management would ask you if you are happy or unhappy an what they can do to help you move to the role you ideally want to be in. Other perks Free lunches provided for full-time employees company matches 401k up to 5%
","The work is very monotonous but the great people on the team and the great team culture made the monotonous work more bearable. The pay isn't very good especially for the SF Bay Area's cost of living. The opportunity to advance in this role is very limited, and the opportunity to learn is very limited. SAP has too many hiring freezes or budget freezes- this makes it very difficult for a manager to hire even if he or she has an urgent need to.

Pros
Great teamwork - colleagues are eager to share their vast knowledge, people are open for collaboration and are customer-focused. Exposure to the biggest IT projects in the industry and many opportunities to learn constantly. If you're not a fan of manager's career, you can grow as an expert in your field, and get competitive salary. Thanks to the big size of the company, you can and should network to get new career paths and opportunities without leaving SAP. Work-life balance in my role is really good.
Cons
It might be a bit difficult to introduce and implement improvements or new projects - in some areas people tend to be too formal and bureaucratic. Some processes are a bit too sophisticated and can be further simplified. Crunches sometimes happen in sales or development teams. If your manager is not too good at leadership, you might struggle with career growth and learning opportunities.

It is not the case in one team only but I found this issue with most teams. I have never seen this type of culture in all my career in Bangalore. Ariba is ruining the work culture ethics.

Management acts accordingly to constructive criticism and is interested in hearing what can be improved! Employee surveys go out every now and then. One of the questions asked are ""If you were offered a similar position at a different company with more pay, would you take it?"" My answer is always No!. I have been asked by friends at other companies to work for them who entice me with a higher salary but it would take a whole lot of money for me to take the switch. Many other companies cannot offer what SAP does for their employees.

-If you're not a top performer, it will take a very long time to move up the chain if you stay in your current position. On the other hand, it forces employees to think outside the box to try to reach for higher goals.

In the first 18 months you will receive a lot of training. CoE and Message Solving promote on the basis of merit, and nothing else. Generally supportive culture amongst employees. Middle Management are hardworking, and put in long hours. Located on SW edge of Dublin. Rent is reasonable, in the area, but availaibility is not existent. It is healthier and cheaper than much of the rest of Dublin. Excellent opportunities for growth and development. You will learn a lot in five years. But it can be very hard work. Your background does not count, only your intellect and workrate - in the CoE, and Message solving. In the other departments, I do not know.
","Pay. SAP IRL is no longer in the top tier of ""Great places to work"" because of pay, and pressure in the two largest units. This is usually a predictor of a staff losses in the following year. Promoting staff to promotion levels, and then not paying them the minimum salary levels for that promotion level. In 2018, the average pay rise in the CoE was 2.9%. The increase in pressure in the 12 months previous was much greater than this number. In the CoE, training is classified as Non-Productive. This is a first for a German company.

I joined SAP because of its amazing reviews in Glassdoor and I still say its not at all wrong. if you join SAP India make sure you join main SAP campus in Bangalore which is in Whitefield. I joined in successfactor SDO which is based out of salapuria softzone in Bangalore. There is absolutely no SAP culture there 1. Food is free but pathetic and no options. You goto main campus you can see a google environment in terms of food 2. Absolutely no facilities in salapuria office. Nothing no gym no proper washrooms , pathetic building ,cabins ,seats, ac,....and many more. I like my old TCS office better 3. No flexibility in terms of work. Management doesn't promote work from home at all 4. Most of the higher layer management is from small companies except few so they dont even know how a product based company works. You will end up in a same culture as any other service firm 5. Most of the managers don't even listen to their employees and spends time on their own. Never ending meetings is an attraction 6. You can see one becoming a manager from a lower level if you know art of soaping and it mainly happens because of again low quality managers at higher level 7. Forget WFH clause in offer letter this is not for you but for real SAP campus employees. Don't expect any flexibility. Its same as a service company 8.

","- Too bureaucratic. - Way too many layoffs, sometimes with horrible euphemisms such as simplification. ""Hey, life is simple, you don't have a job"". Literally folks were saying ""I've been simplified"". I can't stress how bad this hurts morale, and productivity. Folks stop helping each other because they don't want to make themselves irrelevant. It was fascinating and terrifying to watch from the inside. - If you are good at your job, it's difficult to move up as your manager will likely not let you go. (This was ultimately the reason that I eventually left) - For services, there are VERY high utilization numbers which means you'll have to do training / self-improvement on your own time. You'll also likely not take some of your PTO in an effort to make your numbers (and ultimately your bonus payment) If you end up on short term assignments, it will be nearly impossible to make your numbers. - You don't always get a raise. When you do, it's likely fairly small. Over time inflation means you make less. - There are some new ideas that make no sense. Example: They changed the employee evaluation system to something called ""SAP Talk"". You no longer get rated. You simply have a conversation with your manager and set some goals. But you aren't rated. You have NO idea really how you are doing. You have no idea how your performance will affect a raise (if any). I feel like my career went into a big fog once the ratings went away.

Pros
Within SAP, there are huge differences between the business groups (on-premise, Concur, Ariba, Fieldglass) when it comes to working atmosphere, tasks and culture but all business groups do follow the same HR and finance structure. This is from SAP Fieldglass perspective: - Lots of responsibility - Complete free on how to complete the tasks - Management is always open to listen - Management is easy to approach - Very informal way of communication - Diverse colleagues, no discrimination - Focused on end-customer - Flexible when taking holidays and working from home - Good base salary and generous benefits like pension, health insurance, etc.
Cons
- Internal promotion is capped to 10% salary increase despite external hires receiving a higher offer - Not transparent about profit and added value by business groups, teams and individuals - Every team has their own rules - Lots of misunderstanding between different business groups on how to work - Development of the application is very US focused - Higher management is predominantly US employees and teams - Employees that do not function well and not coached or reassigned to roles that do fit them

2018-09-07, Senior Product Specialist,,"Current Employee, more than 5 years",Best Place for Working Parents,"SAP is one of the best companies I have worked with over my career. I actually left for another company and came back because I missed the pro-diversity and pro-collaboration corporate culture where everyone treats each other with respect. I had my first child last year and my management team has been nothing but empathetic and accommodating in providing me flexible work options. I am also very fortunate that my family and I enjoy the best benefits package we have ever seen. Aside from the fact that the company takes their employees' well-being so seriously, but they have an amazing suite of products. SAP really is going to go places. I am really proud to work for SAP and look forward to more of its success. Our CEO Bill McDermott is very personable. As an employee I appreciate that when he passes by he takes the time to say hello, shake hands and spend a few minutes. He takes employee feedback and comments in all hands meetings very seriously. He is a great leader and I wish him continued success.
","SAP is a corporate entity like any other; therefore there will be pockets of misunderstandings between employees and their management on certain teams as in any other company. No company has perfect management across the board. But seriously this is truly a very solid and amazing company. No cons to share. I may be sounding very uppity and high on SAP but trust me, I left and saw the outside. I came running back.

Despite being a huge corporation, one does not feel like being just a (i-) number. Always technologically advancing which while challenging is fun. Great corporate culture and diverse workforce.

","The support department feels like a punishment. You receive large volume and are harassed for updates by 4 or 5 different people for most of your tickets. Some issues are technical and require a lot of research and thinking. You can do neither here unless you work extra hours. To make things even more insulting, the people who bother support for updates get paid more than support. Somebody with no technical background at all can get hired on a team called preferred care and their managers reward them for harassing support. Sales and account representatives lie to customers about functionality and then when the customers get upset we're told that we need better support. Everything falls back on support and all management does is get in our way and make it hard for us to get anything done. Many of the actual issues we troubleshoot have been around since before i started with the company which was years ago. When we bring issues up to management we are told that we are being negative and then management just talks about how good we are doing even though its pretty clear that most customers and most employees are miserable.

Unlike the last MAJOR global software company where I spent 13 years and was extremely political, discouraged individual contributors, and prided themselves on stress factor, SAP seems very focused on people, work-life balance, and a team culture. I actually love going to work everyday and feel valued and appreciated which strengthens my loyalty and dedication to this company. Highly recommend.

Pros
In a global organization, considerable flexibility is provided to allow you to perform your duties in a way that fits in with your lifestyle. This can be home working, or different hours to suit both your international colleagues and your own preferences. Freedom is given to you to add to your own role and follow initiatives that develop both yourself and the company. Colleagues and managers respect your abilities and seek to provide stimulating challenges in a positive environment.
Cons
To ensure a degree of uniformity, there are often procedures that have to be followed that can sometimes be a little tedious, but not unnecessarily so.

2018-08-23, Software Developer,"Vancouver, BC","Current Employee, less than 1 year",SAP - The Goldilocks Workplace,"- Awesome people: I've worked for many different companies and in multiple industries - these are the best co-workers I've ever had. It's not just confined to my team either; I find myself making friends with people in completely different teams, and pretty much everyone I run into is easy to get along with and respectful. Oh, and did I mention - there are some REALLY smart people working here. - Great work-life balance: I'm not constantly in crunch mode or working late/working weekends, nor is there any pressure to do so! - Interesting work: I find the cloud-based analytics product we're working on to be very interesting - I can see the value it actually has to a business, and I feel challenged to innovate and pump out amazing features. - Fun culture with cool perks: You'd think a German enterprise software company wouldn't be fun, but it's quite the opposite! The Vancouver Labs have all sorts of fun events that go on - food trucks, buffets + beer on the rooftop, annual summer & Christmas parties, therapy puppies, e-sports event tix (SAP sponsors Team Liquid), a lunch card, and the list goes on and on... It really is the ""Goldilocks Workplace"", in that it hits a happy medium in all the right spots. Decent compensation, interesting work, with just the right amount of pressure and innovation to keep things challenging in a good way. It's stable, secure, and the company's prospects are blue skies and green pastures all the way. It's a company you can see yourself staying at for a very, very, very long time. I recommend it to all my friends and loved ones, knowing that I'd be doing them a solid by getting them a job here.
","- The rumor mill is that while SAP pays somewhere in the top 5th percentile, some of our competitors (e.g. Salesforce, Amazon, Microsoft) pay even more. I guess you have to ask yourself, what's that extra 20%-ish pay bump worth trading off? - The business can be very old-school corporate in some aspects, with word from Germany trumping the needs of local teams. It gets really annoying, for example, when the annual 3rd/4th quarter headcount freeze hits, because you know it always lifts at the start of next year, and all the hiring gets done then. I feel bad for really good candidates who are simply ""unlucky"" in the timing of their graduation. There's also the odd business policies occasionally, such as no more on-site stationery. Not a big deal, but it's a good example of the strange instructions that come down from HQ sometimes. It's a behemoth of a company, with lots of constantly shifting parts - but I'm sure it's the same at most companies of this magnitude. - Not all roles are built equal. While I personally have had a great experience, I do know that in other teams and other roles (non-dev roles), there may not be as much opportunity for advancement or innovation. So, to whomever reads this, please keep in mind that my perspective is from that of a Software Developer role - take that however you wish.

2018-08-23, Sales Support,"Montreal, QC","Current Employee, more than 5 years",Ratings are inflated by internal PR campaign,"SAP provides good pay grades for some positions (esp. in Sales and Presales, esp. for millennials), and is a solid, stable employer for development positions. SAP as a global organization has great values. It's good to work for an organization that recognizes that purpose is a strong motivator and that it has an important role to play in the overall social fabric, not just making money. Flexible hours and the possibility of working from home are a great perk. The SAP Canada organization organizes some interesting employee-centered events, largely due to the dynamism and initiative of local employees.
","I really don't understand why SAP Canada is rated so high, unless this is driven by an internal PR campaign. Ratings were very bad around 2016, then it looks like someone figured out they had to improve their Glassdoor position and started asking interns, new employees and managers to review positively. SAP is an IT company and despite lip service paid to embracing gender diversity and making room for women in management, it remains a profoundly misogynistic company, and what is more, it doesn't realize it is or if it does, is painfully slow to do anything about it. The talk is all up, up, up, SAP is great, oh look at all the great women leaders we have, but if you talk to other women in non-management positions, the dirty secret is that women feel their opinions and contributions are not only unrecognized but devalued and disregarded again and again. Some women in management are put on a pedestal and revered, and held up as the proof that SAP is a great place to work for women, but this is simply not the case. Unless you’re part of the boys club, come from the outside with impressive credentials or are simply a ruthless corporate climber, you will get nowhere with this company. This is a hugely political organisation. Don’t expect to get anywhere unless you’re already a manager or very well-connected. There are many stories of employees who do next to nothing but are protected by their connections. It’s not unusual for upper managers to take the credit for lower-rung employees’ inputs and going to HR is worse than pointless. Their job is to support management. Any claim you bring the them will be ignored until the problem is so huge that they can’t ignore it anymore, or unless they’re looking for an excuse to get rid of the person complained about. Huge egos are rampant. In fact, it’s next to impossible to advance unless you possess one. The global SAP organization has some wonderful stated values, but in actuality, few people in management actually follow them. The effort to ""Build bridges, not silos"" is only recognized when management does it, ""Tell it like it is"" is a wonderful philosophy but in actually, people are afraid to speak out because, as stated, SAP is a highly political organisation and their careers will be compromised if they really do say what they think (esp. if you're a woman). ""Stay curious"" is great advice but is hard to follow when you're working 50-60 hours a week and there's no money or time for offsite training. Yes, the company has flexible hours and you can work from home, but in many roles, this is the only possible way to get the job done and raise kids at the same time, because every job in the Sales organisation is extremely demanding and cannot be accomplished without working in the evenings and weekends. (It seems very different for development roles). Unless you're very technical, have an MBA and/or are willing to relocate to the company's larger business centers (Toronto, Philadelphia, Palo Alto, NYC), there's really very few opportunities for promotion. Bottom line, if you want a career in sales, willing to set your personal life aside to pursue it, are in extremely good health and are able and willing to belong to a boys club, this is a good place for you. If you want a routine job with decent pay, are willing to put up with insane amounts of stress, and are not terribly ambitious, this is a good place for you. If you're a young worker eager to get some workplace experience, this is a good place for you to start. If you're a mid-level career woman (or man) looking for a good, respectful place to do a your job, and even make your mark, the options for you are extremely limited. This place will leave scars on your family and your psyche for years to come, and may even damage your health.

Pros
I've been with SAP for only a few months but the company overall treats its employees really well. The compensation is competitive. The benefits are above average. Vacation is generous. There's a lunch program and they take care of your transport. There's a stock ownership plan and there's a pension plan. Some of these benefits are hard to find in today's market. SAP's CEO Bill McDermott is truly an inspirational leader. Upon joining the company he has increased revenue and made an immediate impact. Anytime he speaks at a town hall, he is appreciated by his staff. He even reached out to me to wish me a happy birthday (it wasn't an automated response as we had back and forth dialgoue) Overall the company treats its employees well and it is as advertised. The group I'm on is in downtown Toronto. They consolidated the TO offices into one downtown location. And it's a beautiful location with pretty much everything you can ask for in terms of amenities, food, transit and more.
Cons
As for the team I'm on, it's in a phase that is currently being developed so there is some ambiguity and some uncertainty in terms of projects and stability. But I anticipate once that things pick up in the fall and beyond, work will be active. Working in a organization that has over 85K employees has it's cons in terms of communication time and sometimes even getting things done. But I think this is normal and typical of a large company.

It is one of few companies taking the vision into day to day life and really live by it. The CEO is a great ambassador for the vision and has been always highlighting the vision statement ""help the world run better and improve people's life"" in all-hands and all-employee emails. Each year in October (Month of Services), the employees are encouraged to volunteer in the community during work hours. Compensations (including benefits) are very competitive on the market. Bonus payout has been consistent with great financial performance. The perk of Lunch On Us is a great win. I am not aware of any other tech companies offering such perk to employees. There are variety of food we can choose to use the lunch card. The company has great leaders in defining, revising and driving the strategy in winning the market. Some decisions such as S/4HANA is a great success with strong leaders.
","It is probably one of the common ""Cons"" for global company with many line-of-businesses and product lines. The company is aware of the siloes and working towards simplified organizational structures. ABAP technology has been used in core product lines. There is a lock-in for technology if working for product lines such as ERP or S/4HANA. Business travel for revenue enabling roles is very limited to control the budget. The investment is mainly on knowledge transfer for my line-of-business. Others will mostly be replaced with video conferencing technologies.

Challenges are inevitable in any workplace and SAP has created a culture that allows colleagues to constructively navigate these challenges through innovation and collaboration without fear of failure. SAP respects a distributed workforce and relies on its global population to influence the company direction which empowers employees to be influential and successful regardless of where they work, even home based employees. The company's desire to build an inclusive workplace, coupled with it's strong brand as an employer, is allowing them to reach underrepresented populations of incredible talent who will find an ally in SAP - a company willing to stray from the norms of systemic oppression, making a deliberate effort to drive parity in the workplace for all demographics of people so that individuals can spend their days developing professionally in an environment that empowers them to bring everything they are in order to become everything they want.

With extraordinary performance (when we still had ratings), I didn't even get the regular 4% that everyone else got, only after explicitly asking for it. - SAPsv identity crisis: Pretty much every person I talk to at the Palo Alto location questions what SAP does in Silicon Valley - Prepare to be stuck to your career level: When we still had performance reviews, I had ""extraordinary performance"" a couple of times in a row. Now with SAP talk things became very wishy washy. I still get good feedback, but haven't seen any action or tangible output. My manager keeps pushing things out to ""next year"". Not the manager's fault though. Also, the curriculums I am interested in that would help me advance are unavailable in the bay area, even though my manager supports me in participating. - Processes - Software engineering it a hell at SAP. We have to use a lot of proprietary tools that don't even get the job done, simply because some process owners in Germany have too much power.

The culture is welcoming, supportive, and collaborative, and the calibre of brainpower and talent at SAP exceeds any other organization I've known. There are numerous succession paths (which I have been encouraged to explore), and SAP truly supports career progression. SAP also places enormous value on humanistic values, and leads initiatives - both internal and external - to promote diversity, equality, and education both in their own workforce and around the globe. Additionally, SAP encourages innovation across the business, regardless of role - there are no ""bad ideas"" and all are encouraged to try new ways of doing things.

The reputation of SAP gives me instant credibility with the customer as the vendor representative. I have the opportunity to develop a trusted advisor relationship with my customers and work with them on business critical projects; giving direction, providing leadership and support as they implement SAP's software products across their company. It's easy to maintain and build that credibility with the wealth of documentation and colleague support. I am able to find answers to product questions and develop solutions to implementation challenges knowing I can count on other colleagues across the company supporting me. SAP gives me the opportunity to do what I love to do every day at customers around the world that I would never have the opportunity to touch otherwise. I have the freedom to assume as much responsibility as I wish and rise as high in the company as I am able. Expertise, hard work and results are generously rewarded based on my abilities.
","Customer facing positions can be high stress since you're the face of SAP and you're dealing with decisions that cost millions of dollars and can make or break the customer's company financially. You have to continually study and add to your body of knowledge as new information becomes available on an almost daily basis. You have to continually increase your skill sets to remain relevant. This is not a job, it's a lifestyle. If you don't approach it that way, you'll burn out quickly. The advantage of SAP is the (earned) perception that customers have about the quality of our employees. The disadvantage is that you have to live up to that perception every minute you're in front of the customer.

Pros
SAP has a fantastic company culture. If you want to move up in the organization, the best thing you can do is help other people. There are a ton of training opportunities, and a whole host of other employees willing to help you out if you get stuck on something. Our executive board is full of real people, who are happy to chat with you no matter what your level is within the company. Further, our benefits are better than most other companies in the US, and our salaries are very competitive. It's a low-hierarchy, feel good, profitable company!
Cons
The only downside is that if you're ""home grown SAP,"" meaning you started from the bottom and worked your way up, your salary will be significantly less than someone who is hired in at your position.

","Sales has zero, ZERO idea on what we actually do so they sell something that does not exist. The Customer Engagement Executives (CEE) are just as worthless. They are to help manage the customer while support works on issues, now all they do is demand a solution for the customer THAT DAY (which they already promised to the customer without ever checking with you). Support is left to basically just do whatever the customer is demanding, not asking, but demanding. There is no real scope of what should be supported, it is just a free for all. A customer doesn't like the font the application is written in, well then it is clearly a product of the issue and needs to be fixed ASAP. The volume of work has increased tenfold within a year but the staffing has either stayed the same or decreased due to people leaving due to burnout. Management talks a big game of retaining people, but no follow through. all we are told by the parent, SAP is that adding more employees does not fix the problem. But then even when we get to hire some people it is usually only 1 person and even then there is usually a hiring freeze. So the 20 people you were supposed to get, end up being 1 person, that was supposed to start Jan 1st, but due to hiring freeze won't start until Oct 1. That is if they actually waited that long and didn't look for something else. The pay could be better for the level of stress you face on a day to day basis. Or you can just start not caring about the work as most employees do. For a company the size of SAP you would think they would attribute an entire multi-level office building just for support? Nope, just a third of a floor with about 30 people to support a global community that grows by 10-20 customers a week. There isn't much great or even good about this place as certain departments get all the respect and recognition and the ones doing the actual work just get more work to do.

SAP also compensates their employees more than well and depending on the team they usually let you live in your desired destination.
","It can be extremely tough obtaining a full-time job at SAP. It seems to be you have to know someone to get it in. The common path for young talent is to enter as an intern and network internally to find a full-time role. SAP hires a lot of interns and provides them all the opportunity to find a full-time job, but there is only so many full-time jobs available, often leading it to be very competitive. Due to the nature of the software industry, technology advances very fast, leading to a constant internal structure change. Sometimes this causes teams to dissolve and new teams to start.

Generous benefits for US workers, who get $1200 (for families) from the company each year for out-of-pocket healthcare costs -- to put us on a more equal footing with colleagues in Germany. This kind of sensitivity makes SAP a standout place to work.

","Workloads have gotten absurd in recent years. Software is buggy and engineering is focused on developing new features instead of fixing issues, putting support into impossible positions.

There are very little opportunities for career development within the support organization, and the opportunities that are there are not advertised to the team. The only way for you to get a worthwhile raise is to get a different job within the company, and to leave support altogether. Management is in constant flux, so you never have the opportunity to work with anyone to develop your career in any meaningful way.

I have experienced both, and if you are lucky, this will be a great company to work for.

In general, the US offices are good facilities to work, working from home is mostly not an issue.
","SAP is big, and moves slow. Change is managed by huge teams, with an emphasis on 'manage', not getting it done. At least in the US, SAP embraces the hire/fire mentality: if a team becomes obsolete in the eye of a VP, there's no support for individual team members to find alternative positions within the company: no matter how experienced, talented and skilled these people are, how long they have been with the company. No sanity check by HR. As a result, loyalty is heavily affected, especially among the younger generations.

I was bullied by two managers as I stood my ground for bringing value to customers rather than just closing a deal, they bullied me to the point that I was forced to resign, even though I met the target numbers by 80%. Both of the manager's intentions were to cut cost so they can hire in another region as I had a healthy pipeline built and inside sales could close the deals. They even got promotion from Australia to APAC. This experience brought major depression to me and eventually I had my first Lupus attack. I will never forget how these managers behaved, HR and others knew about it and no one did anything.

2018-07-27, Manager,"Vancouver, BC","Current Employee, more than 3 years",Great teams and solid support,"TLDR: Smart people, cool customers, and supportive systems. Firstly, SAP has some pretty amazing customers. I work with some of the top companies in the world, which is both challenging and exciting. Secondly, SAP empowers you to do your job, then gets out of the way. I've worked at a lot of big companies in the past, and even coming in via an acquisition, I have to say this is a very un-political place to work. The team I work on is brilliant. Some of the smartest people I've ever worked with. Lastly, SAP constantly redefines itself. This isn't because it's chaotic or bi-polar but speaks to how the company embodies the ideals of agile methodology to shift and adapt to the changing market.
","It's a huge company and it can be a bit complex to navigate all the stakeholders and players. While it tries to simplify, it's still pretty process heavy. Hard to avoid that but it's one of the downsides of working for a big company. SAP has a bad habit of promoting stereotypes and not breaking old-boy networks. While it's agile in it's product development, it's waterfall in it's management.

","My personal experience is my manager was given a team they never wanted, and would rather remain in development than management. They are ill prepared to deal with conflict, and treats their employees unequally. It's been made clear that career opportunities and flex work arrangements (a 'benefit' of employment) are rewarded unjustly. The questionnaires passed out by HR are worded such that any real concerns aren't brought to light, and direct confrontation sheds light on the fact that any issues should be swept under the rug.

Business Outlook
Pros
- You're looked after as an employee - Benefits are really very good - Great pay structure and continued pay increases - Good bonus structure - SAP is paranoid and is always working hard to buck the trend, always tries to be different and really do the best for its customers - SAP isn't what you think - yes, it is huge, but inside it's like micro companies and departments where innovation and being different is key - It's not stuffy - I have worked for many start-ups and I would say SAP innovates more than any of them. And has the huge benefit that you have with the backing of such a big organisation - I would say I am proud to work for SAP and enjoy handling objections from those that think SAP is still the ""ERP vendor of old"". - SAP is a job for life in a positive way. You can move anywhere in the organisation, travel the world, if you are willing to work for it. - Results-based: you can work from home, work from the beech, work anywhere. As long as you care, do your job and show passion you'll go a long way.
Cons
- HR is behind emails and tickets, I would love to have the chance to meet HR on a more personal level - Once you've gone through your inductions whilst there is a lot of online learnings thrown at you, you do feel a little alone. - You have to get lucky with your manager, I think the management layer makes or breaks your experience at SAP. - SAP can breed 'career junkies' - where you'll only succeed if you appease the right people, rather than being fantastic at your job or the right person to succeed. It still is who you know not what you know or who you really are. But perhaps that's life and not necessarily just SAP. - I regularly receive 1 billion emails each day! - Portal portal portal - I'd like human human human please.

2018-07-12, Design & Development,"Dublin, Dublin","Current Employee, more than 3 years",Slow decline from great company into bureaucratic nightmare.,"1. Good starting salary. 2. Training budget available. 3. Great benefits.
","1. Budgets are really low and have been getting lower and lower over the past few year, whether this is for team events or employee run initiatives. We are a multi-billion dollar company, yet management can't find the funds to allow a basic team outing. It is expected team members pay their own way to team events. 2. Progression is really slow. You can expand your skillset as much as you like, but you will be thrown around from manager to manager and have to restart all of your progress. 3. Some people are really lazy, do no work, always have some excuse, and management does nothing about this. This is highly demotivating as promotions are given to people based on time and not on who deserves them. 4. SAP pretends to focus on early talent, but more often than not it is senior people who are given budget for training, further education and conference attendance. 5. Due to other team members laziness, you can have a lot of downtime with no work to do due to blockers. There is no thank you from management for finding work for yourself to do when you are in a lower position. 6. Mental health isn't a focus at SAP. My positive mental attitude has been slowly declining since I joined SAP as I am surrounded by people with a negative outlook. Getting reviews on your work can be highly toxic, as people don't know how to provide feedback without being rude. 7. Prospective employers are worried that ""all you know is SAP"" due to SAP outdated technologies.

Work can be interesting if you put yourself out there. This is a great job to start with and a lot of people move from SAP Ireland to other offices where the pay and conditions are much better. They are ok with you making mistakes as long as you learn from them and they expect you to look foolish to begin with as they send you onsite after a very short time with the company. You will also find yourself leading teams onsite within a year or two. They send you onsite to learn at the sharp end, for some this is a con but its not really. You will be in front of project managers, program directors and sometimes even a CIO where you have to explain why SAP isn't working and why thousand of people at the customer cant work that day. So this sort of stuff really builds you up and lets you deal with anything that is thrown at you. You get used to learning on the plane. You get to travel a lot too.
","Pay is very bad unless you do a lot of extra tasks which allow you to double it . The issue is you then have no life and you only increase it to a decent salary in line with what you will get elsewhere in Dublin for a more mundane position. We support the US a lot by working a later shift at times. 3pm to 11PM. The workload is all very random and last minute. So you will often end up doing tasks during EMEA hours and US hours together. Think 9-10am call followed by 3-11pm in the office and writing last weeks report at some point because the customer wasn't prepared the week before and it ran on. Then you are asked if you can drop next weeks shift and fly to Mexico over the weekend. You don't have to say yes to it all but the bad pay means you kind of do in order to top your salary up.

Work is super flexible and management usually are happy to give you lots of accomidations like working non-normal hours, working in a meeting room ect. as long you deliver on your requirements.
","You are a number to management. Almost all of my managers actions can be summed up by the phrase: ""It will look better for his team's stats"". Also managers are constantly fighting for work off other managers in the same org unit. Until about 2 weeks ago i was on a team with almost 100 people under 1 manager. I can tell you several managers favorite people who get the most benefits regardless of performance. Due to it being a large org i have had projects taken off me no matter how much prep i have done for very silly reasons. And this will impact my career. Things like ""new employee needed to ramp up/ this employee had no work to do/ looks better if this employee works on this"" and usually ends with ""you can work on this other thing"". Basically if I get a customer to agree to do some work and do a lot work to achieve that, there is no guarantee I will get the benefits for it. Heard my manager say to some new hires the phrase ""we dont train you like we used to, we rely more on on the job training"". And I know for a fact that he believed that this was a good thing. Cant guarantee that your skill set will be useful in a few years as teams are created and destroyed regularly. (Employees are usually just moved onto other teams.)

Old timer ruining this company. These guys do not have basic etiquettes . Join this company if you have no self respect and can shift delete your past knowledge and achievements
","1. Lot of politics . 2. Your hike is not aligned to hard/smart work you do . You should be in good book of so called VP/Director to get good hike irrespective of your performance. 3. Openly you will be threaten not to screw your managers rating . 4. Aged old technology (still this company run on server side UI so called AWL and single threaded ORM EO) . No where you will find these technologies are being used. Never gets changed as well till these old timer are here, they are working on these from more than a decade and all talented new joinee struggles and old timer remains relevant. 5. Old timer don't have basic etiquettes, they are not hesitant to pass on dirty personal comments on others . 6. Review(code) process sucks it is another tool for old timers to torture and show their relevance . 7. Service based mentality , even company has work from home and not fix work time . If you exercise your rights you will be in bad book . 8. To remain in good book of your boss, you should hang around people of his choice, visit temple, shouldn't smoke and drink, don't talk much to female colleagues. 9. Everyone in company know what is wrong with old timers but no action can be taken. They just become stronger by everyday. No hope at all. 10.

You will learn so much about Enterprise software and how a large tech vendor functions.
","Politics, politics, politics. The organisation is rife with political Mumbo jumbo. Some of your colleagues will spend most of their time cajoling senior managers to get favour and promotions. If you’re not a yes person be prepared to have a big target on your back. A large portion of managers in ANZ are not leaders and have been promoted after decades in the business as such all they understand is process and the SAP way. Any attempt to provide a different point of view is stifled. Commissions are rarely paid correctly and on time. I had numerous instances of waiting 6 months+ for commission and managers were not supportive in escalation. Overall be prepared for a highly political organisations, with unhappy customers and a very old school on premise technology thinking.

2018-05-19,Anonymous,,Former Employee,Application Specialist,"High profile clients, good coworkers
","BE WARNED: if you accept a job as an Application Specialist here thinking it's a day job with normal (7-9am start and 4-6pm end), you might end being mistaken. Management hires separately for the night shift on support, but does not hire separately for second (swing) shift. So, upon being hired as an Application Specialist, there is a chance you will be put on an unusual shift requiring working until late at night and/or on weekends -- for an undetermined amount of time, often a year or more. Working on a swing shift does not come with a pay increase, though obviously it comes with a lot of added stress both personally and professionally. Management overall is poor in the Support department. Within the department, it can be very confusing and frustrating to understand how to ""move up."" Management is very cagey and stubborn about title or pay increases. While there is an official set of expectations in terms of how to be promoted within the department, management tends to delay or insist you ""aren't quite there yet."" Employees accept harder, more complicated work without title or pay increases in the hopes (and sometimes, with assurances from management) that the title or pay increases will come in the future. Some end up working months or more than a year without seeing the promotion. Support department management often had a hostile attitude towards employees that can create a toxic, tense, and needlessly stressful work environment. Some fellow coworkers of mine have described it as being similar to a ""high school"" environment in which employees are treated like misbehaving children. Almost everyone works incredibly hard, but the department seems to be perpetually understaffed, and this gap between work to be done and number of workers is not treated empathetically by management but rather as a fault of the workers. It often felt like the Support department was stuck in a limbo state between being a call center (think Comcast) or a more typical support/application consulting department in a tech company. This can end up being quite frustrating as an employee -- especially in the earlier stages of working on Support, your job is very numbers-driven, and you will be strongly expected to handle a certain number of support cases per hour. Simultaneously, there is a strong expectation for Support employees to become more like ""consultants"" in terms of having in-depth knowledge of highly technical concepts and processes. As you might imagine, it is stressful to feel stretched by two seemingly opposing sides: I need to close X cases today but I also need to handle this very complicated and technical case that would truly require hours of research to grasp. Other parts of the company often felt at odds with support rather than on the same team, adding to the sense of pressure to do things both quickly and perfectly.

As in many performance-based organizations, many of the negative reviews about unattainable goals or leadership holding employees back, are by low/average performers who expect praise and promotions to be handed to them. I have experienced firsthand how quickly you can move through the ranks if going above and beyond goal is an expectation for oneself. Personally, I would encourage anyone who wants to get their foot in the door at a great company to start in Market Development as it has provided an amazing foundation for future successes in sales roles. Effort is directly correlated to success in this role, so if you come in ready to work hard and earn good money while doing it, this is a fantastic role for you. Both directors and managers are ultra-transparent about expectations and run the department as a true meritocracy. Market Development leadership did a great job broadcasting the performance of high performers to leaders of other departments as to help with promotions.

Only rely on if manager likes you or not. 3. Internal transfer is very unlikely. Once your manager knows you wanna move. last year's bonus will be much less than others. And no promotion or salary increase no matter how hard you worked last year. 4. Gradually, have to worry about what to do next week. Cause manager pushes you everyday to do billable tasks and push yourself to find it. 5. It is said flexible working hours, but someday your manager may check if your in-office hours is enough or not.

Flexibility to work from home. However this is a double edged sword wherein the client expects your availability at odd working hours with no appreciation or backing from managers to stand up for employee's work-life balance.

2018-04-17, Applications Specialist/Analyst,,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Gaslighting, Sexism, Terrible Management & Communication","Free snacks, happy hour, new office building.
","Communication: You don’t know of changes before they are put in effect. Communication with managers is terrible. It is never an open forum. When you bring up examples of something – they will ask ‘who said that’ or ask for specific names. So there’s a lot of finger pointing and blaming. The lack of communication is comical at times. Every bit of information I learned about when people are being hired, when people are moving to other departments, any changes at all has been from a colleague. Sounds like a rumor mill because it is. And it isn't that they are waiting to finalize things, we just never hear anything from management. Silence. Role/Promotions: Roles work in whatever way allows management to favor who they want while not paying people for the work they do. Promotions are based on an arbitrary and subjective list of attributes of the employee, but even if you “check all the boxes” promotions are seemingly only possible once a year so be prepared to be told month after month that you will be promoted in the coming months until an entire year goes by. Moving from help desk to PMO support should be a title change – its’ different work, more difficult, deserving of a pay change. It is incredibly frustrating doing the exact same work as a colleague but knowing they have a different title and are being paid more for their work. If the managers really love you, (meaning that you have completely bought into their terrible management style and decided to take on that approach), they might create a role just for you and never actually hold interviews or make public that a new role has been created. The favoritism is out of control. They have also invented new roles, basically getting people to do the managements dirty work, and asked application specialists and analysts to take it on. Again, no title change and no raise. Just way more work and responsibility. Skill and experience are not rewarded here. Ever. When other people responded negatively to this new role, management repeatedly claimed it was what we had asked for in a survey given out. In reality, we had asked that our managers be more available. They basically did the opposite by putting more people between us and them. Gaslighting: Management blames productivity on the people left in a department that is clearly understaffed and often employs gaslighting to get their employees to comply. If you messed up and have an understaffed department don't make your employees feel like they are to blame for not doing enough. They are always working hard. How about thanking them in a genuine way? Maybe even apologizing when management messes up? Do you really want to be a manager using a tactic for psychological abuse on your employees? Probably not. Management Style (or lack thereof): When starting, there is a sink or swim attitude. If you don’t pick it up on your own and exceed without any help, then you fail. There are hardly any resources for anyone who is failing besides being reprimanded. Their attempts at improving morale are embarrassing and as soon as they see any major issues going away they return to their same ways, which have proven time and again to be very very bad. They operate on a 'putting out fires' mentality. There is no forward thinking, no planning ahead. Management has made it seem like they don’t have time for meetings. And then they get mad when their employees don’t go to them with concerns or struggles. If you make yourself unapproachable and continually have a bad attitude, you cannot expect people to go out of their way to seek guidance from you. Management loves to ask rhetorical questions in meetings. It is a way to belittle staff. The relationship between manager/ employee is not professional. Shifts: Management did not make it enough of a priority to inform applicants of the possible shifts they will work. Instead, they make vague statements when asked if we will work a typical work week. Honesty isn't really their thing. Instead, they lie and then treat their employees like children who weren't listening when they explained how it all works. If you end up with a “swing shift” you are treated as though that assignment was a deserved punishment that you need to earn your way from in order to get a day shift. People who started at the same time as you will have your desired shift from the start, not having earned it in any capacity. Sexism: It was difficult to imagine my career growing within the support department because management was almost entirely made up of men. Any efforts made to provide opportunities for socializing and bonding within the department were based around male-dominated interests and activities such as shooting and fantasy sports leagues. There was no effort to come up with activities that would be inclusive of all interests or at least have a variety of activities covering many interests. Outside of support, men in higher up positions continuously creep on younger women. The environment of the company allows them to keep doing it.

","- No medical insurance policy for spouse or children or parent by default. - Company facility is very bad, cannot even think this comes under the great business leader SAP. - The day I joined to my respective office(nandidurga road- SAP Ariba), i flet so sad and guilty on my decision and I had rejected another offer and joined here. - The place is full sad and negative feeling all over. -The place will make you feel that you are in a start up set up with no proper facility. - No place to sit. Me and my team members were asked to sit in a conference room(that itself is very small) since there is no place to sit for employees. - If you look around your place very dark, negative and sad/depressed kind of people all around. None of the faces were happy or smiling except the interns. - Here Dev and QA are treated as seperate and different ...not like you see in other good companies where they treat Dev and QA as a team. Dev is like superior and QA is of lowest priority. They treat QA as some nonsense people. - The first day when I reached my respective office at the correct time as mentioned in offer letter, there was no one to guide, no buddy, no manager, no HR people. Had to wait at reception around 50 mins and after long search the security somehow arranged manager's number and then they arranged for some other new joinee(who joined one week before) from team to guide me. So whatever 'bla bla' they tell in the induction is utter nonsense. - After getting IT accessories and ID card again you have to find out your manager and tell 'Hi I Joined your team' . - QA team doesn't have much any relationships with Dev as it run as our older upper/lower caste system in india where the lower caste people are not allowed in the vicinity of upper caste. - HR team doesn't have any floor meetings or they dont just care how the new joinees are welcomed. - HR team should have a control on how the first day at work goes for the new employees because it have a very good impact on that employee's further days in that company. - They use old technologies and hence made it very complex. - The architecture of the products are worst and complex which actually can be simplified using the new technologies. - Employees feel like the Ariba leaderships are not allowing to move or merge facility to SAP Labs since they don't want to leave their kingdom. Hence the office facility is like 30 years old. - Nothing special about this place.

2018-04-01, Customer Support Specialist,Prague,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Do not join Ariba Customer Support, just dont!","+ bonuses + nice social areas in the office
","Words cannot describe the extreme degrading, stressful and toxic environment of customer support at SAP Ariba. Team Leaders and management are incompetent, abusing anything at their disposal with specific like to torture and lie. - It is a first company where the MBOs (results/numbers) are the only way how to evaluate people. No matter how hard you will try, you will simply not meet impossible criteria. And when you do not meet the Criteria your manager will decide to not ask for bonuses for you because you did not meet those criteria. And of course, they will not tell you. Zero honesty, zero communication. - Management does not respect or encourage the work-life balance. On the contrary, they force you to work afternoon shifts (10 AM> 7 PM) because there is a higher demand when the US comes to work and hiring people in the US is too expensive. There was a system introduced where you can choose your own shifts - in theory only - you cannot really choose anything and you will end up with working late shifts and killing your personal life in the process. - Micromanagement, supervision, following on each minute and constant persecution of employees is a standard - Management cannot fire you because of Basic Human and Employee rights, they will just make sure that you will get the worst of the worst if you allow yourself to speak up. Colleagues are somewhat fine (I was really trying to help people around myself) but you can see yourself how people are demotivated, down, stressed and forced to absorb enormous workload. Burnout symptoms are not just visible to me but also to other people. - You will meet various characters and personas. Some funny, some boring, some rude but in general, people who are not in management positions are the only good things Ariba has. - If you make friends outside of support, it will really open your eyes as to what its like to have a normal job (yeah, not talking about the support though) - You will find out that there is enormous fluctuation - most of the people will not stay longer than two to five months. Products are best described as something that buyers purchase and suppliers are forced to use. The frequency of failures, system downs, bugs is the highest I have ever seen in my life. - There is a saying that every week new thing breaks. It pretty much describes the way the things are. Nearly every day either internal administration app or even our main application is down. - Knowledge demanding products with disastrous administrative applications and ticketing system that actually makes your job even worse. Very difficult to use. Daily work - someone mentioned that with this amount of work you are literally glued to your seat. It is true. - If you start on the phone, prepare that you will speak about 6-8 hours every day. You will face angry customers, huge workloads and you will be in scope every minute. - If you start in the back office, prepare that you will be forced to communicate with the number of the clients via chat at the same time. Tickets are really time consuming and bad and require daily time/queue management. - There is a constant pressure on doing ""more in less time"" and even the demands are increasing (new products, new applications, new system areas etc.) Salary - where some people say that having 30 000 Netto CZK is a good thing, I oppose. Given the current range of prices in Prague, the salary is very low. And unfortunately, there is no raise whatsoever. (unless you are promoted to a different position). Bonuses are somewhat good. Sometimes you can have fruits on Wednesday (if you are quick enough) sometimes you can have one beer on Friday (you really have to be fast). - Currently six days of SICK DAY (must be approved by management though) - Very pitiful two days a month for HOME OFFICE in the BACK OFFICE positions. (even that poor two days must be approved by management) - The Sodexo card with 1000 points a month for meal vouchers and some culture (new thing, kinda difficult to use - we had normal 90 CZK meal vouchers before). - First two weeks of Doctor approved sickness are paid / year. (must be approved by management though) Office and open spaces - having the open office in CALL CENTER of Customer Support is a nightmare. Prepare for constant stress, no privacy, and extreme loudness. - There is not enough of room in the drawers and the noise is constant. People are looking at your back and your monitors most of the time. - The office social parts, some kitchens, some play places are technically one of the best in Prague. So sad that your time to use them is limited to minutes.

","Salary...... Even a begger will earn more. Fresher till senor most employee gets the same flat salary. Horrible place to work, no motivation to work. Reason given by management for low salary is, employees should work in shift, do weekends, take on-site jobs, or spouse is offered job.

2018-03-29,Anonymous,Lisbon,"Current Employee, less than 1 year",SAP NSC - The worst consulting managers ever,"It is SAP, so you can learn a lot by yourself because they really have a huge documentation based on their portfolio. You can move to another country internally. Usually, you will work with the latest software launched by SAP. You can have a good work life balance if you compare with another consulting company.
","The management from NSC is the worst management ever: their focus is only to find staffing for the consultants (put the consultants in projects): I've heard that a manager already forgot about a consultant's annual performance evaluation. They don't try to understand what the consultants do and the growth is based on ""friendship"" or time. The teams are very big: almost 45 people and one manager by a team. The Portuguese old mind in this great company is the biggest problem of this NSC. For example, it is very difficult to work from home, even if this a SAP policy worldwide to reduce pollution. They have a payroll range they don't use and when they use, prepare: you will receive the lowest value. There is a big difference between SAP Market Unit and SAP NSC. Internally, we know each as SAP A and SAP B. The preconception by consultants from others Market Units is strong, mainly from Germany and UK. They don't have enough park for everybody but managers have their own. So this isn't a problem for them and they really don't care about it. For associates and middle consultants, especially. They know all the above problems but it seems they don't care.

2018-03-05, Cloud Support Engineer,Oranmore,"Current Employee, more than 8 years",They treat people like numbers,"It's a good place to start after university. It's also a good place for work-life balance. It's easy to socialize. Environment is relaxed. If you're good in office politics you can get away with little work or get into management easily. Managers in general are paid well, they don't have many responsibilities and are not accountable for much.
","It is not a place for talented or hard-working people. They treat people like numbers. Good work will not be properly rewarded by management as they have no idea about SAP software and the customers. They just do HR related tasks. They can be quickly replaced with no impact as they do very little meaningful work. Management changes often and we get all the time emails about reorgs. In reality a manager who has been 'instrumental' is leaving for a better paid job. Managers don't listen to suggestions to improve the services to customers or improve the performance and skills of the employees. They have no incentives to do so. They just want the numbers in their department to grow. When an excellent employee resigns, they don't try to keep him or her. They could offer a pay rise or some benefits to keep the person. But they let the person go and will hire a few clueless low-paid graduates instead... Soon they hire a clueless team lead from somewhere to deal with the cluelessness of the team. Then we need some clueless escalation teams to deal with angry customers. Great! More numbers! More jobs! The company is growing! We'll be soon a thousand employees in Galway...

2018-02-15, Market Development Representative,"Bellevue, WA","Former Employee, more than 1 year","The opportunity is endless, as long as you start outside of Market Development","-Concur has unlimited opportunities for career growth (once out of Market dev.) -The people you work with are fun, friendly, and you will want to hang out out with them outside of work -The product is amazing, and if you are able to get to a point in the company that you get to sell the product and not a meeting, it really is a value-added service -Great Benefits
","The Market Development team has gone through a roller coaster of management in the past 2-3 years. The current regime has caused a severe downturn in morale, productivity, and trust in the process, and unfortunately Concur as a whole. The rest of the managers have a lot of potential, but are forced to abide by upper management's leadership style. The major issue that I ran into was that I constantly was being talked to like a child rather than a working professional. An awesome pro of working for Concur was their benefits including 25 days PTO, however if you take a vacation, and do not hit your goal (which is astronomically high, while only increasing) you will be chastised. In fact, some were asked ""do you really think you should take that PTO over Christmas with how your month is going?"" The job itself is difficult enough, cold calling is difficult enough. The job of leadership is to be selfless, to be a part of the grind, and to MOTIVATE people, rather than showing up late, leaving early, taking constant PTO, but then belittling their employees when they want the same (or similar) freedoms. You will also need to be in seat for a minimum of 1 year, while attaining the high quota consistently to be eligible for a promotion. Elsewhere in the organization it is based on merit and production for a promotion, however in Market Dev the leadership (primarily directors) were more worried about hitting their own numbers, and how much you can help pad their pockets than your career development. They will do whatever they can to keep the top performers on their team to help themselves, rather than helping you progress in your career within Concur. One final con: At Concur, and now SAP Concur you are a part of an incredible organization that strives to change businesses and lives of their employees as well as yours as an employee of SAP Concur. In Market Development, you are told NOT to attend the all hands meetings, the team celebration lunches, etc. because that time is better suited with you on the phone. This completely secludes the MDR teams from the bigger picture, and thus makes you feel like nothing but a number

Pros
Integrity and honesty is a staple, supportive leadership, great strategic direction and two very tangible cultural phenomenons: 1) truly customer centric, with top level directives all the way down focused on doing what's best for the client and 2) valuing the SAP employees and colleagues. Strong benefits, bonus opportunities, referral programs, paid time off to volunteer...simply a GREAT place to enjoy a career , with growth opportunities and many offerings available for professional development.
Cons
It's a big company, so it can be difficult to identify who to contact within different business groups/teams to address client questions - difficult, but not impossible. I haven't faced an issue yet that couldn't be resolved (meeting or exceeding) to the client's satisfaction.

Pros
>> Supportive direct management and great co-workers >> Free LaCroix, soda and juice >> Incentives/Competitions; although the extra monthly competitions use to include AMEX gift cards and more appealing prizes now you maybe earn a coffee or free lunch. >> Great benefits through SAP, 25 days of PTO, although in this department it's looked down upon if you utilize your available PTO and because you're quota based you feel too much pressure to enjoy your time off.
","*** FACT: The Market Development department has had over 100% turnover in 2017. I think that number speaks for itself. *** >> Excluding direct management, the directors within Market Development run their department with a ""Hero to Zero"" mentality if you are not the top performer that month you aren't even worth making eye contact with (when they even make an appearance on the floor which is maybe once every other week to once a month). Directors run their meetings like camp counselors, playing loud music, cheering while you walk into the meetings until they drop bombs on the MDRs discussing new processes that make your job more difficult and rolling out unattainable goals to make it impossible to hit your quota. At first, this ""Camp Counselor"" leadership style and over the top unauthentic speech is appealing you eventually realize they are constantly speaking to you like children and have no true respect for you as a career professional. Don't ever believe you have a chance to move into a leadership role within the Market Development department. Directors lead MDRs on; whom are more than overqualified, been with the company for multiple years and proven themselves worthy of leadership roles; to think that they have a chance at the roles opening up within the MDR department and then hire externally or in different departments because again, they have no respect for MDRs as career professionals, with one exception, a 23year old that they gave a manager position too because one of the directors had a personal relationship with that MDR. ** Note: Management just handed that MDR the management position without considering any other prospects or making it available to any applicants** - - It's also been discussed that employees applying for internal roles outside of the department have been sabotaged by directors approaching the hiring department telling them not to hire that MDR because they are a top performer and want them to sit in the department and make them more money till they're burned out and leave - - :: Also, there's a ""rule"" that you have to sit in seat in the Market Development department for at least 1 year before being eligible to move throughout the company. No this is not in your job contract or discussed throughout the interview process you find this out after you're hired and are stuck. :: >> Now to discuss the job itself... You are a telemarketer that can be replaced and rotated out. There is no strategy, you do not create relationships with your Sales Execs because you have 25-40 that you support. You used to strategically work with 4 Sales Execs and support their specific territories going after top accounts and helping them bring in quality customers. They changed this process because of the massive turnover they're seeing in the department and now the sales pipeline won't skip a beat with MDRs constantly leaving. You have call center metrics you have to meet every day and if you don't meet them you are interrogated on the reasons why you didn't meet them that day. The micromanaging is absolutely out of control, there's no faith in you that you are a professional that can do your job and run your business properly. This job requires no relationship building just endlessly calling prospects to see if they have 10min to learn about Concur and passing off anyone who says yes to the Sales Exec assigned too the account then getting back on the phones to find another prospect to say yes. ::: Warning: DO NOT TAKE A SMALL BUSINESS POSITION although the direct manager seems great and doing what he can to make the most of that segment, the goals are wildly unattainable compared to the Inbound, MidMarket and National segments. With the consistent failure, the directors put pressure on this segment and constantly question the failure to meet quota when the quotas are near impossible to hit. ::: >> Unfortunately, because of the way that the directors have built this department and treat their employees you see valuable workers losing belief and confidence in themselves and their abilities. It also is quite obvious that this has spread to other departments so moving internally throughout Concur is becoming more an more difficult. It's heartbreaking to see these quality and overqualified employees being so discouraged and leaving this company after buying into the ""Concur dream"" because there truly is value in this company, just not in the Market Development department. There are people that have taken massive pay cuts and steps down in their career to buy into this dream and leave lost, beaten down and regretful they ever left their previous job to become part of this department.

","Sales organization is still as cutthroat as any, shifting culture in HCM business is not positive. Quotas unrealisticall high in some LOBs, so that reps are not making quotas at a rate that you would expect in a high growth business. High SG&A is not well understood, so attempts to reduce SG&A remain ineffective. Cutting sales compensation does not reduce SG&A.

If you're looking for a relatively stable place with RRSP matching and a defined contribution pension, it's a great place to be.
","Org changes in the last two or so years I was there drove me to leave. The SAP Vancouver office has always been hyper political and suffers a little from the ""that's not my job"" syndrome. Many people tend to stick around without adding much value. But a new VP moved in from HQ in Germany and really changed the culture to one of fear and hyper competitiveness. If you're not ""in"", you're ""out"". The only way to get access to impactful, meaningful work is if someone in the inner clique supports you. Nepotism and favouritism are rampant.

Pros
SAP hires bright talented employees; I have never worked with so many smart people. POSITIVE: in HR cloud business, better structure around sales content/learning is an improvement in aligning market messaging - this has long been missing. Innovation- anticipating and investing in breakthrough product devt - like Bus Beyond Bias - very cool, and forward leaning. Breaking out from the pack. Very good - keep anticipating and building for the future, not the past. We need better INTENTIONALITY around the ""anticipating"" - not enough resources out there tracking HR trends/working closely with HR and Business leaders to help drive the innovation, and be there. Bus beyond Bias happened but what's next - many areas are perfect for us to take on. This would be a great investment.
Cons
Too many bully tactics used by leadership. Leaders who yell at, use high-pressure communication, can't be acceptable. Beating the drum harding may get the result- but kill the engagement, and impact customers directly. Still way too little diversity - and that goes for style as well as race/gender. Need to make ""autocratic command and control"" tactics unacceptable instead of rewarding with promotions. We need ""leaders of the future"" - why are our most motivational leaders leaving, or being shown the door? people will follow and go above and beyond for leaders who empower them and provide a real vision based on a true knowledge and passion for the field. Recent changes in leadership in HR Cloud business is right out of the ""old SAP model"" - quickly dissipating energy and motivation of very talented people. Everyone has their head down to stay out of the way. NOT the culture we want. - Career options: I cannot tell you how many ""Fast Track"" employees have applied for jobs internally, and never even gotten a response. We totally should be handling internal applicants differently- any time a ""Fast Track/High Performing Employee"" applies for a job internally - the golden glove should come out. Why are they looking to move? is there an issue? this is data that should trigger a response by management - not just recruiting. It should include a coaching session to understand what they are looking to do, the full context, and then actively look for a role for them. YES - a high-performing employee should have an advantage, AND research says they cost less, and add more value. Why aren't we leveraging this? In the last 2 years, way too many talented people I know left because there was ""nothing"" here for them. They couldn't find a job internally - and we make it way too hard to make a lateral move without sacrificing compensation. This is a real opportunity for us to figure this out because this is the way of the future workforce.

Part of a tech giant SAP which gives good background and experience. Good health and life benefits. Good middle class level salary.
","High tolerance for mediocrity; if you want a steady paycheck then this is the company for you. Incompetent and competent talents have little or no rewards, discipline or recognition system. Just be there and do your job type of thing. Bad hiring > training > learning > retaining program & sets employees to fail; close to no system at all, there is no ongoing training opportunity that will make employees feel growth; same as for their leaders. Stale leadership breeds stale culture; this cuts innovation since leaders stay 5 years to decades in the same role. Oligarch culture; some departments have clique of people or clique of leadership. Some employees to leaders (vice versa) think suspiciously of their colleagues limiting pacing for any improvement and damaging relationships. They would even put you on surveillance so they can find and talk about anything interesting. Then, you'll be surprised that everyone in the company is already talking about it. Rumor culture; is another norm to be tolerated in this company. Damaging any person's livelihood and reputation is accepted, some leaders even join the fun. Social media ranting culture; is wide-spread, accepted and normal. If you want to with colleagues who spend their precious time and energy on ranting (daily/occasionally) about work then this is for you (if you are one of them). Friendliness based performance; if you are people pleasure then you'll be successful here. Talent and commitment are not valued if pessimist and envious colleagues/leaders destroy your reputation. HR also find this culture normal, there is little to non in balance of ethics to weigh judgement on what is right or wrong. ""I hear your feedback"" attitude for employees in authority; they like to hear feedback but nothing will be done on any matter, authority is confusing and seem like a mess on who can do or implement anything that can help. There is some push and pull due to many layers of leadership fighting for the spotlight or the next promotion. Many customer complaints; the laidback mediocre culture creates intense customer dissatisfaction. Like previously, these customer feedback are overlooked in expense of choosing to make employees happy (vs customers). High customer turnover; while growth is always the press-release there is still a lot of customers leaving due to it's old tech and really bad service. This company will be like Nokia soon, because it's the only strong choice for a solution. However, as new companies or competition build stronger solutions, better tech and seamless service this company will be like a rat in a quick-sand.

","- No learning after a while unless you change roles which is very complicated. - Top management (especially in India) way too focused on getting employer awards from various magazines and not on complicated, outdated internal policies. - Lot of irrelevant processes created by older people just to stay relevant. This in turn creates hurdles for quick developments/improvements. - Average engineering talent compared to other product based companies. A tendency to hire people from service based companies and then ask them to make the company as good as the leading companies. Not going to happen. - Incompetent HR department. Great employee friendly policies. But the resource distribution is simply ridiculous in terms. Absolutely no intention of putting the right people in right roles. No steps taken upon feedback. Only thing you listen is you have to come up yourself. Keep up this attitude and most of the talented will keep quitting, leaving the company with mediocre talent. - Finally, older people helping each other out only to keep their jobs. It's appalling how poor most of the experienced people are technically even though their roles involve mostly technical work. - No hiring in mid level or senior roles. People who have stayed in the company for long look out for each other and promote each other. Most of them do not care about the company. No senior expert people for cloud, only lots of fresher hiring. Freshers can only go as far as coding good requirements, but the design and architecture has to come from experts (ther are very few in the company). Most experts have outdated knowledge.

SAP takes a pretty conservative approach to change and taking on new trends, but when they do decide to take on a trend they tend to go all in. The employees are pretty loyal as well, you are paid well and treated well for the most part.
","In my years at SAP I loved it, great work, new products, they do push that they are the 'Innovation Company' but they lack an innovation strategy, they are so far behind their competitors in many regards. HANA was a blip and put them ahead but I left because I wanted to innovate with my customers and SAP was too slow. The amount of re-organisations that happen, change is good but I always felt change at SAP put everyone 6 months back. You get pigeonholed at SAP, if you come in with a specific skillset, trying to move to other places and technologies is hard, Advancement is a challenge as well, unless you are very political.

","I love this company, but it's not without its problems. Hopefully, someone can read this and help to improve SAP. 1, Politics is prevalent. Favoritism is popular. 2, Seniority still favors over meritocracy. 3, Discrimination is pretty prevalent. There is a big difference in treatment between German/White/Germany-office employees and all others: - Same job but German/white people always got higher titles even they are hired at the same time, in the same department and doing the same things. It applies to everyone in my department. Needless to say to salary will be different. - Slow promotion for non-German/non-white employees. - A number of people just got promoted to managers because they are German. I know a few German managers who are doing very little, know literally nothing about the field they're managing, always on vacation but still got promoted quickly to director and VP. It's so crazy. Germans employees sometimes are pretty arrogant and don't value the opinions of their colleagues. The above reason also makes the product is uncompetitive because the weak managers who oversee the products have little knowledge in the relevant fields. 4, Heavy processes which really slows down the innovation. 5, Inadequate equipment. E.g.: impossible to request for 2 monitors.

2017-12-22,Anonymous,,Former Employee,"If you're a fast-moving, high performer, Concur might not be the best fit for you right now","Company growth - They have created a great suite of products and services. There are many untapped markets in the world. There is also a great potential to grow their existing client business. It doesn't take much to capitalize on it. It's just a matter of having the right people ""on the bus"" to maximize returns for SAP shareholders. Culture - Very inclusive, friendly and warm place to work. Lots of great people (don't confuse this as all of them are the best candidate for their respective jobs). Can be fun. Most teams have autonomy to innovate. Work/Life Balance - Most managers allow working from home some or all of the time (for the right people). HR - Their HR team seems to be a solid group of competent professionals, despite the recruiting arm leaving much (all) to be desired.
","Recruiting has been known to lie - There are countless examples of people who were lied to about their title/level and their next move in company. Backwards titles complicates this further. This coupled with much of my other feedback lead to great employees either leaving the company, or leaving and coming back (which the CEO, SVPs, and many other leaders have done). When it comes to hiring your own team, people managers have to do the majority of searching for candidates (provided they want to assure they get the best person for the role). Most mid-level leaders are afraid of and/or avoid confrontation - Bad to mediocre employees aren't disciplined, and over-achievers aren't reward commensurate of their impact. I'm not sure anyone has ever been put on an action plan (let alone fired) at the company, which makes those that are (below) average at their job think that they just have to wait to be promoted. Leaders try to contain over-achievers by promising a bright future if they just wait, then offer you everything you want(ed) when it's too late. Senior leaders lift up concerns about employees, so do said manager's people, and yet no material corrective action is taken resulting in their great employees moving on. Wrong or right, this gives the perception that managers are more concerned with being everyone's friend and are happy with where they are, so they state that ""everyone here is great"" to make things easier vs having tough conversations or potentially ruffling feathers by having some on a faster track than their peers. Top down management style - A lot of mid-level to senior leaders don't take constructive criticism well from their employees. They get the majority of their direction from senior executives, then generally tailor to what their plan was, which delays or fractures career promises (moving targets). They no doubt mean well, but don't seem to realize that if they are authentic 98% of the time, employees are still left guessing when the other 2% is occurring (and if they can truly rely on them for their best interests). Additionally, when you ask them why overall company projections or a product launch deadline were missed, you tend to get boilerplate excuses. Seniority can breed complacence - The most people I've ever seen in a company that have been there for the majority of their career. That's generally a good thing, but many of these people don't have a competitive background for their position that one would expect from an SAP/leader in technology. Diversity (including in professional experiences) is a good thing. A lot of the leaders that have been with the company for the majority of their career likely wouldn't be at the same level at any other comparable company, and many didn't go to school for what they are doing. Perhaps they realize this, so they never leave, and are fine with mediocre employees on their team as it won't challenge their position in company. Because many haven't worked at other major companies, they don't know any better, generally given false positive reviews on their managers and for Concur as a best place to work. Little to no value is given for having advanced degrees (nor do leaders encourage their employees to pursue them) as the company seems to think consulting companies and annual conferences are the only thing needed to help with on-going education efforts.

","Although the job description states that the role is for a Market Development Representative position, you are really an overpaid Telemarketer. The truth is this role consist of cold calling prospects 8- hours a day with the sole purpose of setting appointments for Concur's Regional Sales Executives to follow up with potential new business. The practices that Concur uses to reach out to prospects is the biggest reason I left. You will be forced to mail merge/email blast thousands of new prospects, then follow up with them via telephone. Emailing these prospects constantly, calling them constantly, leads to a ton of rejection. They implemented new software to cut down on the email blast earlier this year, but with limited to sending 250 emails a day, they switched back to the ""spray and pray"" mentality. Get used email merges, daily, sometimes reaching out to 10K people at a time. It seems like they don't care about saturating their territories with constant emails. You must perform well in the Market Development Representative positions for a minimum of 12 months prior to being looked at going into any other role; in those 12 months, you must be hitting 100% to goal each month or you WILL NOT be promoted. That simple. The goals keep getting higher and higher because they want to get to 1 Billion in revenue by 2020. This is constantly preached. This position is best suited for someone straight out of college, very flexible with work hours (some reps work 6:45am - 5:30pm daily), no kids, and live close to the St. Louis Park location. A large number of the current MDR's do not like the position at all, but are working hard to possibly be looked at to be promoted down the road.

Pros
- Vacation Flexibility . - Flexibility with your work time, even if you have to attend some workhours. - Time to work on projects that you would like to, and that do not involve your current position. - Career patch is HUGE, sometimes confusing, but is you dedicate one hour per week to understand it, you will have your future in your hands. - SAP Culture, this is very unique, a place where you can be yourself, without fear. - Many volunteer work, you can see that SAP is making efforts to help others. - Brilliant co-workers, and managers.
Cons
- Re-org, I see people going to other areas that sometimes they would not like to be moved, but in big companies it happens sometimes. - Communication sometimes fail, because of too much processes (I think any BIG corporation will have problems like that, but i had to say something cons right?)

Pros
If you are hard working than the benefits and salary will come. For me everything was more than enough, but everybody needs to take into consideration that the amount of knowledge, work and added value you bring to the company will also increase your salary ad benefits. That being said don't stand around and complain if you are not putting in the work and having a little bit of patience. SAP is a great company from which each individual can evolve professionally, have a great work life balance and meet great people.
Cons
Like in every company there are naysayers and people who complain about certain things, which brings an air of negativity in the work place. Maybe some internal reviews and and problem resolution seminars would help.

A lot of nice and well educated people of different art and personalities. Company supports people development as well as the people themselves. Be ready to be dynamic person and flexible as company moves very fast and changes internally also fast. Be ready for continues learning and self development - company gives you a lot of opportunities to learn, and expects you to grow continuously. Company gives a lot of flexibility in term of your time - flexible working time, flexible hours and even location. The main focus is on the tasks assigned to you being completed. This means - be sure you commit to what is possible to deliver, otherwise it might lead to overtime, which in most cases is not compensated. Be aware: this is a big international company - networking is a key for the career development, and for the daily business. A lot of things are happening in the same time - hence you will be in the situation when something happens and you are not aware of it - keep networking to be simply up to date. In some cases even relocation to other countries and regions is possible. if you young, talented and get to the high potential pool - you might get into the job rotation mode (very selected group of employees). Be ready to move and grow within the company, if you are about to make a management career - be active in this regards. All in all - a nice place to work.
","In some cases internal move is not easy due to multiple reasons, for instance: Due to the support of gender equality: women might be promoted despite better man candidates; The same is related to the age: reaching certain age / seniority level potential opportunities are getting narrower, as many new positions are opened primarily expecting younger people to join and with lower salary groups. The compensation system has been simplified in a way that over-performance is not really supported in form of money (exception is in the sales area). The same is true in regards to the salary increase - be ready to have slow gradual yearly increases - keep it in mind when you negotiate your starting salary. Learn the salary (grades) system - it determines your salary growth.

2017-10-21,Anonymous,"Chicago, IL","Current Employee, more than 1 year","SAP FG - Decent first gig, but don't get your hopes up.","Still has some startup feel to it, even though it was acquired by SAP almost 2 years ago. Solid perks, including a generous amount of PTO right from the start, and ""unlimited"" sick days. The office location is great, right in downtown Chicago across from the Metra station. With backing by SAP, the company is not going anywhere and is miles ahead of any competition in it's industry. For most of the people on the support side, it's a great first job where you can make decent money and have full benefits. Once out of support, the company/management is very nice. Due to the fact that FG makes it's money off of transactions for the clients' contractors, the sales team doesn't have all the power/is not the focus like other companies. Anyone client facing is important to the company as a whole, and management, for the most part, understands this. The company spends quite a bit on keeping the kitchen stocked and regularly buys meals for the day side staff, and there is beer cart Thursdays.
","Support is primarily on the younger side, usually within the 20-23 year old range. For most, it's their first job out of college. Between staff moving to other teams or leaving the company, and the documentation being sub-par at best, most of the knowledge is among the staff, which leaves huge gaps in knowledge. There's rarely anyone that's on support for more than 2 years, The company currently is struggling to balance out the exponential growth of the company with the amount of support agents that they have on staff, even globally. It can be a bit of a meat grinder, especially around the major patches for the application. Day side is the main focus. There are no managers on staff for the second and third shifts, which means those shifts are easily forgotten about. Management has been quoted saying their main goal is to keep you on the support team. Even with support being the entry point into the company, the managers do their best from having you move to other teams. Management is good at changing their language during discussions to fit their motives. Support agents are mostly looked at for their stats from managers that don't have much experience outside their current job. Stats that are hard to balance, and, for the most part, require working the system to make them look better. They do not allow you to work from home. Large office = rarely get to meet other people unless you actively seek out other teams.

The challenges at B2C companies are mostly purely technical/architectural (e.g. Spark or Hadoop for Big Data processing, ML for recommendation, etc.). At SAP, your challenges are more software *application* oriented. For instance, what data does a doctor need to know when a new patient requests and appointment?

I came to SAP from a horrible previous employee and I was shocked at how great a company and the employees could be.
","Different teams and departments struggle with different things. In professional services or consulting (my team) you work long days and travel often. Sometimes the internal processes are time consuming and they do not allow for enough time for you to manage this on top of your customers. Additionally, in professional services, you do not always feel like you are apart of SAP which is unfortunate.

Pros
We have access to a free gym and receive free lunch everyday. There are always fun events happening. There is a patio to eat outside in nice days. There is an IT help desk on campus for help. The dress code is nice because it is not too stuffy. We have a good amount of time off and our benefits are phenomenal. We also have a CSA which I participated in this summer and I could pickup my fruit and vegetables while on lunch. It was super convenient. I also enjoy that once a month a cupcake truck comes what a way to roll in the weekend. My job is great and I have an awesome team I would not consider leaving even if I was offered more money.
Cons
I wish there was better communication with changes. We recently had to change our passwords and there was a lack of communication how to do so and what action would be taken if we did not change it. I think a lot of the meeting rooms need to be updated and have old equipment that does not work. It is a windows focused company and I wish it was more aligned with Macs as there are many users out there.

It just depends on your personal appetite of how much you want to get involved, but it's amazing to have almost full control of your future which is so rare in corporate world. The company is changing fast and trying to accommodate different generations that come with different visions of how a technology company should look like in the future.

I am proud to be part of SAP and really hope that younger generation will also be able to see the potential of this company in the future.

","In my experience SAP and ARIBA are polar opposite to each other particularly the downstream team. The team is full of senile technocrats, as reluctant as the dogmatics (they think they are certain that they are right and that everyone else is wrong). The entire downstream leadership can be tagged to the pool of adjectives like visionless, selfishness etc.. An analogy for the choice of the leaders here can be something like - a fish is sitting on a tree and a landlubber is swimming in the sea. Each leader has his own unique spanning tree - restricted to their clan. Like medieval age, each faction is fighting for the driver’s seat. The recent re-org has put the team into a Brownian motion. The past year has been the least productive except the leader’s enhancing their belly size but all know that - fish die belly upward, and rise to the surface. Its their way of falling. The team is moving towards an irremediable state - it’s on the verge of becoming an NP-hard problem. The excellent SAP opportunities are being taken down the drain by the incompetent and visionless downstream superiors. ARIBA’s leadership and their quintessential ideas are being squandered by a handful of senile, self-obsessed local leaders. An advice to the local leaders - you are sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago- so please refrain from uprooting the tree. People(you and me) may come and go but a healthy show must go on.

You have plenty of possibilities for the career development, professional and personal learning. There is a wonderful ""Google"" atmosphere in the new office building where you keep discovering more and more creative meeting rooms. The salary is motivating and is reviewed at least once per year. The development of your income is purely in your hands as it's fully based on your performance. On top of that there are a generous yearly bonuses paid to all of the employees. The company officially supports and tracks continuous dialog between the manager and the employee, so the managers are on track of your plans and desires, if you are open and honest enough. There is a very attractive Share Plan which is available to all of the employees, where you get 40% on top of your own investment with no ""holding"" period.

","Support is a terrible place if you are young and a recent graduate. You will be doing call center jobs similar to what I is offered at Rogers and other call centers. In-house technology is dreadfully slow and lacking any innovative features. It makes my work 10x slower that it should be. Terrible waste of resources by having to wait for a window to load or multiple clicks to get something done. Desks and seating areas in the Scarborough office really cramped. Everyone complains about it but it is not addressed. Some people in the office (Scarborough) have come across bugs like roaches in their working area (yuck!). Bottom line, if you want a job that pays well and have good vacation, this is the place to be. Don't expect to be working on anything leading edge or innovative. It is more call center by dealing with customer issues through a ticketing system and through chat.

I have been with SAP for more than 3 years and the honeymoon hasn't stop. It is a great company, with very strong value and great people. The job and task you do are very interesting. SAP gives you the freedom to define your own path and wath you want to do.

I am speaking fluent German and English. I am also studied teacher of German at University. I am finding SAP as very profitable company. There is great culture with lot of social benefits. Work is quite easy manageable, but this just in case your team is in good condition. - you can have Home Office 2 or 3 day in week generally - meal vouchers are paid 100 perc. - 3 sick days per year - 25 Vacation days entitlments - Great and modern environment - It can be extremely safety employer, so you will be never afraid that you ll be fired. SAP is extremely social. - If you are bored on some position you can just rotate on to another one.
","- However all benefits are depending on your manager. There are lot of supervisors they became managers just through the good friendship with former managers or they are basically just clubbing with management. - You become lot of benefits as training's, vouchers, home office. However your salary will almost not change. Employees who re working there more than 3 years have maybe just about 80 USD salary rise in total gross. And this is very sad, because newcomers can ask even about 200 - 300 USD more. - You ll never know what are managements plans. Extremely lot of employess are leaving because they are suffering with they salaries. Many of us want to work at SAP further, but we just can not. Reason is the salary is not enough even for single person. I am living from salary to salary. If I would not have another financial support in my relationship, I can not imagine where I would live. I could barely pay better single room. If you want have mortgage, just forget .... - We re sitting in super modern building, but thats all what we can admire. - Many managements decisions do not make sense. Many tasks are moving from Germany to Prague although you will be never informed why. You re just getting some tasks and don t know why

From the past 1 year that I have been working here I do not see any of the ""good review"" points coming true. The team that I am part of has people with more than 10years experience. Bullying, Harassing is very common because of their own insecurities. Lots of politics being played which would not allow a new comer to stabilize at the workplace.

","- Not too Technical : It is not a company if you expect to learn a lot and try out many hot/sexy technologies. You have to follow SAP's technology stack which is very non-flexible and slow. SAP is also not mature for Cloud application development, they even have some stupid bugs that a high school student will be able to debug.

When you come to the office, some people are always chatting, drinking tea and talking about their dogs and cats. Some interns even call here ""SPA"" not ""SAP"" - No training, no culture shock at all : when you step into the office, no one will come and show you to get you introduced to the project, and let you know where they are at (I wonder if they know what they are doing neither). Everyone just stares at the screen, and do not want to be helpful unless you keep bugging them.

2017-06-11, Manager,Bangalore,"Former Employee, more than 10 years",Review of SAP Labs India,"- Opportunity to learning new skills and attend new trainings - Several departments exist so there is different kinds of work happening - Its a big location (2nd biggest Labs outside Germany), hence there focus in terms of Senior Leadership/ Board visits and new product development/ investment - Due to the same reason, various services can be provided due to 'economies of scale', which may not be available in smaller location - Moderately good selection of food
","- Too much emphasis on 'newer talent' which makes you feel old and irrelevant to the organization many times - Too events happening .. leading to too many non-core-work related emails circulating all the time - Pay is somewhat below market - Lots of politics among VPs to become SVPs. Some of them lead a comfortable 10 am - 4 pm schedule with no technical background or skills whatsoever and remain in office just to make sure that they have the dept. HR's backing. They can be seen gossiping with the HRs in their cabins and in the outside smoking zones because they have executive-level and HR backing

You will get to work with extremely intelligent people who are willing to help when they can. There are also opportunities to switch departments depending on what skills you've polished and where your interests are
","- Poorly planned/staffed projects; sometimes you will hear of a new project and have to go on site with little to no background and the client/partner will expect a quick turnaround. Projects are being rushed to start implementation when they are not ready, and the internal project team suffers as a result - There is more pressure put on internal hires/tenured employees because the ramp up time for new hires can be very slow. It can seem like managers tell everyone that they are doing an awesome job, so employees feel there is no difference between those who do great work and those who are mediocre

Can be delicious and not making/paying for lunch makes a huge difference to the pocket. -nice bright modern offices -casual dress -work from home (manager depending) -lovely co-workers, everyone is really nice. -onsite gym -great benefits package -flexi time: Real flexi time, not just flexi start/finish times like most companies. In SAP you just have to make sure you are in during core hours (10am-3:30pm mon-thurs & 10am-2:30pm Fri) and work your required hours around this. This is how flexi time should work! I was very lucky with my manager in SAP as she was genuinely caring and would let you follow any direction or idea you had. SAP is such a large company and heavily embedded in the industry that it won't be going anywhere anytime soon.
","Salary is extremely low compared to other sectors this is due to the MD wanting Ireland to be seen as a low-cost center to impress Head Office which has brought morale down significantly in the company. A lot of reorgs happen too often before they are properly thought out by upper management leaving employees in the dark and uncertain of their positions. Organisation structure is very confusing and ever changing. The company encourage employees to look at internal opportunities to move team however the interview process for internal hires is poorly run. Hiring managers not reading CVs no time to prepare for interviews. Managers & team leaders in the development teams lack people skills.

2017-05-17, Developer,"Palo Alto, CA","Current Employee, less than 1 year",Silicon Valley Next Talent Program,"- Silicon Valley Next Talent (SVNT) Program: SVNT is a highly competitive rotational program and career accelerator within the products and innovation organization at SAP. The cool thing is that you can rotate on multiple SAP teams within the first year. At the end you may select the best fit based on mutually benefits. Therefore, you may develop a big picture mindset about SAP, while contributing your strengths on many impactful product features that are using by the world's most successful businesses. I think this unique program would be the best choice for all new graduates to consider. - Application Process: The review below is based on overall recruiting process of Silicon Valley Next Talent Program. The whole process took about one month (starting from the time that my resume was accepted and I submitted the survey form). The recruiter is pretty helpful and responsive with interview arrangements as well as status updates. The interview process has several rounds. The first round is talking your background with the recruiter. I learned about the recruiting process and what to expect after joining SVNT program. After that the second round interview is with the SVNT program manager, in which many behavioral questions were asked. I enjoyed the conversation a lot and found that the core values and team culture at SAP would be the perfect fit for me. I also felt connected with the program manager when I shared insights about my experiences and lessons learned. The third and fourth rounds are technical interviews with SAP experts in my field. The format and questions were similar to typical technical interviews with other large tech companies. One thing stood out was that all interviewers were super passionate about their work and shared many great things about working at SAP. These conversations really helped me to develop a better understanding about the benefits of SVNT program and I then decided to accept the offer from SAP instead of some other top companies.
","The overall recruiting and on-boarding process in quite smooth and many detailed guidance is provided. I think the SVNT program at SAP is one of the best recruiting process I had ever experienced.

I like how they are now focused in on hiring younger talent to fill in for those that have been with the company for 20+ years

It also says a lot about a company in Silicon Valley when many employees have been there for 10+ years. SAP is a great company to work for and I feel privileged to work here!
","- Difficult to keep demand gen skills sharp because SAP marketing is not as innovative and cutting edge as leaner organizations - Q1-Q2 can be travel- heavy as T&E budget usually gets cut off in 2H - Frequent re-orgs can be challenging to get used to - Any large company can be difficult to navigate and learn who's who. - Compensation is pretty rigid.

Great company over all. A lot of employee support and resources to encourage growth. Policies are all in place to help roles, flexibility to manage a good work/life balance. Freedom to manage own work loads and accommodate team activities during working hours is great. Equipment and resources are reliable to help you get your job done. Free lunch also :-)
Cons
On a company level is is great but on a more direct management level it will depend on the personality of the seniors. The environment is very corporate and not aligned with the a new and developing software companies. Direct management is very poor to support employees. The resources are all in place but no personal empathy from management to build relationships. The sales team are the privileged few who get all the credit, although they contribute very little to the bigger picture.

I joined the company half a year ago and I am really grateful for this opportunity.

I also like that you can always come up with new ideas or innovations. The benefits which are offered are very rich in comparison to other companies.

At SAP I really love the corporate culture and the possibilites you have in this company. The slogan ""Bring everything you are - and become everything you want"" isn't any phrase but reality - SAP is a company where you can grow and develop yourself in a best practice way with the support of your managers. Working with colleagues from all over the world, with a great management and especially with a very young team here in Prague in this great SAP family makes for me ethe work even more valuable.

Cons
1. Top to bottom, except a few, every person in leadership plays politics. 2. Priority given to people from a specific state of the country 3. Inexperienced people are made managers who have least idea how to manage resources and have ""ZERO"" people skills and think the resources are just ""MACHINES"" 4. Some managers expect employees to work for stretched hours to deliver the ""Undeliverable"" 5. Managers take more commitments than their teams can deliver; consequently pressurizing and forcing the team to work for more hours to please the bosses! 6. Undue favour shown to people from specific region/state of the country. 7. Everything happens only by politics / networking / pampering your boss. 8. You will get good annual ratings, only if you can fill your boss ears with bad gossips about others (leg pulling), stay longer in office, no matter you work or not! 9. Management is least bothered about your expertise; interest in any topic; you have to work on whatever technology they say! Advice to any prospective candidate: If the prospective project is in Globalization; and if you are not good at pampering managers, then don't join the team!

You get very good inside of how big corporate works - and SAP indeed is a large one. You experience very corporate and process-oriented culture (if you think of this as a beneficial aspect). Lot of training provided, if you try really hard you can learn many skills even above your job description
","The biggest one - salary. SAP states their salaries are competitive, I don't agree. Most big shared services in Prague will offer you better starting salaries. Company moved to great new offices, but the salary structures remain the same. From my own personal subjective experience, trying really hard at your job, working overtime or being successful with projects doesn't automatically bring you pay rise or promotion. This goes down to your manager, who, in case he/she is in another country, relies purely on judgment of HRBP in Prague (who doesn't even know you) in regards to salary review. In my case, I moved via internal transfer to a job with much higher responsibility and technical knowledge requirements and received payrise of 26 euros after spending year and a half in the company. I like SAP - but it works like in every big SSC. If you are hard working, either you are lucky and your manager makes sure you are happy, or you leave.

Pros
Employees feel empowered and have the complete freedom & control over the work they do. Trust built by the management is immense, there is always the assurance that your manager will be there to rescue you. Very less politics. Flat hierarchy and friendly colleagues. Yearly team outbounds to the best resorts in the south. Open learning resources. Company car lease & AC shuttles. No problem for leaves and work from home options . SAP shares & RSUs
Cons
On the job learning is more vertical. You get to know a product deep and master it, so involving in different products is almost impossible. There is this peculiar first year syndrome seen in lateral hires. They hear so much about the work-life balance and the culture in SAP, a few lateral hires tend to go easy and not push themselves in the first year. Looks like management is also not much concerned about it.

2017-01-16, Support Engineer CoE,"Dublin, Dublin","Current Employee, more than 1 year",Support Engineer COE,"-Great Pension Benefits -Shares scheme -If you're on the right team with the right manager you can get as much or as little travel/shift work as you want for the extra money -If you've got some flexibility you can do some interesting things and upskill -Good job satisfaction -Fairly relaxed environment -Flexi-time working hours are great -Management tries to deal with issues alot of the time when it can. -Free Lunch -Good opportunities to grow and upskill if you can do it informally, and a wealth of resources out there. -Work from home(depending on team) -Relatively young workforce -Senior Expertise is available too. -Work with huge customers -Different job aspects: dealing with customer issues, managing expectations, development, deployment, enabling, empowering. All have their particular fun parts. -Location can lend itself to much cheaper rent for new hires due to its location. plus red line luas, adjacent to motorway and inside a lovely business campus. Its much harder to list pros than cons. But overall I'm very much satisfied in my job. My manager is open to suggestions, opinions and to helping me fulfill my own goals.
","-Some managers are there long enough that they're moving their team like political chess pieces with no regard for their interests/passion, pushing them from team to team and project to project as the wind blows. -Formal training is discouraged in many cases unless you're staffed on something else while you do it, because of productivity targets. This will be on a team-by-team basis. -People are punished for working weekends or bank holidays and not taking the days in lieu as money instead because of it's impact on their ""productivity"" -If you're unlucky you'll be stuck doing boring and monotonous services -Relatively flat hierarchy within teams. If you want to expand in your role you might have to convert to another LOB instead of sticking with what you like/are good at due to staffing demands -If your team is full of lone wolves you'll end up re-inventing the wheel multiple times doing things other people have already done. -Pay could be better/subject to mid year review also. Theres times when your roles and responsibilities might increase greatly but your pay is in no way reflecting that change until the annual salary review. -Some management are very apathetic to employee issues(namely pay, job title, roles and responsibilities) -If you're on the wrong team you'll be juiced for every last second of your time, constantly asked on short notice to go onsite, do late-shift backoffice, or any other meaningless task. Cons are very relative alot of the time. If you're on a bad team you're gonna have a bad time. Some teams have loads of travel, some have loads of services, some have loads of late shift. It's kind of a crap shoot sometimes.

A gym has been introduced to the Dublin office and is being touted as a 'pilot' program which will eventually come to Galway - I wont be holding my breath since we barely have enough office space here.
