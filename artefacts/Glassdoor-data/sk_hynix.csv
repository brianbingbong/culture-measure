2013-01-07, Firmware Engineer,"Santa Clara, CA","Current Employee, less than 1 year",Management changing after getting bought by Hynix,"Generally Friendly people to work with in the office, not a lot of politics, it's mostly just work and dealing with clients, if you are in the engineering teams. You can work in any aspect of a project as long as it is something that needs to get done. Free lunch in Hynix building after the office move. Currently still get catered food from random places for dinner.
","Promotions were random, moving people to be project leads when they have no business in being a project manager, only because they wanted a higher salary. Salary is not very competitive. There is only SVN for code management. Code base rarely has comments, making code harder to understand. There are code base where 60-90% were written by 1% of the people in a project. That 1% becomes overworked and is unwilling to explain what they did in the code, slowing down development. There are not enough people that know enough about the code and its fast becoming a game of watching deadlines fly by. If you join, be prepared to read a lot of undocumented and un-commented code and fix it. There is really no training into the architecture and methodology of projects because hardly anything is documented. Management does not seem to understand that the code has to be maintained. If this is not changed, the code will eventually be unmaintainable even with an army of engineers. The other review is correct, you are more likely to be hired if you are Asian because most of the company is Asian, but there are exceptions, but generally you just need to do well and just show that you can think. Things haven't settled down yet from the Hynix buyout so I don't know what is going to happen in the next 6 months.
Advice to Management
Tell the engineers to maintain/explain/comment their code. Internal documentation of code and architecture is a must. Hiring needs to be more diverse.

2012-05-21,,"Santa Clara, CA",Current Employee,Great career growth opportunities in a family-type environment.,"I enjoy working at Link A Media Devices as there is always something to learn with everyone wearing multiple hats. Management truly cares about the workforce and always has an open door policy to addressing any concerns. Compensation is average for the industry and they offer a good benefits package with low employee contribution rates. There is truly a family-type work environment which makes the thought of leaving a challenging one.

Performance reviews are conducted annually alongside merit increases; depending on performance, off-cycle increases are not unheard of. Nightly catered dinners, and flex hours help to mold the start-up feel. If you are looking for career growth and a great work opportunity, this is the place to be.
","Long work hours can hinder a true work/life balance. Expected in a start-up, but can be daunting.
