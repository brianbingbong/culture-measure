They want your time outside of the work day to be YOUR time, so they generally respect the 8-5 or 9-5 time slot and don't expect you to be answering emails after-hours or on the weekend. They try to do lots of social events and maintain a healthy culture. Many people become friends outside of work. For new hires, there's lots of programs to help you engage with other young people and build friendships. They also have mentorship and other training programs so you can learn from leaders and other co-workers with more experience. Most people are very friendly and always willing to help.
","Because of COVID-19, they have suspended their 401k match program as well as their Inspire Recognition monetary rewards, at least for the time being. They also have not even let young, healthy people return to the office with masks and social distancing. Unless you're working directly on hardware, you're working remote. This makes it hard to build relationships, especially as a new hire. The worst part is the introduction of Critical Race Theory to multiple aspects of the company. They have a new required training course this year that pushes far left racial politics. They promote ""How to Be an Antiracist"" by Ibram X. Kendi in the course, and they expect you to acknowledge your ""white privilege"" and fight for the leftist social changes they prescribe. They are also working to revise all of their documents and code to get rid of ""racial/gender language."" Some examples of these words are blacklist, whitelist, man-power and rule of thumb. None of these are discriminatory, yet they expect you to change the English language to fit their political agenda. I do not think I could bring up any of these concerns with my manager without it having a severe effect on my career. This makes me worried about the future of the company.

They are one of the few companies left that does 1:1 matches up to 6% for your 401k. The company is extremely open to remote work, and there are a lot of really great people working here. We are provided professional training every year, and before the pandemic, at least one major conference every year in addition to several smaller, local conferences. The work-life balance is amazing at Dell, and it's a HUGE reason people don't leave, especially those with families/young kids.
","Dell still stack-ranks employees, so inevitably people will get screwed, even if everyone on the team does an equal job. Dell also makes it very hard to get promoted to i9, which is basically the same as a Sr. level anywhere else. But i8s are also considered Sr. anywhere else, and there is a huge difference in the bonus % between i8 (8%) and i9 (15%). Also, Dell doesn't pass out RSUs to everyone like most of the other big tech companies do, so that's a big negative when you're in the tech space. The insurance isn't all that great -- it could definitely be worse, but for a company the size of Dell, you'd expect better insurance/pricing.

","Dell is a large organization in which groups within business orgs frequently encounter political pressures that require a lot of skill and will power as you navigate obstacles. For example, another team may view your work as countering their priorities and thus may rally support against your good work.

","This applies to legacy EMC teams. Everyone is still feeling the effects of the merger than happened 4 years ago. There are so many redundant teams no one knows which sales team to go to for help. The fact that there are so many redundant teams is what has caused the wave of endless layoffs. Internal sales tools are still disparate and the attempted consolidation has only caused more problems. It's painful to have to use 5+ tools to find information that should be found using 1. The portfolio is still too extensive and confusing for customers and it's consolidation has been too slow. This just isn't an interesting industry anymore. New product releases just offer more performance and more storage. The big 3 cloud providers are way more interesting places to work and actually frequently innovate with exciting products. I'd recommend trying to work there instead.

2020-10-08, Senior Technical Support Technician,Domlur,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",Horrible Management,"Cab service was good. Good Security staff. Clean bathrooms. The training staff is one of the best I have seen. Kudos to them. (Sadly you don’t be dealing with them after the training)
","1) The managers keep changing every now and then. And the manager who is appointed is someone who will not stand for the employees and because of which we would be crossed skilled to different teams even though you still report to one manager. This can happen at any time which makes us very uncertain of the job that we would doing when we login. 2) Although you aren’t technically hired for sales they would still expect you to make revenue if you end up in out of warranty team. Now they used to keep us extra benefit if you meet/exceed the revenue target to keep the spirits high but not anymore. So there’s technically no point in making revenue since it’s the management that reaps the benefits. 3) If you are someone who prefers travelling on own vehicle car or bike and are doing a shift that falls between 10am - 9pm then forget the safety of your vehicle. You would end up having more scratches than paint on it. This is partly because they haven’t upgraded the parking and it’s way over crowded. Good luck finding a space to park your vehicle. ALSO YOU WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR PARKING! 4)The top management hides behind the front management (folks that we deal with) to get make sure they meet their numbers while top management would either be gaming or travelling. Yes they do not have a special lobby for managers but they sure as hell know how to pretend to be good in front and squeeze the you for all the work you can physically provide for them. Bottom line please do not get into dell as a Sr technician or jr technician if you care of keeping your self happy.

","In DELL EMC - Professional Services Bangalore office, Leadership is de-motivating and there is dictatorship at it's peak. The Director appointed is a negative individual who micro-manages all the employees and believes in the rumors than reality. He promotes and compensates only those people who are in his favor. He is revengeful to an extent that he manipulates, fabricates and hides the truth and an employee's growth for his own benefit. He lacks vision and puts himself first and the organization's growth second - which is unacceptable.

Pros
Decent job in a world wide job known company. You can get a lot of marketing skills.
Cons
jobs are wrong categorized, people are working in roles irrelevant to titles. Beyond company ethics guideline many employees and managers are behaving unethically beyond the knowledge of finance. Career growth is a big lie unless you're an acquaintance of a manager.

","Despite the lack of typical tech perks, benefits, and compensation, I believe the quality of life at Dell is exceptional. - Healthcare is good, but it’s not totally included ($0) like other big tech. - No free food or drinks. You can easily spend $11 on lunch at HQ. The coffee cafe is not free. I imagine this is because so many people WFH, but it could be subsidized. - No stock. I’ve been told higher levels get stock.

Vertical leadership, there is still a lot of bureaucracy for processes. Not all tools for work are not updated. If changes wants to be made it will take long time to achieve.

","Covid-19 has really shown the true colors of this company, Dell has canceled all benefits due to the pandemic to ""preserve cash."" This has to be one of the dumbest statements I have ever heard after a company goes through 2 quarters of the year with absolutely insane profits, better than ever before. Is the company going to look into changing things like at least 401K matching back, no, nothing is being looked into, just a heartfelt email thanking its employees for making them a ton of money. It might look like the executives are good giving up their salary, but that doesn't even begin to breathe on the money they are actually making in stock options ect. So they are hoarding this money in fear of the recession. News flash, you hoard money, your 150+ thousand employees are no longer spending as much, and the places they went to don't have as much money so they stop spending, and everyone stops spending, places closes and the economy crashes. So thank you Dell for contributing to the economic recession amid making billions in profit so far this year.

2020-07-12, Technical Content Developer,Bangalore,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Perfect place to work, learn, and grow","The best storage company in the world, after acquiring EMC, now they have hardware, software, and solutions. Technical writing team at Dell is huge. The best part here is majority of the managers are best to work with. They don't believe in micromanaged. Every year, all the employees have to take a survey called Tell Dell where they can raise their voice against anything. This process refines the company each year. This survey gets some points for all the managers and there is a limit set whithin which if a manager gets, he/she has to undergo some corrective actions. The engineering team understands the values of Technical doc and really helps. Depending on the managers, most of the teams are flexible. You can work from home. The employer really values employees and their personal life. From May to August, we have summer hours; even Friday second halves are off. You come up with a new idea or process improvements, people always welcome it. A well authoring system in place. You can suggest any modifications. Company encourages applying for other opportunities within the company through IJP. Except the pay (which is not bad) and perk, everything else is the best.
","Pay is not that good. No perks. Yearly hike is also okok. No discount on Dell Product. They sell refurbished laptop, on bidding, and that to on high price. Cretch is free for lady employees only, from an employer like Dell who always believes in equal opportunity, I don't expect this.

My Non-Renewable 2 Years contract will expire then... I wish the manager was honest from the beginning so I could look for a job elsewhere! - Interns don't get to speak up: There's a survey that is sent annually to all staff. I've been working with Dell for a year now but I cannot take the survey because I am an intern (under ANAPEC contract)... I have never felt so belittled in my WHOLE LIFE!!!!

2020-04-24, Financial Analyst ,Bratislava,"Current Employee, less than 1 year",Finance Graduate Program (FGP),"I'm nearly 10 months into the program and looking back can see how much I have gained and grown in this fairly short amount of time as a result of the program. The biggest pro's are: +Lots of new opportunities to develop technical and soft skills. +Accelerates the growth of your professional network. +Program flexibility to your needs for development. +Working with amazing and interesting people. +Interesting time to be a part of the ""Technology Industry"" which is growing exponentially. +Freedom to explore and improvise within the program. +Company Culture Overall I am very pleased with the program thus far, looking forward to what the future holds...
","Overall its a great program for graduates and like all similar finance programs, you'll always find areas that can be improved. It's also very subjective, for me personally the pro's easily outweigh the cons in this program. In addition, if you find any cons the program sponsors/leads are open to listen and make changes accordingly.

2020-04-24,Anonymous,,Current Employee,Finance Graduate Program,"-friendly work environment -opportunity to work outside of the specific role and participate on various events and projects also for other departments -easy networking if you are a person for such thing -support of volunteering activities for community -further education and training courses -mentorship and advice from more senior colleagues -bonus plan framework
","-within the program you are not able to use the full extent of flexibility, which is provided by the company -no ability to rotate to other than finance department, which I think would be really good to get the whole picture about how the company works and improve, simplify and create more effective processes -work/ life balance is more work oriented within the program, because some of the job positions are more demanding, plus there are curricular activities for the program. (But after all, it is a graduate program to help you start your career, so its ok.)

2020-04-21, Program Director,,"Current Employee, less than 1 year",Best move I made,"I was headhunted to work at Dell and I am very glad I took that leap of faith and transitioned to this organisation. Dell are a forward thinking organisation and strive to ensure they move with the demands of the Global and Customer needs, whilst keeping disruption to a minimum. I work in Dell Technologies Select, this area of the business focus's on Transformational Change (IT/Digital/Workplace) for Dells top 100 customers, which means this role has a lot of exposure and interest across the organisation and Account Teams. Despite the size and scale there is a warm family feel about it and people really do look out for and support each other. Despite DT being a huge company you don't feel like a small fish in a big pond. Communication from the Executive Leadership Team is excellent and regular, they want to know what is happening at ground level and encourage feedback and asking questions. As a remote worker I am provided with all the tools I need to execute my role and meet mine and customer objectives. The opportunities within Dell are many and varied, since I've been working for Dell I've spent time working onsite in the US for one of their major customers. Since the world has faced the Covid-19 pandemic Dell has been true to their core values and the level of support they have provided to their employees has been wonderful. I am glad I made the move to Dell.

2020-04-19, Financial Analyst,Bratislava,"Current Employee, less than 1 year",Finance Graduate Program,"Finance Graduate Program is a great start for fresh graduates because it develops you very fast in a very short time with various challenges, occasions. I would list the pros as below: -Being challenged by various projects, competitive analyses, presentations, elevator pitch. You also get some responsibilities require leadership in this very young age. It is very busy schedule, but it was really worth it. -Feedback from manager, program leads, colleagues, sponsors, peers. Therefore, you get a holistic view of yourself, your strengths and your weaknesses. You understand which areas you need to work on. And, you will always find many people ready to help you. You feel supported, not just in words, for real. -Company invests in your development. You feel being valued as an employee. If you like working and development, it is really full of opportunities. -Broad networking opportunity due to program and its events. From Day 1, you are exposed to senior management and executives. -The opportunity to continue from more advanced programs: Finance Development Program, Accounting Development Program, Tax Development Program -You are assigned mentor and you have the opportunity to have regular 1x1 meetings with program sponsors, directors. -Gym in the building is a big plus. -Culture is very positive and supportive. Positivity starts spreading from leadership, firstly from Michael Dell :)
","-Besides the program activities, not every FGPs' individual role is the same. Everybody is assigned to different roles and role is taking most of the time. The work load of the roles can be closer to each other than now. -The program is normally designed for 1 year. However, there is an opportunity to continue from more advanced program after 6 moths. Although this is beneficial because it brings a huge motivation, sometimes the group focuses on this more than it is needed.

I have been into the system for less than a year, and I was already threatened to take away the job if I don’t do things according to manager(which was playing a part in his blame games). 4. Threat to ruin your career were also few things that happened.

","Ooh! What an awful slice of dated corporate hell this place is! I came in as a University Hire to the sales department, only once there, they had no positions to fill (after lying to us that they did for months), so after hooking us with a signing bonus, they put us doing cold calls 40 hours a week, with no chance at bonuses/commission or advancement. The SWAT sales people not in the University program get the same treatment, only no benefits and $15/hr. One guy had been there 10 months at this rate as they kept stringing him along to becoming a permanent employee, with no end in sight. ""Culture"" is a word used solely to discriminate against those who are unsatisfactory -- be it due to race, sexual orientation, age, or general intelligence/business sense. Qualifications and experience mean nothing in favor of a low-cut blouse during the forced ""mentoring"" sessions with the piggish (nearly all) male managers. As for the bonus structure, Google ""Dell fraud"" and you'll find the company has violated tax laws and misreported it's numbers for TEN QUARTERS STRAIGHT! The ""numbers"" they pay you on and expect you to hit are complete and absolute fiction. Avoid this place. The only people who succeed there are the ones who wouldn't anywhere else, which is why everyone you meet used to a be a ""shopgirl"" or ""waiter"" until working here. The (likely to be broken promise of) benefits got them hypnotized. This is not a good place to work for anyone with any actual earning potential. Since leaving, several hiring managers told me it was a good thing I left and it's actually a mark against you to have Dell on your resume in the tech world, as they have a reputation for not being able to fit in anywhere else. That fits, and since entering a position with decent management/transparency, I see what a truly negative and incompetently run experience this job truly was.

Benefits and programs are wonderful. Coworkers and Management all work as a Team. Dell invests heavily in training and making sure you have the skills and tools to do your job. Best onboarding experience I have ever had.

2020-01-29, Senior Financial Advisor,Bangalore,"Current Employee, more than 8 years","I am working in Dell for 7.5 years now, Joined just after my B.Tech. as a DB tester then B.A. now Senior Finance Advisor","1. Salary is better compared to market standards. 2. Dell offers employees the chance to explore your career as per your interest. 3. Immense opportunity to train yourself from the huge library of training materials available. 4. Unethical practices are identified and punished. HR and Ethics team make it one of the best organization to work in. 5. Diversity at its finest. Dell gives chance to work in a global environment. 6. If you end up being in a team where the leader is not supportive of you or the entire team altogether, there is an opportunity to send individual feedback about your leader/s to an annual survey, conducted by 3rd Part Vendor. Serious actions are taken by the organization if the result of the survey indicates poor behavior from the leadership towards the team. So, unlike many other companies , here in Dell, leadership is serious about employee welfare.
","1. Seat allocation system in Dell Bangalore is one of the worst and a process driven by EGO of the Dell Bangalore Facility Management . Dell does not have enough number of seats to allocate to all employees in Bangalore. There is no centralized portal/process for seat allocation. So, it depends on how good relationship your management have with the Bangalore Facilities higher management. Mostly it takes long time (sometime few years) for a new member to get allocated seats. So, privacy at work is a challenge. 2. The process of quantifying a non-sales employees contribution to organizational Goal is completely dependent on human(Manager) judgement. So, if a manager has personal grudge to one of the resource in the team, then that particular resource end up getting bad annual hike no matter how much contribution that person has given towards achieving organizational goal.

Not every day is roses, but to work for a company who is as focused in innovation and success as Dell is, allows everyone to be focused on the same goals. Most of Dell works remote 100% or at least 50%, this has made a huge impact on my work/life balance. I am able to work remotely at least 2-3 days a week. Excellent health and wellness benefits.
","I've heard from others that it's too big of a company/people get lost in the largeness. I think you chose your own adventure. If you want to be seen, make sure you are in front of leadership. Let your manager know that you are interested in other areas to grow in.

(And I have worked at other global technology company's). Benefits are generous. Company vision and strategy are solid. With the Dell Technologies company being an umbrella for several companies, there are lots of opportunities and paths for those who are career driven. My territory has really great senior management. The culture is very much on the side of business professional which I like. I have worked at another global tech company where the culture was more ""hipster"" and ""disruptive: in their attitude and approaches and Dell Technologies definitely is not that. This could be seen as a pro or con for some, I have just found that the business professional approach is more successful for an organisation in their marketplace.
","Internal systems for doing your job are fragmented and unorganized. It took me over three months to get full access to systems I need to do my job. The Dell and EMC systems are not integrated yet. Processes in general take a while and can be kludge. Vacation time was something I could not negotiate coming here as part of my package. I have had four weeks of vacation for about ten years now and Dell Technologies starts everyone out with three weeks and they really emphasize that their week of shutdown during the week of Christmas is like having a fourth week of vacation. This may be OK for some, but for others like myself, I do not like being forced to use time off, especially during the week of Christmas which means traveling for personal time is less likely.

EMC management wears as a badge of honor, how little vacation they take and expect you to do the same. If you are taking vacation you don't work hard. If you have to take vacation, take your phone and laptop with you. It's a ""if your're not in the office to be seen you're not working"" culture.

","- A serious overload in admin which gets in the way of KPI’s. This is due to excruciating ‘red tape’ approach to all operations. - This overload means you’ll either have to do long hours, ignore certain customers or fall behind with KPI’s... - Rather large targets - A couple of people in management who don’t adhere to what Dell stands for - which is integrity, remote workplace and positivity. - Silly meetings that could be in an email.

Dell on paper is a great company to work for. In real life, the culture is truly awful. I’m not talking about there are a few bad apples. 98% of the people I met and worked with on a daily basis were not team players, rude, miserable in their jobs and complained constantly about the job, Dell, etc. There is such poor communication from management that no one is ever on the same page and teams are constantly at odds. This shows to our customers who have a bad option of Dell because of this confusing and frustrating lack of communication.

Nothing will happen after that. - Managers overcommit with their superiors and then pressurize team member to deliver. - Can call person anytime to reply US mails. - No transparency in the process. - No one will take responsibility to give KT to new members. The intention would be just to save their positions by creating dependency. - Will feel biased environment within the team. Privileges for one member will be indiscipline for others. - Leads and Managers will suppress your idea with demotivating comments. - If you are planning for any certification or course then ready for a ton of questions.

What makes it worse, I have to clean up the promoted person's mess and it's clear the person has no business being a manager per peers and others within our Business Unit. I have been told by some peers that I should address this with HR, but I never wanted to be that GUY. By the way, this also happened one of my peers, guess what we had in common?!

","- immense workload. work life balance is a myth. - ""flexible"" working hours in bad way as in employees will certainly always, bring their work home due to the heavy workload. - job scope can defer alot from the advertised position - middle and lower management can be very frustrating to deal with their lack of foresight and frequent changes in management direction leading to disruptive changes that do not bring value.

2019-09-11, Account Manager: Global Client and Compute Solutions,"Nashville, TN","Current Employee, less than 1 year",Dell Technologies Review - specific towards GCCS,"When applying for jobs, I applied to more than most (upward 150 applications towards different jobs). With this being said, I was blessed enough to have multiple job offers. So why Dell? Personally, Dell stood out. The position, the culture, the pay, the benefits, the work/life balance, the people... it felt too good to be true. From day one, Dell as a company and the people that it employees have been nothing but welcoming to me. They have included me in and out of the office. They have helped me with any questions that I have had and done so with an amazing attitude. They have given me resources throughout Dell to help me get involved in other areas. For example, my manager knew that I loved to party plan and told me about our group ""Winning Culture"" that plans all of Dell's events. I joined the group and have loved every second of it. They have encouraged me, challenged me, and are helping to shape me into the business woman that I'm becoming. The people here GENUINELY care about you. There is so much room to grow and change positions throughout the company. If you accept a sales job here and realize sales isn't for you, no problem. Dell is completely comfortable and actually encourages their employees to bounce around throughout the company to discover what they really love. There is so much opportunity for horizontal (moving from one position to another in a different area of the company) and vertical promotions (moving from one position to a higher position in the same area of the company). I have absolutely nothing but great things to say about this place. As a recent college graduate and this being my first job, I know that doesn't really qualify me to know much about the workforce, but as far as I know, there is no place like Dell. If you ever get the opportunity to work for this company, please do yourself a favor and accept the job.

","Micro management. They would rather replace you with a kid straight out of college then pay you the higher level you earned. They provide cake quotas to newbies to prevent turnover while pushing tenured reps out the door with unattainable quotas. Truth is I made $25k more when I started as 2 levels below what I am now because management buried me in quota as I moved up. Upper management puts metrics on the reps that they have no clue of effect or backing to prove. If a team is leading in sales revenue, but lowest on call numbers they catch all holy hell that they need to make calls because that executive NEEDS to prove the calls metric leads to the sales they preached it would. If the forced metrics don’t meet what they preached it’s their job on the line so they threaten to make sure the numbers meet what they say works. You never know how your quota is created or given a fair and accurate picture of how it was. Management can load quota on different team members at their discretion. Somehow you grow your accounts 20% after a 12% quota increase, but you miss your quota by 25% match doesn’t add up... Management blocks upward movement if they don’t have heads to fill your current role. If you can get out of the sales seat and into a different role the company is amazing and job security increases 90%. Sales reps are expendable and not appreciated.

Organization is handicapped by own legacy internal systems that interfere with your ability to get your job done quickly and accurately.

The Dell employee discount is generous and funded two computers and a television while I was employed there. Training is generous and, at least while I was there, vouchers for certification exams were fairly easy to get, but only for Dell/EMC certifications unless you had a manager willing to do the extra work for, say, an AWS voucher. Work/Life balance largely depended on your client, not Dell. Dell by itself was pretty lenient about working from home as required, so long as you did not abuse the privilege.
","Being swallowed up by a much larger company squashed the career mobility of former EMC employees flat once the dust had settled.

Pros
Offers great flexibility for timing away during the working day Good benefits
Cons
The Co. is very cost-focused. Moving 90% of back-office work to an overseas location which impacts employee morale. The idea is to leave only hand full of roles in U.S. rest move to the cost-effective location. However, they are increasing more and more directors and VPs. So I am puzzled understanding the companies end goal. They promote employees to do doubt about it. However, the way they promote employees is little award. They make you work like a dog for the next level and once you are already maxed out for that next level then they move you that role.

I have raised a ticket stating the importance of having a warmer environment, but the office is cold every single day. Another thing that I see is the integration between Dell and EMC.

I think that the company has come a long way in terms of its approach to and investment in innovation that will pay off for years to come. Although it's been said here many times, it's hard to beat a good work-life balance where you get to enjoy your vacation and have the opportunity to work remotely.

2019-06-04, Senior Advisor,,"Current Employee, less than 1 year","Fantastic culture, with ample opportunity to grow and learn","Fantastic benefits, culture, and people. I've never interviewed at a company where people walk by and smile and say hello to a total stranger. I know that sounds like a small thing, but I think it goes to show you how happy people are that work here. It's extremely flexible in terms of work/ life balance. Management understands that everyone is an adult and that you can manage your own schedule - there is automatic trust that if you made it through the interview process, you can handle your day-to-day tasks. I love the 401k match, wellness options, and didn't opt into the health plan but have heard wonderful things. I will say that post-merger, it seems like the dynamic is changing - I am a fairly new employee, but my initial impressions of Dell being a slower, seasoned, traditional company are quickly falling to the wayside. People move fast and nimble here. I really love that, coupled with the flexibility.
","It's a large company, so if you're not used to rolling up your sleeves to get a question or issue addressed, this may not be the company for you. You have to sometimes dig and ask around a few times to get answers (which I enjoy, but not for everyone)

","- 80% of the work is done by 20% of the people - Upper level executives are absolutely clueless and assign resources to teams that are better at marketing vs. teams that are actually solving engineering problems - Pay is below average - The environment is more or less an anything goes type environment.

I've seen things like managers making jokes about women's appearances, making fun of people because of their religion or age, and much more.

Relaxed sales environment. Very lax attitude towards hitting targets and KPI's.
","Worst paying tech sales job in the whole of Dublin. I'm not exaggerating. Over half a decade there and my salary was worse than entry paying sales jobs in companies like Salesforce. Very little in the way of promotions, and salary increase. Horrific tools to do your job. I'll probably have nightmares about gii for years to come. CRM is a joke. So much rubbish and duplications that end up in internal fights with other departments and countries over account ownership. If you're too lazy to clean up the CRM yourself, at least outsource it to someone who can!!! Managers and above not interested in helping you develop your career at all. Actually, this is unfair, there are a few gems in this company, but as a collective, the drive is just not there. No free coffee or tea (petty complaint, but come on.. this is standard in nearly every office in Dublin). Canteen is really... not great. Revolving door of graduates. They constantly hire them because they're a cheap source of labour. While the company's founder has listed what the companies Values are on the website, there's absolutely no sense of follow through with them. Nobody cares. The only time they come up as a vague topic is during the dreaded annual ethics exam. Winning with integrity?? Yeah right. I've seen countless salespeople act and win business in unscrupulous ways many MANY times in Dell.

","- paperwork non-technical managers in highly technical engineering roles : You're on your own depending on team placement. - no mentorship programs / new-hire-integration plans for technical roles. Newly hired employees must find their own space and push their own needs forward. - work culture is partially locked in Waterfall, lots of old ideas from old-timers - endless bureaucracy and ""not my job"" attitudes baked into the work-culture (work hard play hard) - work schedule is not flexible as other employers, importance is placed on being visible and physically present at all times - take note if you have kids or family to attend to. Work from home is allowed typically once per month, but varies team to team. - dividing line between employees and managers, at times there is emphasis placed on one being above the other - we are not considered equals when it comes to asking for time to discuss project direction, team contributions, company objectives etc - very much focused on top-down employee direction

Pros
Benefits are great. Bonus structure is great, ranges from 8% to 15% to 25% (directors) to 40% for VPs and upwards... 401K is 6% match. Very good WFH solutions across the company, but that means early morning calls and late night calls to support global activities. Very solid in terms of business vision.
Cons
The leadership is very old white men's club. Even though they keep touting women in leadership , in reality, majority leaders by far are men, white and old timers. Very less chance for younger folks to go up the ladder. They are extremely cheap in terms of spending on ""fun"" stuff. E.g. no free coffee, no good offsite, no free stuff for employees. They only pay for customer engagement programs.

","-Detached leadership -Unethical sales practices are celebrated -Quotas are dependent on other people The middle management is dangerously political with an unclear vision that directly impacts the morale of the floor. Since I've worked there, the culture has deteriorated. Quotas can be determined by favoritism. They are overhiring and the quality of hires have been declining.

","Because so many people in my function have been with Dell for years, there is a lot taken for granted. Probably not unique to Dell; still, as a new hire, it's tough. It's like pulling teeth to get information and guidance, and I'm just referring to within my own team! Bit of bait and switch with my job - I was hired for my skills and experience in one area, and now I'm doing something quite different. Had I known then what I know now, I likely would have removed myself from the staffing process. I'm reasonably autonomous, but feel like I've been left to sink or swim in many ways. Conflict avoidant manager, so I'm having to figure out a lot on my own. I've had a number of payroll related issues, which leaves a terrible impression as a new hire. I'm a salaried exempt employee, been around since January, and my pay still isn't quite right. If I didn't need the benefits, I'd probably have resigned already. If I'm still around in 6-12 months, perhaps I'll feel differently.

","- Cost reduction is being applied to the maximum since the EMC merge. EMC was a really great place to work because the company focused A LOT about its people and invested in them so much whether in trainings or recognitions. However now Dell is changing all that gradually hoping no one will notice. Now their only focus is on numbers. - Trainings have been cut to the very minimum and almost all trainings are not approved now. - Recognition system has changed only to decrease the amount of money spent on it. it's been cut to almost 70%. - Even the annual raise percentages became a joke, really. They decreased the percentages and their reasons are beyond nonsense. Travel incentive has been changed and now they don't give you an incentive in your pocket but would just allow you to redeem 80-100 euros per day on food and transportation. So they stopped giving fixed pocket money as they did before. - Overall the culture changed. Even those they choose for management positions are no longer people-managers. They choose pure numbers-oriented managers. Turnovers have reached its maximum since EMC opened in Egypt. Everything changed and is going to change even more. - I never thought of wanting to ever leave the company when it was EMC but now, I would leave on first offer.

","If you want a company that will work you to death, gives zero appreciation, small raises, and treat you terribly, this is the place for you. Virtustream is all over the place, they have way too much management and throw out senior director to anyone as long as they are completely incompetent and don't understand the product or operations at all. Public sector is an absolute train wreck and nightmare, upper management gives it no attention and the testing for the products that will run there are practically zero. The business tries to focus its talent and time into things that customers aren't asking for, they don't listen to you, and operations is horrendously anemic. Another main issue is that the company basically encourages bad employees, you work like crazy and another employee does almost nothing - good work team, carry on. You work an entire weekend, up till 4 am on Saturday, good job, pat on the back. 80 hours of work in a week might occasionally get you a $100 ""reward"" for you efforts, enjoy your $2 an hour of overtime. The company basically treats its employees terribly, my family has had to have an intervention with me. A previous coworker I worked with had a similar experience and was encouraged to quit for her health from being so stressed and exhausted.

2019-01-08, Principal Software Engineer,"Round Rock, TX","Former Employee, more than 3 years",Great place to work and have a good work/life balance. Not the most challenging place though.,"I worked in the server division as a firmware engineer. My management was great, hands-off, and very strongly supported their team members. The work/life balance was awesome in that management allowed you to have your own work style, hours, etc.. There were some very smart people here that are experts in their respective subject matters from whom you can learn a lot. There is a lot of career advancement possibilities here since there are many engineering titles. You definitely get recognized for your work if you make it visible and you will get rewarded for it. Personally, I was very happy with the team environment and the confidence of management to allow their engineers to make his/her own decisions.
","There are lot of people with a cruising mentality here. The bar for entry isn't the highest so you won't be surrounded by really smart people. The work is interesting and challenging at first but being a server company, you're not really working on the most cutting edge things. I'd classify Dell as a reactive company vs. an innovations company. There's not a lot of money is invested in R&D. I feel like while engineering has a big presence, the focus is more on making money in sales and marketing. I just didn't feel challenged enough and wasn't fulfilled with the problems that I was solving. There's not as many perks as compared to the tier 1 companies.

2018-12-30,,,Former Employee,Good if you are ok working autonomously then a ton of feedback,"Autonomy, collaboration, decent pay, work from home, latitude to make some decisions without a committee, creative outlet.
","Whikle automony was expected, review cycles did not come, even though people reviewing the content had seen the progress - positioning, messaging, concepts - along the cycle. Many time there was no a lot of time to incorporate feedback and back flips ensued to get things done prior to launch in a GTM setting. While doing the work leading up to the launch of a product/service/software, executives were regularly updated on messages, positioning, content, deliverables, etc. HOWEVER, not all execs. attended the meetings, there were too many people with input power and a thousand requests for inclusion of other offerings on the products that were sure to get attention. So it was a tough balancing act. It wasn't until everything - especially a press release where all the aforementioned information was on two pages, was there a visceral reaction. So then come the back flips - to hurry up an change any of the above where translations were already done and paid for...and would have to wait a quarter. Also, sometimes when you had the decision, there were internal fights over the decisions and groups, like development would hold the schedule hostage until one bent to their way of seeing things. HOURS WASTED. Finally, in all the cost cutting that went on, many groups would layoff or reassign people in an organization - let's say Online (responsible for the process and general design of webpages) - to show they were within their target cos-cutting. It looks great on paper, BUT the jobs that were vacated generally rolled up to the marketing manager who already had their hands full with photography, videos, content, brochures, aligning organizations, staying within brand guidelines, coordinating with the communications team, providing feedback on press relases, often time representing Dell at events or press briefings and getting all that coordinated by specific dates for translations, legal review and ultimately launch dates. So then there would be more added to the plate in addition to all the reviews with executives.

2018-09-27, Software Engineer,"Austin, TX","Current Employee, more than 3 years",Software Engineer,"The salary and benefits are pretty good. There's also an actually decent focus on work/life balance. Aside from the occasional long hours before/during a release to production most people pretty much keep it to 40 hours/week. Most people also have flexibility to work from home at least part of the time.
","To put it nicely, on the whole I would say that Dell (or at least the engineering space) is a giant, inefficient, incredibly frustrating organizational mess. When the company went private several years ago a good chunk of the best engineering talent either quit or were laid off. Since then the direction from management seems to have been to outsource about 2/3 of all team members to India and to never get rid of under-performing employees. So over time as many of the great engineers are promoted up or leave the company out of frustration we've seen a steady degradation of overall quality on software teams. There's also a frustrating amount of red tape to go through for every little thing. Want to deploy a bug fix to a test environment that will unblock several downstream teams for next week's release? Gotta wait until the end of the day when deployments are unlocked for 2 hours or else get a email sign-offs from 5 managers who don't know anything about your project, several of which may be asleep on the other side of the world. Lastly, over the years I've seen management change hands and departments renamed so many times that I literally don't even pay attention anymore if it doesn't directly impact my team. And especially when upper management is changing around, there's a good chance somebody somewhere is getting laid off. Makes people nervous. So to kind of sum up my pros and cons here, if you want a relatively stable job with good pay and benefits, decent work/life balance and flexible hours, and you don't mind dealing with a whole lot of frustrating nonsense tangential to your actual work then Dell might be a good fit. But if you're a real go-getter and want an exciting environment to work in then I'd suggest looking elsewhere.

","Executive leadership at Dell is extremely frustrating. They make top down decisions about everything and leave managers constantly struggling to explain and keep up with changes (with zero employee or local management feedback). The only issue with their healthcare package is for married couples, where the spouse has a full time job at another company. Dell EMC actually penalizes these employees, basically making it more affordable to just drop your spouses Dell EMC coverage. One frustrating thing at Dell EMC is employee growth opportunities. They constantly have an extremely high turn over rate because people find it easier to leave and come back in order to get more money and/or promotions. And the final thing that was most frustrating to me personally with Dell (not EMC), was the employee purchase program for Dell products. They provide an annual 17% discount, which is nice, but that 17% is based on the retail price of the products. They would really increase their own employee purchasing and using their own brand if they provide a better program where employees could purchase Dell equipment for around cost.

","The technical sales rep job is a literal nightmare. I came to Dell for the vast opportunities it boasted. Unfortunately...those's opportunities are seemingly at the very end of a long, dark tunnel. During the interview, I was very hesitant about the sales position. I had read pages of pros and cons regarding Dell and addressed them in the interview. I was told those reviewers were liars. Still, against my better judgement, accepted the position as I was told, ""if you end up not liking the sales position there are thousands of other positions!"" The 9 weeks of training were very informative, fun, and filled with the Dell koolaide but didn't shed a ton of light on the day to day of the job, which now I understand why. If you enjoy: micromanagement being told you'll lose your job if you don't make the sale cold calling people begging for their business Being lied to about your commissions Weekly change of your quota and metrics then this job is perfect for you. I find myself either bored to tears or stressed to tears with no in-between. The turnover here is incredibly high. I've already started prospecting for another job. Why you ask since there are so many opportunities? HA well, you are forced to stay in your position for 18 months and it's virtually impossible to move out of the sales rolls as all these ridiculous metrics they put on you are impossible to obtain. AWESOME. Also beware....when you do decide to look for another job, if you leave Dell within 2 years you have to pay them back your supposed 3 month guarantee of $5,000 (another thing they boast in the onboarding that doesn't exist) This place is sketchy, corrupt, and a living anxiety attack. Seriously - do your research. really think about it before you sign the papers. there are so many better opportunities out there.

2018-09-15, Senior Director Engineering,"Santa Clara, CA","Former Employee, more than 1 year",The most Toxic company in the valley,"Nothing I can think of.
","Where to start? Politics – Totally passive aggressive. Everyone is pretending to be your friend all the while they are trying to stab you in the back to get ahead. Head of departments avoid confrontation at all costs. How do you rise to a VP or SVP without dealing with confrontation? Lying is expected and encouraged here. This gets funny because they forget which lie they tell to who and routinely get caught and laugh it off. They won’t outright fire someone, scared to so they pick at people until they’ve had enough and quit. Collective IQ – This is the dumbest company I’ve ever worked for, they give new meaning to the Peter Principle. Now don’t get me wrong, there are smart people here but on a whole, the smart people can’t raise the collective IQ. Everyone is waiting for their green card to exit this company. Petty – Had to go over to see it myself. They have management in another building that counts disposable cups and complains that too many are being used. They have posted signs on the coffee machine that only people that work in his group or visitors can have drinks or snacks. Benefits – Worst benefits in the valley, full stop, real third world stuff. They had a “Tell Dell” survey last year and benefits came out as something major for the company. In the end the only change they made was reducing the company matching 401K and benefits stayed the same. When I started, I had to bring in proof that my kids were indeed mine. People having to pay out of pocket for routine test that at every other company I’ve work at were covered, things like blood tests, x-rays etc. are not covered. Don’t get me started on their “health screening and wellness”, employees signed their health history away for ~$600 or two months out of paycheck contribution, now they have people’s health history, god knows what they’re planning to do with it. BTW, if you’re a fan of drug testing, then Dell has something waiting for you. IT – Absolutely nothing works, their systems, their laptops and/or desktops. They force an operating system that resembles Windows and everything is locked down, access to outside internet resources, applications, everything, still didn’t stop wide spread virus problems from hitting the company. Their hardware is the worst, someone in another builds laptop almost started on fire in his bag on the way home. Machines routinely reboot for no reason and ports are disabled. They have an application for every function. There are literally hundreds of applications that you have to use for PTO, Benefits etc. and most only work through IE6. You have to get permission to have admin rights on your machine but still can’t do anything. They made a change to accessing email, forcing everyone to windows and outlook, this left the Linux engineering community out in the cold. All meetings run through Skype which barely works. It normally takes 5 – 10 minutes to get a meeting started because of Skype issues. Travel – There isn’t a published process on travel other than to be cheap (except if you’re an executive). I know someone that had a medical issue that had to travel and after a doctor’s excuse and weeks of process hurtles, they got a dispensation to travel in business internationality. This was scrutinized by management and called into question every time they were required to travel. Reports on “exceptions” are reviewed by the division heads quarterly and you don’t want to be on that report. Tell Dell – They tell you that the internal survey is anonymous, yet you have to put in your userid. You give them honest feedback and they know where it came from. HR here for their own good. The have HR reps for every function and they are all over the country. The routinely skip the people they are working for, manufacture problems and go to the division heads so they can look good. One of the heads of HR would not meet with employees until they submitted questions in writing. When they didn’t get enough, the person cancelled meeting with employees because he was afraid of what they might ask him. Have and Have nots: Sr directors and above get perks, travel in business, paid phones, special laptops and other perks setting up a class system in the company. And just in case, micro management is also king here, to get an expense report or anything completed it needs to involve at least 4 – 5 layers of management reminiscent of a 1950’s manufacturing culture. Bottomline here – I could go on but let’s leave it at, this is the most toxic company I’ve ever seen in the valley.

Personally, I have found that initiative and hard work is rewarded and recognition is regular. There are financial rewards available for stand-out contributions as well. DellEMC has a great entry level program with good starting pay for new Technical Support Engineers. Emphasis on mentorship and coaching for new-ish (up to years in some departments) is one of the most positive aspects of building a career at Dell.
","EMC seems to lag a good way behind the market in pay and it's not improved after Dell bought EMC => DellEMC now. I wouldn't call it bad, but workplace perks and efforts to raise employee morale/satisfaction isn't on the same level as most of the surrounding peer companies, including the large tech corporations in the area. Unfortunately, Dell (including DellEMC) does seem to be the type of big tech corporation that only compensates you fairly as you enter the company and doesn't do much to identify and hold on to superior employees. It's pretty standard that TSEs in these kinds of companies only stay for 2-3 years before they're being paid well under market value and move to another company to make any real progress (think 3%/year if you stay vs. staying 2-3 years then moving to another company with a 20% raise... even moving back a couple of years later for matching pay if you want).

Cons

2018-08-21, Senior Engineer,"Hopkinton, MA","Current Employee, more than 10 years",A Modern Day Sweatshop!,"It is employment, kinda sorta.
","The stories you’ve heard are true, it’s a modern day sweatshop. They are hopelessly understaffed, and intentionally so, because it saves them money. They will heap a simply impossible amount of work upon you. You will find yourself spending your entire workday wandering from pointless meeting to pointless meeting. During each conference, you will have several hours of work assigned to you, with no time to actually perform the assigned tasks. At the end of the day, management will simply tell you to “get it done for tomorrow”. The implication being that you’re supposed to get out of work, and then go back to work - from home during the evening. I regularly get email from my coworkers around 3:00 AM because they’re still up at that hour doing the work that they were assigned during the day. They come in to work exhausted the next morning, looking like death warmed over, because they were up working all night and got no sleep. It is common for management to dump 20+ hours of work onto your lap at 4:00 PM on Friday afternoon and order you to have it completed for Monday morning - so much for your weekend. Needless to say, there will be no time for vacations. Just work, work, and more work. What kind of a life is this? I’ve seen young kids in their early 20’s need to be on medication just so they can cope with their jobs. It will eventually catch up to you and make you sick. When that happens, you become a liability. It would expose the company to further liability if they were to terminate you because they made you sick, so instead they will try to torture you into quitting on your own. They will double down when you are on the verge of collapsing and heap even more work upon you. They will write falsely negative performance reviews and otherwise make you so miserable that you just can’t stand it anymore. If you refuse to quit, you will simply be eliminated in their next round of contrived layoffs, which are pretty much constantly ongoing. Then they will bring in a fresh piece of meat to replace you and work them to death next. I have never seen such an incredible rate of turnover. They should install a revolving door on the front of the building, oh wait, they did! Seriously, the rate of sickness and heart attacks is shocking, several people have even died. It all boils down to one word: EXPLOITATION. Maximum exploitation of everything and everyone that they come into contact with. I have never seen such a Marxist commodification of human beings. During my orientation, the HR rep actually said “We are the Borg. You will be assimilated. Resistance is futile.” (look up the science fiction reference if you’re not familiar with Star Trek). They went on to tell us that “EMC stands for ‘Eventually Marriage Counseling’ because of all the long hours that we are going to make you work”. They might as well say “welcome to the company, we’re going to ruin your marriage”. Honestly, they actually said these things to us during our orientation! They expect you to put the company before all else in your life. It is supposed to come before your home, your family, your relationships, your happiness and even your health. This loyalty and dedication will not be returned though, in fact, they will screw you in a heartbeat if it saves them a nickel. Virtue is a vice at this place and they are an inhuman calculating machine that operates completely without a conscience. Their employees mean absolutely nothing to them and “corporate ethics” truly is a contradiction in terms here. There is a striking lack of policy regarding the treatment of workers, and a striking lack of enforcement for what little policy there is. They will berate you, humiliate you, belittle you, insult you and torture you. Coercion is basically the only form of motivation that they know. If your manager wants to put a gun to your head in order to extract an additional 3% output, well that’s just fine with the executives – in fact, it’s commendable. They basically let managers do whatever they want. And you know what they say about absolute power… HR is complicit in the corruption. When management wants to screw you, it is HR’s function to basically “grease the skids” and see that it is done in such a way that does not expose the company to liability. They are experts in re-writing history, deception, underhanded behavior, dishonesty and getting around the law. It's like something out of the dark ages. You are not going to get a chance to tell your side of the story, you will simply be ambushed on your way into work on some random day. It’s every dirty trick in the book, and several more that they have invented on their own. Every argument is one-sided and they’ve basically discovered that dictatorship is a very efficient form of government. As a condition of being hired, you are forced to sign the most onerous and draconian document that I have ever seen. It includes such conditions as allowing the company to access your private email accounts and waiving your right to sue. That’s right, you must give up your 7th Amendment rights and agree to resolve any disputes through their arbitration process. I can just imagine what kind of justice you will get from the company court. Just why do you think they’re doing this? Every relationship is adversarial, rather than cooperative. Management against workers, groups against other groups, workers against each other. Once management realizes that you don’t trust them anymore, they will approach you through someone that you do trust (usually a colleague) and screw you through them. You will eventually arrive at the accurate conclusion that you can’t trust anyone. This culture is completely toxic, but they ridiculously try to sell it as “excellence”. Incompetent people are constantly promoted to senior level positions, while exceptional workers are trapped in menial jobs. It gets to the point where titles don’t mean anything at all. They would much rather hire cheap workers than talented ones. They especially prefer foreigners or young kids who can be tricked into performing multiple people’s jobs and working 80 hours per week for low pay. Key contributors are regularly eliminated because management basically figures that they have already extracted most of what they’re going to get out of them. Politics is king and the old boy network truly runs the place. Working here is like being trapped in a spider’s web: the more you try to struggle, the more entangled you'll become, and it will eventually kill you. Ultimately, it’s just best to stay away from this place.

They dont know much about R&D, just assembling stuff they buy from other companies. They dont put resources where they need to be to succeed and seem very happy with being ‘competitive’. EMC wanted to be the best. Nobody seems to have a good plan but they sure want you to clap and yell ‘hooray’ when they announce a slight drop in excellence.

","They are literally working people to the point of sickness and death. Had to attend my coworker's funeral after he died of a heart attack brought on by work related stress at the young age of 38. He left a wife and children behind. Know of several others that died under similar circumstances here. The ambulance carries people out of this meat grinder on a regular basis. Almost funny when the rescue truck parks directly under their ""Great Place To Work"" banner (it should read: ""Arbeit Macht Frei""). Their regular and unjustified layoffs are used as purges to eliminate those who can't be legally terminated. Once they make you sick, they see you as a liability to them and you will be ambushed at the next layoff, which is never very far away. In a blatant effort to remove anonymity from their employee satisfaction survey, management actually exported a copy of the survey onto an external website and forced us all to take it there, before submitting the real one - just so they knew exactly who said what about them. Imagine this: people are literally dropping dead around you and you're supposed to say what a wonderful job management is doing, or you will be laid off. Never have gotten a raise and have never even been paid my full salary in all the years I've been here. You will be forced to carry the workload of 6 or 8 different positions combined into one job. Everyone here is miserable and management has got ""railroading"" innocent people down to a science. Backstabbing, incompetence, corruption and politics are all rampant. The best thing you can do at this place is to leave. Haven't seen people treated this way outside of a concentration camp!

","Age old technology. Senior engineers take decisions on how APIs should look and junior engineers code it out. This model is so flawed that nobody takes complete responsibility for a component. Those who design APIs keep reworking because they lack the insights into implementation details and those who fill in the APIs have little idea of how it applies across components. Legal team is a big let down and yet the company supports it with max trust. They have messed up so many of the employees through faulty applications, untimely filings, illogical suggestions, and so on. They are totally incompetent and they walk unchecked, unaccountable for any glorious blunders that they do. I have personally seen more than a dozen of my H1B colleagues leave this organization just for immigration purposes. More are in line!! My advice: If you are on H1B, stay away from this place. Being in bay-area and not have RSUs is like the biggest joke. Once Dell took over EMC, all RSUs were taken away and most of us are left with 50% of TC. Only a small fraction of employees are getting long-term incentives and that's been thrown like biscuits to dogs in the range of 5K-10K for 4 years vesting. Even people at VP level discuss on issues as small as why this API is looking this way and managers hold meetings all day to go through gory details of several components without having a clue of what they do and how they perform. Managers are zero quipped with technical ability and yet they work day and night on technical decisions. By the way, this cry is all about DataDomain.

Yes, accept that and you could have a good time!!","Good number of leaves (20 vacations, 10 public holidays, 12 sick leaves, 12 casual leaves) with leave encashment. Good technology in the teams I know. Could turn in to a retail and enterprise hardware-software giant if the management's vision works out. Opportunity to move around in the company through internal job movement every 18 months. Helps you build exposure to different teams, products while providing a good hike. You will need to go through interviews again for the new role. EMC is Market Leader in its domain. EMC is Known brand in market. Dell is a known brand in homes too. Work life balance is very good in my team. Good managers who treat you fairly with respect in my team.
","I was part of EMC which was acquired by Dell. Many employee friendly policies from EMC has been removed. For example - insurance cover (reduced cover, added copay, removed parents cover), advance loans, higher study programs, variable pay payout times - all removed. Feels like our benefits have been taken away. Cost cutting everywhere to pay for the huge loans Dell had to take to pay for EMC. Effects almost all areas including team outings, travel, goodies. One of the worst performance and appraisal cycles I have seen. Performance cycle is Jan to Dec. Appraisal happens in OCT next year. i.e, 10 months after performance cycle ends. Neutral feeling on the way goals and inputs are captured. Rarely see HR around. EMC is being brought in to Dell culture - way of working, policies, pay and benefits etc. Working style, software development methodology etc followed in my team was much better than the current Dell way of doing things which we are being asked to follow. It is still good if you are joining from a service organization. For anyone coming from another good product organization, the benefits and working style will not look good. Almost all the old EMC senior management has moved on. Its a Dell company now.

The only employees who can benefit are the managers who never change because they want to keep their positions. They only hire managers from outside the company so never dream of progressing while working there. Expect to work as a contractor for at least 2 years before they convert you to full time. The pay is below industry standard for the jobs they have. $16/hour to start and they may raise you up to $20 maximum after several years. You can find much better jobs in the valley that pay more than $20 and they provide you with benefits and you are full time from the get go. They use very old software technolgies and provide you with at least 6 tools to use instead of 1 centralized ERP that makes your life easier. They hold you responsible for any tiney maual mistake you do and act like jerks. Team members think they're managers and there is lots of conflict.

","Salary wasn't the most competitive for supply chain jobs (at least from what I heard among foreign companies), but that has also to do with the local market. Jobs that have been moved from western countries see lower salaries than their counterparts. Job grade levels and salaries are constantly pushed down or people are not replaced to save money, which can be a disheartening for the employees who stay, but that is quite common in big companies I believe. To grow within the company you often need to accept responsibilities of a higher-grade role before receiving adequate compensation and promotion, which can affect your work/life balance, but the opportunities are there if you are willing to work hard.

","# No opportunity to learn additional courses, since managers are too much concerned about their budget. They are not concerned about their team members career aspirations, they will tell they support your aspiration. But they won't do anything! Managers are concerned about their job and target, not about your career. Their goals are our goals, you are not allowed to write your aspirations in the annual goal sheet. # Monotonous work, which definitely won't help you to grow. # Moving internal is very tough, even though you got experience/qualifications. # Mid-level managers doesn't encourage communicating with top management, even though leaders encourage it always. # Difficult to get visibility from managers, if your team is big. Hence forced to look for job outside the organization, even if you like the organization. # Ongoing Cost controlling/cutting initiatives.

Pros
You can change jobs every 18 months. They have cafeterias in every building, you can order food to your desk, and have fresh robot-made coffee!
Cons
Organization and political complexity. Constant changes! Many of the leaders at VP or higher level only care about themselves at the expense of doing what is right for Dell. Many defy the question “if you were Michael Dell, would you make that decision”. Often times you would answer that question “no way in hell”, so then why are these people wasting money, resources, and employee sanity... poorly aligned incentives and self preservation.

They have conditioned the customers to buy at the end of the month or the end of the quarter to get the great deals. Executives come to town and give away deep discounts to close deals that otherwise may close in near term. If the customer doesn't have the ability to buy at the end of the month / quarter for any number of reasons the pressure tactics can create a deal breaker. Reps will dump accounts that they did a ""one and done"" see you in 3 yrs end of quarter deals leaving the quota and the account clean up / possible broken promises for the new guy. The sales jobs are good for 2.5-4 years. The guys that last longer have a few good established accounts that continue to produce.

If you are good, you got to work on some interesting distributed systems problems. Unfortunately this phase ended with Dell merger.
","After Dell, the team I was on, was essentially wrecked. Hiring freeze and no attempt to retain best talent meant all good engineers left.

I expect a certain amount of required training on corporate policies but its a bit heavy. More importantly it is obvious innovation is a thing of the past at this company. They keep up with the rest of the industry and do a great job at maintaining what will become the legacy of the industry. In other words, the downward spiral that often happens to excessively large companies is starting. I suspect they are headed down the path of many of the companies that were once great.

Pay and benefits are good. Corporate Incentive Bonus is a big plus, not just words, as Dell pays ever year some better than others but much better than any other company I have been with. Depending on your role there are remote work options. Other great benefits around employee wellness and discounts. The Dell employee purchase program can really save you some money.
Cons
Large company that goes through a lot of changes. You will get shuffled around a lot to new groups and managers. I am on my 6th director in 5 1/2 years. Working hours can be long and a lot of siloed work for customers, so not lot of team involvement.

","Everything is being moved offshore. There is no loyalty from the company, especially since the Dell acquisition. There are always work force reductions going on now, and there is very little strategy around why. Dell finance now controls everything, and will make poor decisions that can flip a project from profitable to negative overnight, with no impact on them but all the impact passed on to delivery teams. Messaging from leadership is spotty and tries to obscure the truth. Everything that was promised during the merger has been put to the wayside, and benefits have slowly gotten worse. Cost cutting is everything, even when it negatively impacts employees and clients.

The time off after 5 years with the company in the US is 4 paid weeks of vacation plus 2 weeks of personal/sick time off as well. Until recently, the work/life balance score would have rated as a pro, too, since Dell was finally catching up on letting its employees work remotely so as not to be tethered to a cubicle in a hot Central Texas office for a job that can be done over Skype and email from anywhere. Alas. . .
","It seems that each year the executive leadership in charge of IT either abdicate and flee or they get pitched some new & improved methodology or business model that requires a major upheaval of the existing organizations and interrupts the in-flight projects being worked under last year's buzzworthy methodology. Next year, some enterprising young consultant will probably show them a time- and money-saving new method involving three-toed sloths embedded in the on-site teams, and the execs will fly in dozens of sloths to try and make that model work. When they do, I hope they post lots of videos, because sloths are ridiculously adorable, even from a corporate hell hole that's lost all empathy for its employees.

","Morale is at an all time low, due to constant fear of job cuts, with zero reassurance from management. Strange weird cult like vibe centered around ""Culture code"", something which is forced on you daily, and actually gets in the way of doing your job. No engineering ideas are taken on board, all ideas are about cutting and making the product as cheap as possible to shift boxes. No vision from Management, the old EMC heads are taking a head in the sand approach and new Dell Management don't have a clue so are just cutting engineering and hiring sales to try and shift a product that is losing all relevance in the modern market.

I had an employee who needed to be on short term disability and it took me several workdays worth of calls/emails/hanging out on hold to get information on how she could apply for it.

","After VCE was acquired by EMC which in turn was acquired by Dell we've witnessed - and are still witnessing - what Dell calls 'harmonization' of roles, processes, benefits, salaries and procedures. Instead of harmonization they should have called 'vandalizing' or 'thrashing' or 'defacing' or 'destruction'. Development of products that were successful for years has been stopped. Successful Account Managers have been prevented from seeing their clients with the result that the relationship that they had formed throughout the years has been completely disregarded for the advantage of the Account Managers closer to the Dell leadership. Processes that had been working for years have been scrapped and replaced by 'standard' processes that make sense for one organisation, not all of them. Organizations that have been successful have been forced to work in different ways, with the obvious result of mass exodus of talent that had been in the company for years. We have been force fed meeting and twits and presentations and cons call about how brilliant and seamless the merge has been. Well, really? no. So, if you are planning to work for this company make sure in the interview you ask the right questions, because this has become a massive, awkward, clumsy, bulky corporate environment where individualism is a swear word.

","First of all 1-month training is a complete disaster - most things you learn there are not related to your everyday job. Almost everything you need to learn by yourself when you are already ""on the floor"". Fortunately teammates are very helpful. However because of inappropriate training and onboarding there is a huge rotation because newhires resign after first 2 months. Second problem - as an entry level employee or even manager you mean nothing at this department. Procedures and processes are prepared by people who have no idea how your work looks like.

Business Outlook
Pros
Overall Dell is a meritocracy and if you can produce you will be rewarded. The people are fair, good and generally work hard. Other pros include: * Encouraged to do the right thing for the customer * Everything is above board and straightforward including sales * Customers tend to follow the straightforward honest work of Dell itself * Teams tend to exist for long periods of time without a lot of churn meaning that the teams are strong. In other words your immediate teammates will be there and work with you. * Dell is very serious about the Tell Dell annual survey which is an opportunity for the rank and file to give feedback to all levels of the organization in an anonymous fashion. I've seen this correct problems with 'challenging managers' and bad teams. Dell is focused on keeping it's people.
Cons
There are still merger activities going on between Dell and EMC creating a little bit of instability between the different units. In general this is smooth, but sometimes it creates conflicts between different units. Another con is career development. In the early days it was pretty easy, as Dell grew promotion generally comes via lateral transitions to opposite teams. This can be considered a pro as well in that once in a role, it tends to be pretty stable without a lot of immediate team churn.

Annual 360 reviews of *all* staff contributes to openness to improve. Company culture is: -very positive and nurturing. -inclusive and fair. Long term careers at Dell are viable (currently). Management teams receive good training and are professional through out. Meritocratic progression/culture as far as it can be seen.
Cons
Silo mentality in some departments which leads to frustrating ""inertia"" (hence only 4 stars). Translates into perception of ""indecision"" when actually, people are working frantically in the background, simply trying to get people to engage in a 130,000+ company. Cross org collaboration is already on Mgmt radar, but difficult to change due to sheer volume of work. Opportunities to move into different areas that are not directly related to your vertical isn't so easy (but management teams are aware of this - remedial activities limited to within BU at the moment). Although my recruitment process was actually very good, others I've met haven't had such a great experience. This doesn't reflect the core capability of Dell UK, who generally aim to do their best and are very capable. Not the top in terms of salary, but good training resources (training every quarter) and initiative to manage your own time - micro-managing doesn't happen, which is great.

Some principle engineers always tries to avoid technical discussions that shows how impotent they are. But such people are white-collars there for nothing. Managers doesn't have sporting spirit in reaction for managerial reviews. Rather they target engineers during appraisals, layoffs etc.. Layoffs are there every month and only survival point is you should be a pet to your manager. It was not the case earlier. Some QA mangers are far better than development manager in some groups. This company has worst HR team and doesn't address to employee comments specially of low level engineers. Layoff are very common here.

2017-09-21, Inside Sales Representative II,"Round Rock, TX","Former Employee, more than 1 year",review for small business segment,"In the small business segment they definitely teach you as much as they can in training, so it's not a problem if you've never been in sales or don't know how computers work. Depending on the team your on (inbound or outbound) the KPI's are pretty reasonable. Unlimited overtime, uncapped commission, lots of ""competition"" money available that's not considered part of your quoted pay or benefits, TONS of free food (like some weeks I never had to buy or bring lunch) KPI's are predictable, and if you're not hitting those they have a good track record for performance improvement plans. Lots of people go on PIPs and end up having great numbers in the months afterward. Great opportunity to learn more about technology from both a hardware and software perspective AND once you're in the Dell network it's much easier to transfer to another department or position that you might find more attractive.
","Working in the small business segment is a little bit like working in a frat house. The reps are rowdy and whiny. While there are a number of more middle aged employees (people of all ages work on this floor), they tend to hire a lot of young people and recent grads which I think attributes to some of the rowdiness. There are so many ""incentives"" to sell that people end of coddled and throw a fit if they don't immediately get the gift card they won or the free lunch they were promised before. Things can change at the drop of a hat. I had an emergency and took a Friday off and when I came in Monday I had a new desk and a new manager. KPI's are predictable, but management will be really slack one week then bring the hammer down the next week (like firing people for not hitting very specific numbers). This pressures the reps to do some shady things. Sometimes management turns a blind eye to these things, especially if it's ""technically"" within the bounds of what's allowed. To give them credit, I have seen reps fired for doing unethical things, and one of the company's core values ""Winning with Integrity"" does come up a lot when people start mentioning those shady practices. Work life balance is difficult. Putting in longer hours to learn more about the product and processes definitely helps in the beginning, and then even more so when longer hours mean more talk time with more customers. But obviously this is difficult if you have kids. People get promoted based on good numbers and tenure. While I believe those both matter, a poor salesperson might actually make a good coach, and a good salesperson might make a terrible coach. I've heard of manager's not getting promoted to positions they deserved because they were 1 month outside the required tenure. That's a technicality and shouldn't matter if the person is skilled (which they were). There's also this growing schism between what they practice and what they preach. Training was like this fairytale land where you could be good at your job and grow into the position with integrity. When you hit the floor it's like every man for himself and you do whatever you can to sell more. At times the manager's will encourage you do what you were trained on, and at other times they say the only things that matter are what you're.

Work-life balance is great if you have the guts to stick to it (most people fall for the carrot). Pay is between 36,000 and 60,000 (regardless of education or technical background). Just sell.
","Sales management is weak (high school diploma or college drop-outs). They have favorites when it comes to promotions and assigning territory (which determines how your career progresses or ends). Sales quota is challenging. People with tenure haven't got a raise for years now (as of August 2017). Unhealthy internal competition due to different incentive plans for team members.

Pros
The experience you gain while working for a company of this size is fantastic. Many opportunities to work with cross functional teams and gain visibility into new areas of technology and business.
Cons
Unfortunately the current culture is losing its focus on Consulting Services. Historically Dell has jettisoned its Consulting business at different points through the years. Given the recent acquisition of EMC, and the changes in senior leadership specifically within the Consulting Services organization, I don't believe Services will remain a high strategic priority from a corporate perspective.

Engineering is placed on a pedestal and doesn't even own tickets that are in engineering state while not uncommon in other jobs its a bad practice and hurts time to resolution. if it is a bug they should own that. they put out process changes that have to be acknowledged by you when they want to hold you accountable for something but are not consistent in sending these for all major changes.

","Dell IT is chaotic so if you thrive on chaos and you're in IT, this is the place for you. Dell IT Leadership seems to make hasty decisions. Multiple rounds of lay-offs have led to low morale. Some of the legacy EMC IT Leadership seems to care more about what Dell Leadership thinks and are forgetting to listen to and take care of their employees...the leadership was much better prior to the merger. Too much emphasis on cost cutting in Dell, many of the IT jobs are being moved overseas. Benefits have decreased post the merger, they were better at EMC. Culture code is good in theory, behavior being exhibited by a lot of the IT Leadership is contrary to the culture code.

Perhaps the bonuses and gifts were probably the best things. In regards to gifts, they would give out like a $50 amazon gift card if you were performing well or something even better, or even time off from the queue for as long as 2 hours and still get paid.
","Required approval from team leads or management on EVERY part that was to be sent out for replacement on each clients computers. Had to go by a stupid form to trouble shoot a problem that you already know how to trouble shoot, they literally had to see the form results pasted in the notes on each call that we got. Team leads that were hired 6 months from the role I started, running the show there way, example would be that if you didn't go by the form that you were supposed to follow, they will put you in a one on one with them in a room and had to explain why we're not following that form. If it continues, you had to sit with the team leads and the manager and threaten you with verbal warnings. Also we had to open a case for every call that we take, and take ownership of that case until fully resolving there issue. There were more than many instances where we needed to get off the inbound calls, and take outbound time to make those calls to the customers we owned, but we're denied because of the queue being so slammed, and then we would get in trouble by the management as to why we haven't been touching our cases EVERY DAY! Little did they realize they never gave us the time to do so, it was like slaving in there. Another thing is that they are always hiring, you would see a group of 20+ people every 2-3 months take a training class, after almost 2 month of training and start taking calls on the floor. Possibly about 65-80% of those people that was hired had left Dell within a time frame of 1-3 months after there training as it was just to complicated for them with the way this business is running.

2017-08-01, Network Operating Systems Analyst,,"Former Employee, more than 5 years",Deleted all evidence of work,"Michael Dell called my desktop twice during my tenure at Dell. The first time was to make sure I would be viable after I volunteered to take a furlough. Mr. Dell also assured me he would pay me back. The second time, he called to yell at me for a customer escalation. I did fix it.
","Before coming to Dell and during my tenure I had established with linux kernel developers via the linux kernel mailing list. I was able to use my relationship between Dell Engineering and the opensource team to make introduction and solve problems for Dell. I gained a lot of visibility with both teams. Under duress a Dell leverage my relationship with the linux team and donated servers for the mailing linux. The trade off was, linux kernel team deleted all traces of my contribution to the linux kernel from the archive. The reasoning was because they, in my opinion, was they felt threaten because at the time I was a low level employee, and could leverage the major players for the linux kernel. This went all the up to a VP level. Dell culture is one that they will hire anyone regardless of education. However, a lot of people feel very insecure about the jobs. Before, I left the company, various account teams leveraged me a lot to resolve the customer escalation. I worked a very high level, and all my customer escalation were resolved. I was there ""goto guy"". The reason for the review is since, After, I left the company for a number of years on the Dell EMC companies recruited me for a performance engineer job. It would have been great to show my linux contribution history.

Broad exposure to the hardware product side of IT makes it a good environment for starting a pre-sales tech career in IT.
Cons
Training and development focus for tech pre-sales roles is on sales skills, product feature/benefit/competitive rather than achieving and maintaining quality industry certifications. Other IT vendors and system integrators do a much better job of developing and maintaining technical skills for their pre-sales engineers. Retains the volume box-mover mentality, micro-managing the business to weekly sales numbers. Staff churn rate

Cons
More directors and managers. Very few core technical people. Hiring is completely based on the referrals and more and more relatives, friends with non technical people every where specially in Dell IT and edell area. Technical people are not getting treated good and getting paid less where as people who just fill the excel sheets with same information everyday getting higher salaries. All the senior level directors are hiring a lot of contractors not to save money but they are getting their cut from vendors. Millions of dollars are just getting wasted in wrong implementations of projects. Nexus between the senior level management to appreciate each others so that they are able to move from one group to another group. Wrong presentation and representation to the CEO level. Less work more politics. No accountability. Hundreds of emails for silly issues. If you write code you have no respect in Dell but if you are a person who can talk all non sense and create PPT's and excel sheets, which after 3 months doesn't make sense you will be top shot.

My experience was I worked in a small group of 70 employees and that group was only allowed to promote one individual in a given year due to the internal politics of promotions/budgets. I was on the promotion track and leading up to my end of year review was told I was doing everything required to be promoted to the next pay level. Then when the year ended I was not promoted and was told it was because there are so many talented people in my group the promotion had to go to XYZ person. I did work in an amazing group with top-knotch people, but when the company limits how many promotions they can assign due to budgets based on group size that isn't in line with their meritocracy philosophy.

Leadership on the global and national perspective from the k12 educational team is male driven with little to no classroom or k12 leadership experiences. The male dominant team have been out of the classroom role for more than 15+ years, making their leadership styles, views and k12 education voice stale and irrelevant. The women members of the k12 education are the worker bees and are viewed as the mandatory doers of the delegated task lists. If you want to kill your creativity and have your professional character and image devalued quickly as an educator, then you would be the right fit on this disjointed k12 education team. They need to do some major housecleaning/ vetting of the male leaders and directors to make change and to be truly respected in the k12 teaching and learning space.

Pros
Dell name looks good on your resume Michael Dell has decided to move to the Data Center market, lap tops are still a core business. Moves at glacier pace/slow due to being a global company- must follow the process no matter how inane it might be If you can last here at an ""IT"" company longer than 6 years...you have learned the ""Dell way--nuances"" They like to hire from within Dell because the internal hires have learned these nuances... you don't say it, you just KNOW what they are insinuating. Interesting place. HR and Talent Acquisition are ""trying"" to allow employees to work remote, but most business groups won't allow this. You can be wandering the campus, but they want you see you around.
Cons
Politics- ugh! Salaries low for IT company Is A private company, so unlike most IT companies, they do not offer-- stock options as part of a package just a 8, 10 or 15% annual bonus to your salary. To compensate for lack of stock, they offer the engineers an additional bonus called LTI. Managers are so concerned about hurting people's feelings that communication isn't really ""real""- you get the double talk. Felt like a had a new direct manager every 3-6 months. There for 2+ years.

Depending on project you may enjoy work life balance.
","No real and high quality project.As long as billing is given by the client you will be asked to do anything.I have seen technical people asked to generate excel sheet report. Management is useless and political and will make you do anything to keep their jobs safe. Higher management treat EMC consulting division differently than EMC product division. Benefits and compensation is less compared to EMC product division EMC consulting has short term vision of clocking minimum billing utilisation by any means. Lack of long term vision and willinglyness to make an impact. You get everything if you say Yes to anything your boss say. Management do not have respect and empathy for Technical resources who actually do the job and treat them as disposable commodity. Management do not try to retain good technical talents as they only care about head count and utilisation. If you are in conflict with management for any valid reason chances are you will fired because they want puppets. If you are on bench you will be micro managed badly. EMC US management don't have any belief and trust on EMC consulting India unit. If you have got an offer from DELLEMC consulting for technical role please take a deep breath and get good night's sleep ,get up next morning try to get offer from other company and try your best not to join DELLEMC consulting.

Dell guys seems to be heavily on receiving end with job cuts, or rank demotions, role or job scope change, work and compensation plan related decisions causing collapse of a lot of older commercial business within dell and teams representing that business. Lot of people are unhappy and angry but can't do much and helpless and afraid. Due to total control by EMC managers especially in lower to upper middle management layers mostly EMC is in full control. Many people have lost jobs or left or ask to leave or change job scope etc. More and more interaction with fellow dell folks is painting more and more negative and grim picture of new combined entity and it's Managers.

Pros
Work/life balance is pretty fair depending on the department. The cafeteria food has a healthy variety, and the fitness facilities are good for the monthly investment.
Cons
Dell fosters a toxic culture in which screaming at subordinates is considered strong. If you're with the ""in"" crowd, then almost nothing you do in the name of ""driving for results"" could be bad. It's a mercenary environment to say the least. Personal insults made via faceless phone calls and email terrorism maintain the politics of fear. The core message is: there is a long line of people that are more educated and willing to work for half your salary; keep looking over your shoulder. You could be the victim of the regular, quarterly Workforce Reduction at any moment.

","In sales they move you into new positions without consulting you. This happened in 2016 like every 90 days or so.For example, they would often change selling roles from a pure sales specialist to a technical consultant even though you may not be a very technical type like a systems engineer. You have no choice in this movement, you either accept the new role or leave. Quotas are huge and basically unattainable. They change your account list at the drop of a hat. So the hard work you put into an account can be yanked away in 90 days. Dell says that they want their sales force to be considered ""trusted advisors"" by their customers, but not really. 70% of sales people are on a performance plan at Dell at any point of time. Dell acquired EMC in 2016 and has taken over the sales process. The inside and outside sales people at Dell are top notch and pounded for numbers. Lastly, delivery on components can be a big problem. Dell had multiple months of notice on this coming component shortage problem and didn't plan well. The sales people suffered the pain and lost many sales due to this since Dell couldn't ship the necessary parts.

As a result, an arrogance started to develop where customers were told to take it or leave it. Eventually, competitors came about but a lot of that arrogance still remains. I think that EMC will see more long term success when they temper their attitude. It does not sit well with customers and leaves a bad taste in their mouths.

Great environment to gain knowledge and insight about computers. Continued learning with certificate earning. Great benefits.
","Dell has very low retention rates because they micro-manage and under appreciate their employees. The micro-managing is from top level down exploiting the employee and over demanding. They do not pay for everything that you're doing and the L2's 9/10 times are not helpful and get upset when you ask for help constantly as you're trying to learn. Metrics are messed up. If you're out of town for vacation, your metrics keep running and lower your numbers which affect you, Your CE is a apart of your metrics which does not help. For example, if a customer is upset because you can't send out a hard drive because of policy rules, the customer can then review you and give you a 1 on your rating from 1 to 10 and bring your CE down massively just because you were following the rules. Management rarely backs you up and management is terrible. There are some pretty terrible managers out there some who do not have the proper training to lead. Your metrics can go down by simply doing your job. If a customer hangs up the phone, you have to call them back and you get bad metrics for returning a call. How is it your fault that the customer disconnected the phone? If the customer calls back in for whatever reason even though you're continuously emailing him/her, you get metrics hit. The metrics prevent you from succeeding there to your full potential. Not much career advancement. Extra hard work and effort is not recognized so half the time you're making the same as the guy who is just sliding by at work. People quit 3-4 months in the job so you're always having to help train the newbees. No work life balance at all. If you're going in at work at 9:00AM and suppose to get off at 6PM, you might not get off until 8:00PM. You can literally receive a call 30 seconds before you're suppose to get off and you can't transfer the call so you really can't make commitments because you never know when you're going to get off. You can get in trouble for needing to use the restroom because of ACD. A lot of employees develop anxiety and have high stress levels because of this job and people are truly underappreciated. Senior Management always states that ""this is the most difficult job in the company"" and understand that they are underpaying their employees.

Job opportunities are abundant where investment is deemed necessary, though much of this seems very short-term given the amazing growth and changes Del is going through.
","Strategy seems sound, but tactically many organizations are in chaos. There is no strategic top to bottom. More top is strategy, bottom is pure tactics. Like many corporations there is very filtered discussion around strategy. Sharing challenges, cons or other areas of problems is not shared well. The culture focuses on the pros. The open door policy is good when the news is good, otherwise best to keep to yourself. 2 things truly bother me here. Firstly, there is little strategic planning across BUs (including cross-selling GTM activities), and little if any from the Executive Director level down. Much of what occurs below VPs appears to be very reactive. This affects people greatly, often having to ""work around"" process issues, system issues and departmental dysfunction.

I live in fear of getting laid off in one of the frequent firing sprees that has been going on with the Dell EMC merger. I've seen good people come and go as management shifts around.

Smart people (about half), some good perks, good pay. No traffic getting to work. Briggo coffee is amazing. The EMC merger helped with benefits.
Cons
Management is still largely white and male. It's Hard to get promoted if you're a woman and an introvert. Uninspiring.

Their policies are very family-friendly, and they provided a generous package of vacation, days off for other needs, 401K, healthcare, etc. I was dubious about the prospects of working for Dell when they acquired my company, but it turned out to be a mostly positive experience. I'm sorry my 3 years there ended.
","Like any large company, Dell has internal bureaucracies that are inefficient and often maddening. The timecard system is decades old, slow, and unstable; the security policies, such as changing passwords every 60 days, are nonsensical; etc. But my biggest complaint stems from their decision to enter the software business, acquiring companies left and right, and then deciding to abandon software, laying off hundreds of people and divesting the remaining pieces. Hardware companies have the wrong DNA to do software, and Michael Dell should have known this. The acquisitions followed by layoffs damaged careers and destroyed good products. Dell did a disservice to many people through this ""experiment"".

Reasonably good benefits although they are not as inexpensive as they should be considering Dell's size. Lots of good people doing good work.
Cons
Can be stable, long term employment. But there are reductions across business units frequently so there is underlying fear in long term stability. Lots of good people here but there is a constant struggle to get anything of substance done due to the bureaucracy and silos across global Dell.

Vacation time policy, sick time, 401k-match all feel like good benefits, and the company puts in effort to cultivate employees if the company direction has to change or the employee is struggling.
","Raises within a position are very small or nonexistent here - if you want to increase your pay after entering a position, you'll need to either change positions or leave the company if internal advancement is not possible. When changing positions, there's a 'cap' on the possible increase in salary - because this exists, an externally-hired employee could be offered more than a better-qualified internally-hired employee for a given position. This combined with stagnant raises can undermine the statement of 'meritocracy' they drive internally. Overall company direction has been very acquisition-heavy, but they haven't made the most of the acquisitions they've paid for.

Pros
Passionate and smart co-workers, fast-paced, focus really is on delivering the best experience for customers. Very complex operations with few centralized or documented processes - but teams work with openness and transparency. Dell employee culture (at headquarters) is unique, the only place I've ever worked where co-workers openly share information and are happy to answer any questions or work to help find an answer if they don't know. Employees are empowered to make decisions and propose solutions from the bottom up. Work from home focus brings freedom and allows people to do their best work in the setting most suited to them while keeping balance between home and life.
Cons
Complex operations with few centralized or documented processes can get in the way of delivery. (Even though that also leads to opportunities.) Changes to culture with merger are bringing top-down marching orders and secrecy where openness and empowerment once lived.

2017-01-06, Inside Sales Representative II,"Round Rock, TX","Former Employee, more than 5 years",Used to be a Fantastic Company,"Benefits are great, week off during Christmas time, good resume builder
","When I first started at Dell, I absolutely loved my job. It took a bit to build my pipeline and learn the business, but once I got rolling, it was great. There were stressful parts of it at times of course, but that is expected in sales positions. Quotas were attainable if you worked really hard and growth was completely realistic. If you worked hard, met your quota and were a good employee, you could advance and move up in the company. Upper management were great, and were always offering extra added incentives to boost employee satisfaction and morale, and give incentive to work harder. A lot has changed in the past two years and the company is no longer even close to the same culture it was in the beginning of my career with Dell. The pressure from upper management was at an all time high, I had some of the most incredible managers when I started here, all of which have since moved on as a result of the new culture that has been created. I have seen several people, extremely good reps that have been with the company 10+ years, get let go last year, and Dell hire a new person to take over those accounts as a level I when the account set requires a level III or IV person to manage it. I had also witnessed several territories get split up and added to different rep's territories and the reps who were previously in those territories, get let go in blink of an eye. I understand the merger brings layoffs and they must cut the slack in certain areas, but I saw several very good reps, that made a lot of money for the company and knew their business extremely well, get let go, when there were other available positions they could have moved them into. From my observation, there seemed to be a lot of this going on in an effort to make cost cuts from the EMC merger. They were also in the process of changing the base/commission split from 70/30 to 60/40 when I left the company. There had been so much added pressure at the end, from what we were told, in an effort to weed people out. It was extremely difficult, almost impossible to move up into a higher role, or even from an ISR II to ISR III. This feeling was mutual throughout the my whole floor, my entire team was looking for a new career at the end of my time there, including several managers. I hope this is culture is only temporary through the merger as I think they have the potential to be incredibly successful as DellEMC if they make some serious changes.
