A Beer Bash is held almost every quarter. Lots of opportunities to cross train with different departments, even if it’s shadow time for a few days.
","If you stay in one department for too long, it’s harder to move upward within that group.

2021-09-30, Technical Specialist,,"Former Employee, less than 1 year","Coworkers were great, customers were the worst","My coworkers were all amazing, kind, and talented individuals. The team was very supportive and it was easy to talk to everyone. The managers really cared about the team and it showed. The pay was nice, we received a lump sum discount ($500, I think every 1-2 years) and a 10-15% discount (also applicable to family and friends).
","The customers were the worst part about the job. I was anxious to go to work everyday. Don't get me wrong, sometimes you'd get customers that were great and you'd get along with them well. However, it's the bad ones that stick. A lot of people will bend their phones or void their warranty and take it out on you. My coworkers were surprised that I didn't cry because of a customer during my time at Apple. The worst part about these customers is that they get sent a survey to rate you. If you get bad reviews, management will come to talk to you. 

On Christmas Eve, I once had a customer shove a watch band in my face and not say anything. No questions, no request to buy it, they just expected me to read their mind (I'm supposed to fix the phones too, not sell merchandise). I did it anyway so they wouldn't have to wait awhile. In return, I got a 1/5 star review without any comments.

Another gripe is the amount of work you need to do. You must do a minimum of 20 hours as part time. If you want a day off, you better be requesting that MONTHS in advance. Otherwise, tough luck. Best believe you will be working on all of the holidays. Black Friday is the worst.

Reaching out other reps and your account manager for best practices and to share information is a must but ultimately you are working on various campus locations solo.

","Apple is not all sunshine and daisies as they make it seem through all their propaganda in their videos and training material. Nearly every employee realizes this after around 6 months. There's a reason why the turnover rate is so high.
- This is no communication amongst leadership and the team. 
- Your base rate is below the national average. 
- There is 0 work/life balance and leadership can not change it because of how scheduling is done. Good luck applying for leave super far in advance.
- They say there are no KPI's but you are expected to be selling Applecare and such otherwise they passive aggressively have ""development"" conversations with you
- There is NO room for growth. The ceiling is so low, and for the few positions you can elevate to, its extremely competitive with people from around the state usually fighting for one spot at a store
- You have to deal with employees who are brainwashed by the Apple way, nothing the company does wrong phases them
- The way the company talks is so fake, there's always a cheery excuse for everything
- You will never have your way because there's a trillion dollar company imposing its law over you
- Favoritism. If you're a favorite you will get elevated, or paid more. There's some shady stuff going on in this company.

I have never ran out of sick time or vacation time, even as a part time employee. They have a tuition reimbursement program. There’s opportunities to mentor or be mentored by people in the field you want to be in or help others who want to get into your field. They do 401k matching and there’s ways they give back to charities you donate or volunteer with, on top of their own give-back programs they do with nonprofits and community outreach.

Also, if you work hard and succeed they reward it. The better you are at your job, generally speaking the higher your pay and/or end of year goodies.
","If you are an average or under performing or new hire or 3rd party hire, the lowest positions may not pay as well as some other lower end roles at other companies, such as a Verizon call center representative or Gravity Payments’ custodian, but they pay better than any regular wage job such as working at a fast food restaurant or a grocery store employee. If you are a full time employee, you can definitely live off your wages even if you have a family. With all the benefits and extras, you will feel happy at your job. 

Also if you just work hard/be efficient/innovative, your efforts are recognized!

","The innovators have since moved on so is now occupied by those following plans and instructions, loosely. There are many contractors, some who have little investment so you may pick up where someone who did not value their work left off. You are provided some of the worlds greatest benefits consequently due to sometimes unreasonable end goals. If you meet that goal you will be asked to improve upon what took everything you had to begin with. This is a good way to push someone to greatness although when you burn out due to this you will be replaced be so easily and quickly many have found they trained their replacement. Worth every experience though.

","Not Apples fault but retail is demanding. Hours are hard to make consistent, there are simply a lot of humans in this world that all deserve compassion and your ability to help them understand things. This just becomes tedious after a bit but most customers I help are very nice people. Some are maybe having a rough day. Either way it takes a toll on your mental energy.

2021-09-18, Software Engineering Manager,"Cupertino, CA","Current Employee, more than 5 years",Great place to developing an engineering and design mindset,"- Great corporate values to do good for the people and planet
- Top leadership cares and listens to the feedback 
- Stock compensation is better than most of the companies
- Learning is substantial as you learn how to stay focused and ship a product
","- Internal movement is stifled despite what the senior leadership claims
- You need to inform your manager if you are interviewing internally
- Not enough avenues to grow after a certain point 
- Growth is highly controlled by the manager and director
Advice to Management
- Please remove the requirement to inform your manager when you are interviewing internally. Any employees who are looking to move to other teams for whatever reasons, risk their bonuses, stock compensation, and growth opportunities when they inform their managers. It is unfair and restricts the internal movement. 
- Please develop internal tracks to make it easier for employees to switch to alternative careers, such as program management, product management, and software engineering. Encourage hiring managers to hire from the pool of employees who have signed up any of such tracks.

2021-09-17, Customer Relations,"Austin, TX","Former Employee, more than 3 years","Great company, terrible department","Amazing benefits, great company, no lay offs during pandemic.
","Customer Relations is the worst department. Honestly, all the call center positions are probably terrible. If you are on the phones, they don't want to promote you to a position that doesn't involve them, stating they think people will be bored if they can't talk all day.
Advice to Management
Actually help people get to a department where they will be happy and productive. Being the best person in a call center is a harsh way to choose who to promote. Acknowledge that people take a position at Apple because they need a job, and not everyone is built for call center work. 

Also, Apple states they work with everyone, but they don't care if a person is autistic and needs dimmer lights or anything else to help them be more productive. They do all they can to refuse a reasonable request.

Hours in the US are terrible. The other countries get Monday through Friday for the escalations queue. This should be the same in all countries. We should all have a proper weekend. Escalations should be a coveted position, not one that you take just to get in the door.

2021-09-16, Tier II IOS Advisor,,Current Employee,"Good gig, tough upswing","Job is insanely hard in the beginning, but if you stick with it you can become a god of Customer Service (and yes, Apple customers are very, very needy). However, their survey system they judge their advisors on is broken, has been broken, and will stay broken. Advisors are often dinged for the mis-steps or broken promises made by other advisors or service channels directly outside of their control. Getting awards, recognition, and promotions becomes a giant roulette wheel of ""hope I don't get screwed this month by bs customer surveys!""

I have lobbied to have anything, ANYTHING, to change this system and have met a brick wall with any and all attempts. And this is a shame, because Apple completely takes care of their employees with paid time off, tuition reimbursement, stock purchases and free restricted stock, etc, but this survey system just KILLS any enjoyment in doing technical support for this company. I'm looking for greener pastures and I wish I wasn't
","Great paid time off (i've been paid for every day off taken except for two in the last several years), great chance to get first-hand technical experience troubleshooting Apple products and services.

Yes we get paid a lot, but we are getting paid for 40 hours a week but can rarely work for just 40 hours a week. I lost so much hair from all the stress and late nights.

2021-09-14, Retail Specialist,,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",Great Experience,"Working at Apple has a lot more pros than cons:

- Awesome benefits such as neat discounts on services and products.
- Health & Dental Insurance for both part-time and full-time workers (there's a lot more they offer)
- Stock option on a discount 
- Internships for employees
- Free financial courses 
etc. etc. 

Overall, what can really make or break a good experience is management within the store. Apple is a company that really cares about both the customer and employee experience. Growth and development is taken very seriously at the company, and as long as you work hard and voice what you need/want, leaders will help you achieve your goals. You gain skills and expertise at this job which you can transfer literally anywhere else.
","This is a retail job which means that your hours will vary based on business needs. However, you can definitely adjust your availability to your liking as a part-timer. Expect to work every weekend. Like mentioned before, management within the store can make or break the experience at this amazing company, but not every Apple store is the same. Most personnel move to different stores with promotions.
Advice to Management
My advice for corporate is to pay close attention to high turn-over rates at specific locations in their retail market. Apple is a company that holds high expectations of their employees, and leadership plays a critical role in driving successful outcomes. Some leaders in different Apple markets have no idea what the heck is going on, and others are OUTSTANDING. It varies across markets. Overall, the benefits offered to Apple employees is truly excellent.

The removal of certifications has also stunted a lot of the external growth an employee can achieve when leaving Apple.

2021-09-12,Anonymous,,"Former Employee, more than 5 years",Lonely but proud,"It was a blast working for Apple. Makes for great conversation at parties. I loved helping people with getting their device tech issues resolved. I loved my co-workers and helping in my capacity as a Senior Advisor (Tier 2). The employee discount was helpful - but not awesome. Really good health insurance benefits.
","Being a remote (at-home) employee was super lonely. After six years I just burnt out. I repeatedly asked if there was a way the company would support get togethers with nearby advisors so we could connect face to face; but that went nowhere. Eventually I found people nearby and organized an unofficial meeting and had a great time. Networking is so important, but Apple really didn’t support that for people who worked from home. Additionally, the KPI were used as a weapon in ratings. Using numbers and reviews that were out of my control to determine my quarterly and annual review “score” never felt like a way to learn what to improve upon. Constantly asking what I can do to improve in order to get promotions or raises fell on deaf ears, although my Team Manager referred to me as a RockStar. For such a valuable company, they didn’t really pay that well. In my six years I went from $14/hr to just over $20/hr but it was extremely hard fought/won and I was left to myself if I were to have any success. ZERO mentorship offered - little more than words offered by direct management. They don’t really care about you as a person. Oh, and if you want to succeed at Apple I was told by a ‘successful’ employee that you can’t have a life outside of Apple. They’ll say they want you to have work/life balance, but when the rubber hits the road you better be %110 Apple 24/7/365. I hated leaving but I needed to take care of myself and my family.

","The difference between a great job that you love and a work environment that you hate is actually quite small. It is usually made up of the people you interact with. One bad local change in leadership can alter culture on a local level quite dramatically. Suddenly you find yourself unappreciated and the herd mentality of ‘yes men’ gaslighting individuals becomes the fulltime job — it becomes your life. Appreciating honesty and values driven decision making, must be central to Leadership. When it is not, you will find highly motivated, effective team members leaving. I guess in a short blurb that is easily digestible, that is the best advice I can offer someone considering to work in the retail environment. It can be a great company to work for, but when it is not — the politics of the organization will crush good people.

If you're willing to put in hard work, Apple will do the same for you.

- Sometimes you meet some wonderful, brilliant people
- If a VP supports a project, it likely will be funded
","- It is the most toxic work environment I have ever seen. Abuse and harassment run rampant. ER/HR are not there to help victims; they are there to gaslight victims and use victims as a scapegoat for when things go wrong.
- Apple’s values are all hollow and meaningless. They are just talking points for PR. Despite privacy being “a human right”, expect none as an employee. All those trainings about treating people with respect and dignity are laughable. Some of the worst abusers are also ones who get to speak at public events and announcements; there are never any consequences for their abusive behaviors.
- Chances are good that if you are a white dude with no experience, you will be offered more money than a woman of color with many years of experience. It is no wonder Apple has tried to stop pay transparency discussions among employees; the discrepancies are likely much worse than what has made the news recently. I also repeatedly saw white men being given credit for the work of women of color. If you are a woman of color, expect people to doubt your qualifications to the point of insulting you and your expertise.
- If you have integrity, this is not the place for you. Filing business conduct reports are known as “career limiting moves”. Without a good manager, you are SOL and will not have a chance of ever moving to another team or growing your career.
- Senior Leadership is incredibly out of touch with what their employees want and value.

When people call out it has a direct impact to your day and there are appointments booked that have to be taken care of regardless of how many people are working

","They act like they care about diversity and all that but tbh all they care about is how much you suck up to management. If you’re too good at sales you’ll never leave the sales floor they’ll just keep making you empty promises. I’ve been there for 3.5 years and have been at the top 5 of sales every quarter but i have never gotten any outside opportunities for anything but being on the sales floor but you’ll see people that have just gotten there get these opportunities like mentoring new hires and things like that. Apple is going in the wrong direction and it’s sad because Steve Jobs really cared about the people and now it’s just about money .
Advice to Management
Reward your hard workers for their hard work, don’t just promote people because you like them more. And stop thinking that brown people want to get promoted because they’re brown, most of us just want to get promoted based off of our hard work

2021-08-31,Anonymous,Cork,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",Too hyperfocused on KPIs,"The job is secure, that's about it. Discounts and benefits are just a trap to get you in.
","They are hyperfocused on metrics and treat you as if you were a broken machine if you don't deliver their desired number. Their tools for measuring your performance are a mess, don't measure accurately and you still get punished. Measuring KPIs is a micromanager's best tactic when promoting a fear atmosphere in an attempt to ""encourage"" productivity but in fact, does more to provide hurdles than to provide a clear path by which employees can become empowered to use their creativity and skills to do their job well... especially in a business that depends a lot on your client's satisfaction to drive. Don't get me wrong; some vital statistics are important to monitor progress over time, but too much emphasis on KPIs has a negative effect and is counter productive.
Advice to Management
You must be able to trust your people to do their jobs and you must allow your people to do their jobs. Forcing KPIs down people's throats changes your employees' focus from your client's satisfaction to attempting to achieve benchmarks that may not necessarily promote growth. Your workforce then becomes intent on satisfying internal goals rather than satisfying the client and thereby increasing revenue. 

The best way to get the best out of good employees, to tap into what makes people want to come to work, to get focused on the mission NOT on useless KPIs which become a target in themselves and result in demotivated employees, the death of creativity and high levels of staff turnover.

","If you’re a software engineer this isn’t a place to be. The work life balance is not existent for very bad reasons. That’s only because you won’t be able to use or build tools that can make your life easier. 

The over culture is very bureaucratic and there’s literally no check on the bad managers. In my experience they don’t care about teams success and there interests lie elsewhere. Few of them are downright psychotic - foster toxic environment, bullying, threatening, etcetera. 

Very, very hard to move internally. You have to let you current manager know before you make a contact with the future Hiring managers. The toxic managers may block your move if you don’t play ball despite having good reviews.

The benefits are awful as compared to other large tech companies. Heck even start-ups! You get 11 days PTO for working the whole year. They do have Christmas shutdown but everyone is forced to work to hit the deadlines that follow after the shutdown.

","- Non-existing work-life balance. This is not an exaggeration. People will email well beyond appropriate business hours, ping, text, email like they text. Weekend and late night work is expected. 

- Ridiculous overtime at no additional comp for salaried employees; this is “meeting expectations”. I’ve never been thanked or apologized to when interrupted on a Sunday afternoon. I have not had a weekend in a month. I did not get Memorial Day off, I had to skip Mother’s Day, I already know I will be expected to work Labor Day. What is the price of your time and life?

- Most execs and leads are men. My team is most female, on the ground level, while all leads are men.

I came from Google. It was an extremely tough decision to make. The creative is stronger here; there is no arguing that. That’s why I came. In comparison to Google, who also has peak moments of large work volume, my experience has been that Apple does not consider the cost and considerations of pushing for more work. The compensation isn’t as comparable to Google. The benefits are definitely not. The culture is teetering toxic. Essentially, on all other levels aside from creative and cool co-workers, I’d recco Google hands down.
Advice to Management
Want to keep your employees and reduce the burn and churn? Thank them. Protect them. Don’t speak on behalf of them. Ask them how they’re doing. Create small team culture where they are unofficial afternoons off, to balance the exorbitant amount of overtime.

2021-08-29, Specialist,"Aventura, FL","Former Employee, more than 5 years",Go to any other store but this one,"With Apple, this job does great to take care of you with their benefits, even for part timers. The coworkers there are great and they are very open and friendly with open minds.
","Once the store went flagship they really started to care less and less about their workers and see you as a number. 

This specific store location is not a model Apple location to work at. I would suggest transferring to another store or starting somewhere else entirely. The management here really don't listen to HEAR you out, but continue to speak to speak their spiel.

They promote by favoritism, they don't give equal opportunities to try new roles as they preach they do, instead the managers will push for someone they prefer instead of giving and letting everyone know on the website itself when they're looking to fill in a new role or experience. Someone was here for a few months and got promoted to lead, and only to be gone within the next couple of month. Someone else was newly hired and soon promoted within a few months, because they had relations with a previous manager. I've seen people work their butts off, produce amazing results, and they're ignored because the management and leadership team doesn't think they'll ""fit in"" with their group. 

During the pandemic, when we opened back up there were things that clearly showed how focused they were on making money and not our safety, leaving cleaning solutions with no rags and taking out the hand sanitizers that were previously on the table (when we were closed to the public and only had a window store front, where there was less of a chance to catch covid mind you), then rush you when you try to clean and wipe down the products you and your customer were using, before taking another customer.
Advice to Management
Promote more people from within the company instead of bringing outsiders in to preach for our company's values when they're still unlearning their previous company's structure and models. The managers here are people persons, knowing how to talk but the support to find specific solutions is becoming more sparse day by day the more they hire from outside. 

Listen to your team and try to understand the process of sales instead of handing the problem to a team expert or pro and thinking that's that. It doesn't help the team if we feel like we can't go to you in the first place. 


HR had to be called so many times because of how your true colors showed, especially opening our store back up during the peak of the Delta Variant of Covid.

Learn the procedures, or even take a customer yourself to show us what you would do better and how you would do it, instead of half listening to interactions and only putting negative input.

You're draining everyone's energy and this is why people go on leaves or leave this store.

And where do you guys go to hide during peak times when we need you?

","Most depressing job ever, management act like they care about you but truly dont care about you at all. Very cult like were shocked if you had a life outside of work, which was terrifying. Managers could not take any criticism or even hear any ideas from people less than them, I told a manager something that would benefit our work environment and he told me off saying I was being aggressive when I was nowhere near being aggressive. A clear example of management acting like you are the crazy one. 
Very obvious discrimination and management had favourites which always were promoted.
After all this you would think you get paid well, when in reality salary is well below expected and pay-rise is determined on your sales.

2021-08-24, Business Expert,,Former Employee,Perception vs reality…one of the worst companies I have worked for.,"Apart for the name, you don’t have many other pros. They are to big to care, and offer absolutely zero development. They think they are the innovators of change, they maybe in terms of product but they certainly aren’t in people management and leadership. Would not recommend at all.
","Everything about the company. To big to care, zero personal development, no progression, no recognition and after a few years… absolutely no job satisfaction or fulfilment in your daily work. Also, absolutely ZERO FLEXIBILITY AND NO WORK LIFE BALANCE!! not an employer of choice and don’t choose because of the name.
Advice to Management
Everything above, they won’t listen because they are to big and don’t care. Soon they will be in the top 100 companies Not to work for, and should seriously consider undercover boss.

2021-08-20, Product Specialist,,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Great compared to most retail, but still just a retail job","-Pay is relatively above average, part time employees get all benefits, employee stock purchase program is a huge plus
-Education assistance, gym membership rebate, doctors, lawyers, therapy, among many other discounted and/or free services (even as just a part time employee! use these!!)
-Not commission based so I don't necessarily feel pressured to upsell products that the customer doesn't need (exception: see cons)
- Get to be surrounded by Apple products all day (as an Apple fan-boy, this was great)
- Great to talk apple products all day with customers, actually try to find the best product variation for them and learning about new and different ways people use their computers and devices
- Discount is great, almost bad due to how much I used it
- A great way to get into Apple Corporate, using ""Career Experiences"" where you work for corporate for a limited time and possibly get offered a full time job. Apple Retail while going to college is a easy decision to make if you're goal is eventually Apple Corporate.
- Relatively flexible schedule, flexible management
- Having Apple on your resume automatically puts you to the top of the resume list of your next employer (relatively speaking of course, that alone won't do much if you aren't capable of your next opportunity)
- Learn a lot of Apple products to use later in life for yourself and others
","I joined in 2020, so I am not sure how things were before, but I had a lot of people tell me Apple Retail was not as ""sales-y"" as it has become with its services, especially AppleCare. I understand we have metrics to meet as a public company, but at times, it felt no different than being a commission-based employee with how often they pressured us to sell AppleCare and get Business Intros.
-While Apple is overall a great place to work relatively speaking, it is still just a retail job. Meaning you're co-workers aren't all going to be apple-fanantics who love Apple products and everything about their job. Its going to be like every other job where there are the try-hards, the normal people, and the lazy people. There are going to be bosses who are overly micro-manage-y and some managers who are just great and everything I would want in a manager.
- There are a lot of conflict of interests and policies around technology development and working at other technology jobs. Make sure you have no plans of developing any software while working for Apple unless you plan to let Apple own it. 
- We have a bad habit of letting rude and loud customers get what they want and giving the nice customers who actually deserve an exception a hard time. Really hated appeasing rude and obnoxious customers. Really hated turning down exceptions to customers who asked nicely and were in a situation that warranted an exception. 
- Its easy to sip the Apple Juice, try to remain un-biased and see through the Corporate bs. (But don't become one of the grudegy twitter anon accounts, they're over exaggerating and taking for granted their job at a RETAIL STORE).
Advice to Management
Relax on the AppleCare metrics. A large part of the reason I love Apple and wanted to work for Apple was because I knew I wouldn't have to upsell things to customers that they don't need. Even when customers had relatively good arguments for not getting AppleCare, I would also be told by leadership a phrase or strategy for turning it around on the customer and making it seem like AppleCare was good for them. Sometimes, customers just don't need it.

","The call center managers do not watch the phone volume and frequency forget their customers. They can secretly pull out call center representatives out of the phone queue as a personal favor, and let the others take back to back calls, let the customers wait for ever. Lack of transparency and fairness.
Advice to Management
As a call center, taking inbound calls is the basic responsibility. Make sure the managers receive proper training and education so that they can treat employees fairly. The managers should also take phone calls if the waiting time is too long.

2021-08-18, Order Administrative Representative,,"Former Employee, more than 8 years","Run far away from the RCC deptartment in Austin, TX","The pay is okay, great benefits, discounted price on Apple stocks, 401k that is matched up to 6 percent, discounts on Apple products.
","Over the years, the RCC department (Retail Contact Center), formerly known as the Apple Online Store department, has gone from an okay place to work to a horrible place to work. I had worked in the department since 2007 and left in 2021. My team was the order administration team. My team did back-end customer service, and people liked the job since you did not get inbound phone calls. However, we would, on occasion, have to call customers. Most of our contact with customers was via email. 

About two years ago, management decided to combine our team with the service teams, which are on the phone. Once this happened, things started going downhill. Management wanted to transform the job to taking phone calls all day which nobody liked. We also were required to take senior customer service calls. Senior customer service’s job is to speak to angry customers all day long and resolve their problems. Once we were required to be trained in senior customer service, I decided to leave.

Another big problem is that there is no room for advancement. I had several interviews over the years, and nothing ever materialized. If a job is posted at Apple, they will typically get hundreds of applicants. If the job is decent, they will already know who they want to hire.
The only way to typically advance in RCC is if you want to become a manager. This is not a good job since you will be managing unhappy people. Apple also touts rotations as a great opportunity, and very few people ever get hired into another department. A rotation is when you go work in a different department and do a different job. However, you don’t get paid more, and you have to learn a new job. Most of the time, people never get hired and have to go back to their old position. Rotations last from a few months to a year. 

Woke Culture is very common at Apple. The old adage of staying away from politics and religion is not observed at Apple. You will receive emails about what Apple stands for and how diverse they are. At Apple is okay to have a sticker or shirt saying you support a Democrat candidate, but if you do that for a Republican candidate your days will be numbered. To be Woke, people would usually wear their BLM’s shirts at Zoom meetings. As I said, this is acceptable at Apple since this supports left-wing politics. 

Also, benefits have been cut over the years. Used to sick time was uncapped and then it was capped to 240 hours a few years ago. I also had for many years no deductible on my medical insurance and had to pay a copayment of 30 dollars. But a few years ago, Apple decided to charge a 300 dollar deductible on my medical insurance plan.

","Retail is treated horribly compared to the corporate level. The amount of opportunities provide for retail are minuscule compared to corporate. They give you these “experiences” but don’t provide the pay that should go with those “experiences”. There is no work life balance at all. No matter how much they say there is. The pay is good compared to most retail, but still not as good as it should be for the work they force you to do.
Advice to Management
Actually listen to your employees. Maybe there wouldn’t be so many people trying to leave if there where some changes. Not surface changes. Stop with the favoritism and bias going on. Especially when it comes to promotions and reviews.

The pay is pretty good.
","You will be verbally and emotionally abused by customers on a regular basis. 

It is worse if you work for them over the phone. If you're in-store, your teammates may be able to assist you when it happens. They may also not be able to if they're busy, which they often will be. Either way, you'll have to swallow it.

If you can handle that, and don't care about working for an ethically confused technology company valued at above the total GDP of some countries, then enjoy your new career.
Advice to Management
Reconsider the nature of the roles your front-line workers fulfill. Do not treat them like sacrificial lambs, thrown to the fire in an attempt to appease/court the ever-elusive Positive Customer Experience. Follow through on the concept that you seem to recognize, though only ever half-commit to, which is that the people who work for Apple are valuable; if you genuinely feel that way, you'd trust them with the responsibility to advocate for themselves personally during negative customer interactions without fear of managerial backlash.

Advice to Management
Hire better managers. If a manager doesn't like someone's personality regardless of their numbers or if they're doing everything by code, they will go above and beyond to make sure one's life is harder than need be. If you're going to boast letting people's originality shine through, actually do so.

• Working remotely on occasion is permitted
• Vacation time can be rolled over year-to-year up to a maximum of 30 days

","• Corporate policies prevent you from publishing any code you write (even off the clock), distributing any apps (on any platform), or even helping out with open-source projects (including your own) without explicit written permission
• Full-time remote work is not permitted without an SVP-signed exemption, which is only ever granted for either highly valuable employees or those with disabilities

2021-08-15, Technical Expert,"Manalapan, NJ","Former Employee, more than 3 years",Job at Apple,"Apple gave me the opportunity to meet people, get trained in the retail store taking mobile service reservations, Great culture of family in the store. good pay, stock purchase plan and 401k. I did some of the best work of my life there. Learned to speak to customers, document their issue, diagnose their problem and set them up for success with a software fix or a hardware repair. I was certified to do phone repairs, Learned how to do all modular repairs on any iphone from 5s to current 12 pro. The day felt like it was always moving.
","Your development is really based on you and what you make of it, You get an hourly pay and no matter how much extra effort you put in, sometimes you are recognized for it, other times it goes completely missed. Need to tell a lot of stories and recall interactions with customers for devolpment purposes. It seems like everything was very structured in a problem action result format. I was trying to go for genius, job opened up 3x and I interviewed 3 times.. every job I went for before this I skilled the interview, they hold the genius position to such a high standard because you get mac certifications... many people after some experience with genius leave for a better job. Seems like the best story tellers get the better jobs, very focused on inclusion and diversity. Sucks when you see qualified technicians denied and the not so great ones get the job based off of story telling. After being there for 2.5 years I felt stuck. I decided to resign. Durring covid I was greatful to not lose my job but many of us were forced into call center style work from home, my mental health suffered and everyone around me was struggling too, the call center training was a joke and the whole job was almost forced on us because at a point many of us wanted to come back to the retail store and were not able to, some were fortunate to be able to come back, but nearly loosing their job. others quit, others possibly got fired. my apple store was a shoe box in a dying mall. my store had no windows just a lot of people, always reaching capacity limits pre covid and after covid. Many store employees were offered experiences in corporate.. they did not get a pay raise for the work they did, they were only able to say they had the experience adding value to a resume.. could be a good thing, but many people did not make more money for the extra value they were giving.

The AAPL stock has one of the highest weighting in the Nasdaq 100, DJI, S&P 500 and Russell 1000 indexes. Many portfolio managers have this stock in their arsenal. Despite the sluggish performance over the past two years, this stock is still have huge base of loyal investors who still believe in the ""rising of the fallen star"".

Can Apple stock recover from its bad performance and start to shine on the market or Apple's time is over and it will be just an ordinary stock? Below are some cons and pros to consider with respect to the Apple future:
","For the past 5 years the Apple is following the other technology companies. It does not create anything new. It is not a leader in the technology industry any more.
With all due respect, the current company's management does not have a vision for the company's future. With loss of Steve Jobs the company lost it. The company may need new management, new leaders who can look into the future.

Life learning is more important than the daily KPI.
Work is left at work and during covid or illness, you are still paid for not working.
Company stock scheme via salary sacrifice is really useful!
","Such a confidential place to work with so much monitoring of communication, you can very easily offend people or find yourself trapped. Youre graded so deeply and emotionally that you find yourself growing in the company for extremely little gain and being really mentally caught up on it.

Full-timers have to be available to work 7 days a week and Part-timers have to be available to work 4 days a week and always Weekends.
Advice to Management
Blatant communication with those who ask for it in order to not waste their time or offend them with plastic speech. Head nodding is not empathy and just because there is so much data to prove a point, doesn't mean you should refer to it in every human to human conversation.

Management is amazing compared to other places I have worked at, however, I wish that I received more insight to what is exceeding the expectations of the role. It would be ideal for managers to know the role before they deliver a performance review in order to accurately provide the merit increase. Sometimes the role/team gets little support.

2021-08-05, Retail Sales Associate,,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",Good experience overall,Great company. Cares about their employees. Good benefits. Managers work really hard to serve their teams. Need Up-ish energy to work here. ,"ant training and working on improving yourself. Good starting pay for retail. You will always be challenged to improve at Apple, so do not work there if you are at a place in your life where pushing to improve daily and lots of change will stress you. They are exceptional with inclusion. Respect is the expectation.
Cons
Worked there during COVID shut down 2020, so the hours were erratic and lots of jumping to different roles. Sometimes the communication for SOPs between managers could've been better. There is subtle pressure to be ""up"" about everything - more than is realistic for actual humans, so it can be a bit fake.
Still - overall a good experience. If you don't NEED full time hours to pay bills, it's a good place to work. If you need FT, forget it. You will wait years.
Advice to Management
Also, they do a lot of role play for trainings, which many people don't learn from. It's been shown that group planned ""plays"" teach with greater retention for RL scenarios, so why use the dated role play thing? It stresses people out and comes from dated (c1980s) training methods that were lazy. Give managers better tools.

","The company itself is a society, it has good and bad people. This department is micromanaging everyone who works in the US (not if you're in Europe). Once it's unclear whether employees should fulfill business needs or manager needs, this team headed in the wrong direction. 

Folks were then encouraged to not challenge themselves and may get recommended to another group if a manager was pleased. If you don't know how to lick shoes, you can still find an ideal spot to position yourself and stay invisible for years. And small groups are everywhere, working hard can bring you heavier tasks so it's more important to find the right group. The best part among the worst in this place is people, you have chances to know various talents who don't care about this job but are also searching for the next stop to get off the train.

The dpt is constantly cutting its budget so compare to the past, folks get no bonus meals or treats during overtime or holiday seasons. Pays are lowered but your work efficiency is calculated and measured every second.

2021-08-02, Specialist,"Williamsburg, VA","Former Employee, more than 5 years",too corporate,"Discounts, cool co-workers, part time was fairly flexible. Glassdoor is making write a minimum of 20 words lol for Pro's so i'm just continuing to type even though there weren't that many Pro's. Every 3 years you get a computer for like $500. If your 22 and you work here part time for two or three years, thats fine, but seriously don't stay too long, the job will rot your mind.

Apple knows the employees have a high turnover rate (80%) within a year. They know the employees don't enjoy the work or the job or the corporate BS. They plan on you quitting after one year, and just hiring a bunch of new naive young people. They prey on people getting burnt out, and fresh blood coming in. That is the wrong attitude for a corporation. They love young people who don't know that the job sucks yet. I was really upset when I realized they lied to me. They take you to hotel ballroom to train and really brainwash you that this is going to be the best experience of your life and I was too young to know any better. The job sucks. I would only recommend working there if you are 22 and need a computer and want to put Apple on your resume. Get out after a year. Seriously. for your mental health.
","Work/Life balance was always a fight. stupid 8am meetings on sundays or trainings. they were always scheduling dumb brainwashing meetings. 
I was part time (full time will make you want to leave) and even at part time there were all these dumb requirements which you had to work certain days and times, even though there were 200 employees. 

i had eight managers. all of them telling me different things. way too many corporate speech. One time i was late due to a personal emergency and manager said ""We need to protect our customer experience"" and admonished me.

What about protecting your employee experience?

They were always trying to brainwash us to love apple. Pump up meeting with fake enthusiasm. the management invented a word ""Grustle"" which meant grind & hustle. 

The best managers were always the ones who were promoted within Apple. they understood what i was like to be an entry level employee.

Then they started outsourcing and bringing Managers in from Macy's and Sephora and Best Buy and they were always the worst. 

Apple pretends to ""enrich the world"" but at the end of the day it was about numbers and goals and selling their stupid applecare, which was usually never worth it.
Advice to Management
The Managers treat the employees like cogs. Some are cool. But most treated us like robots/vending machines for iphones. Only once or twice in four years did a manager ever ask me a question about what I do outside of work.

Act like you care (or do) about your employees. be a human. stop trying so hard to get promoted so you can have your own Apple store. That will come if you are just a great manager.

2021-07-28, Genius Administrator,"Houston, TX","Former Employee, more than 3 years",Decent retail job,"As far as retail jobs go, this isn't the worst one out there. The pay is (or at least once was) competitive, and the company offers a lot of perks for workers, such as healthcare (even for some PT employees), a 401k, ongoing training and mentoring, tuition reimbursement, different avenues for specialization, etc. Several of my former coworkers went on to work for Apple corporate, usually at the encouragement of their managers who recognized their talent and interest in certain aspects of the business and helped them get to where they wanted to go.
","The customers are either borderline-cultish Apple fans or completely unreasonable. Of course, there are those who fall in between, but those two groups were nightmares to deal with on a daily basis, especially in a fast-paced environment.

In my time there (about four years), the standards for hiring went from being highly selective to just needing bodies to fill the sales floor. The company was growing rapidly and the retail workforce was struggling to keep up with demand. Hiring sprees filled the stores with employees who likely would not have been hired back in the heyday of Apple retail, which seemed to make existing employees' jobs more difficult rather than less so.

With that, wages and salaries decreased, along with raises and promotions. At the same time, Apple was constantly in the news about how many billions of dollars they were making and then spending on this, that, and the other, yet the employees were seeing little of it.

Management also dwindled in quality, as those promoted into leadership positions were mediocre, at best.

The culture, training, and opportunities that will be presented to you in a 2-4 year career in retail can rapidly accelerate you onwards and upwards.

I was lucky enough to be able to go on a career experience after two years in retail and it absolutely opened doors for me. If you can find a good team, with solid management -- the pay, benefits, and perks are awesome.
","Retail management will often lose sight of the appeal of Apple, and what makes Apple, Apple. As with all performance-based roles, the tendency of management (especially with not a lot of Apple tenure) to lean into the numbers game can be frustrating.

Focus on providing a great service to your customers, and learn as much as you can. Don't let the managers get to you about scorecards and performance. Your actions and patience will absolutely be testing by the biggest Karen's known to man, but you can perservere.

Learn everything you can.
Be a sponge.
Springboard this opportunity into something big.

DON'T lean into work politics, drama, or the 'high-school' side of the store. (Often in lower volume stores...this is product zone.)
Be an expert, even in a entry-level position. Know your $H#t, do your work, don't stand around on your phone or gossip with your coworkers. Leaders will recognize this and move you fast. Show you're hungry, and you will go far.
Advice to Management
My store lost a lot of good people very rapidly due to poor management and a collapse on the original store culture I was hired with. Hang on to the good ones. My management failed to realize a lot of the aging (meaning older han 25) talent was preparing to jump ship and incentivized new and younger employees to fill gaps when they obviously weren't ready. This led to a complete collapse of people who took pride in their work and an influx of people who showed up for a paycheck and didn't take their work seriously. The quality of the store drastically dropped and our GM was noticably absent MONTHS out of the year, disappearing to Florida several times, seemingly completely out of the loop when returning to store, and their underlings were unprepared and unmotivated to step up to managing the store in her absence.

","With today's paradigm changes (post-COVID) not clear support for remote working. Some jobs do not translate to a remote environment.

Wish there was more support for advancement into corporate positions. Sometimes past, pre-Apple experience is not included in the narrative when applying to current corporate positions. It's important to do very well at your current position however, there are occasions when a current position is less relevant than some past experience which is presented in the job descriptions of current corporate openings.
Advice to Management
The soft skills gained/used in a current Apple position should stand out more than hard skills that aren't as relevant to some corporate openings. On rare occasions, the hard skills from a past experience may be a better fit. Leaders should get to know their team a little more in order to confidently support candidates beyond the lens of what they see day-to-day.

Great discounts on Apple Products and Third Party Accessories. The most diverse work environment. Staff members come from diverse ethnical backgrounds and ages. Work coaching. Career development plan. Continuous paid training time. Good break room. Culture of feedback.
","Best internal work opportunities are given to expert workers or to anyone who is close friends with management team members. This stalls and frustrates employees with neutral friendship with lead team members. It's very difficult to over achieve work performance which stalls your annual raise. Some managers are in their position mainly because they've worked many years before in another retail store. Some managers are not people oriented as they favour employees they personally are friends with or hang out with. Your work experience and personal successes achieved outside Apple are not considered when applying for lead positions internally. Only internal work experience seems to count when applying for new work positions. Management team is almost fully caucasian. It's extremely rare to see a manager of colour (black, eastern Indian, Asian of colour, or Latino). Managers in most stores do not ethnically represent the diverse ethnical pool of employees working on the floor.

Expert or pro employees already get paid well and have better benefits than most. Please offer new expert or lead opportunities to base level specialists so they can feel motivated and grow too.

The colleges are very knowledgeable.

A lot of work to take on.
","Management promotes unsocial environment
Combining with zero social activities for the hardware department (Unlike the software) and the amount of work, the workday is very lonesome. (Yes, before COVID)

The Management is bad at valuing tasks, they often demand something at an unreasonable time. (Caused because they are under pressure/ don’t get involved enough to value correctly)

Career opportunities are very rarely an option. You must do 3-4 years to even consider moving.

Everything is a secret, even the chip you are working on.. for 2 years I didn’t know what product I’m working on. Everyone in the floor kitchen is afraid to speak about what he does because this is the company culture.. again very unsociable habit.

Advice to Management
Please retire. Too many old guards blocking careers. Should cap the amount of time a leader can be in one position. e.g 5 years. Some leaders are way too comfortable and have lost their innovation, impacting their own work, and their ability to attract and retain innovative talent.

Listen to your employees more often. They're not being 'lazy' when they tell you that you're causing them to stress themselves into medical problems. Multiple people in my class alone ended up having issues with stress, wrist injuries, etc due to the pace of work there.

Advice to Management
Apple retail is a garbage, thankless dead end job with no career path for most. Unless your career aspiration is to be a manager. My experience has been management being afraid to give bad news, or simply not saying anything and evidently hoping you’ll just leave them alone. My advice to management would be to grow some courage. Courage to do your whole job and not just the part where you exercise your authority. That goes for the “leads” as well.

2021-07-16, Specialist,"Jacksonville, FL","Former Employee, more than 3 years",Drink the Kool-Aid,"You get to meet customer’s from all over the world, and you also learn so much about technology. It’s also nice if your under 35 because everyone is around the age so you can easily make friends and meet some great people. Great enviornment to form connections with the variety of customers. You work with a diverse group of people compared to other places. Different people are good at different things. (Music, Art, Tech, etc) Apple discounts are nice, especially the $500 off with the 25% that you get every 2-3 years. It’s pretty easy to get time-off because there are so many employees and they weren’t super strict on call out’s. Also, weird fact. I noticed people had a cold in the store pretty often. I would assume this is because you are interacting with thousands of people a week. I got sick more working there than I ever had in my life.
","Takes like 3-5 interviews to get hired. If you drink the Apple Kool-Aid you will be promoted. The politics are pretty horrible. The people who work hard don’t get promoted but the lazy ones do. It’s almost impossible to become full-time. Scheduling is pretty tough. You will always work weekends. It’s almost impossible not to because most times that is the busiest. The turn around rate is pretty high, new employees were coming in and out. This is managers included. They all quit and were replaced. There are high expectations and no bonuses considering you can make millions youself for the company in a year. The favorites move up and around more than others. Playing favorites is HEAVY.

Try to work with your employees to find schedule solutions and try to get to know your workers more. People will rally behind you when you know you’re in their corner. Only one manager knew what I did outside of work, two managers didn’t even know my name after 5+ months of being there.

2021-07-09, AppleCare Partner Relations Advisor,,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",Great entry level position,"If you are seeking to break into a well-known large corporation, starting as AHA (At Home Advisor) is a great way to get your foot in the door while you figure out what you want to do career-wise. 

Partner Relations Advisor supposed to be a B to B client management role, however, this truly is a call center job. 

Internal movement is very limited for AHA employees not resides near actual corporate functions offices. 

Overall I gained valuable lessons and was satisfied with pay/benefit for what the job was. Left the company for better opportunity.

Pros:
- Pay was above average for call center type settings
- You can put Apple on your resume
- You can familiarize yourself with OS system
- Internal opportunities (Rotations, career exchange, etc)



If you enjoy heavily metric driven and process oriented environment, go for it! At the end of the day, Apple is Apple. Great way to start building your career.
","Cons:
- Limited internal opportunities if you don't live near Apple offices
- AHA really isn't a long term career
- No holidays
- Call center = angry clients
- Metric driven: Average call time, email time, contents, calls are all monitored and measured at all times
- Supervisor will critique your calls and emails randomly 3-4 times /month and you get rated

","The work/life balance in the at home positions is terrible. Apple claims they care about their employees, which might be true for higher up corporate employees but not employees at this level. Every six months there is a shift bid, and you have virtually no say in your schedule. Apple comes first and that is it, “too bad” is basically what I’ve been told before when discussing scheduling. I would have loved this job if I had even a little bit of a say in my schedule.

Advice to Management
If you want to see yourself as a progressive employer, you must fix the work/life balance problems you currently allow to fester on too many R&D teams. When so many R&D job postings say ""must be able to thrive in a fast-paced, demanding environment"", that's your employees warning job seekers that management doesn't care about this.

","The company is very ""woke"", so meetings can get quite political and you are expected to agree with their views. They are constantly overhearing your conversations with clients to give you feedback and they keep checking how much Apple care you sell. They expect you to push Apple care as much as you can and have good numbers in order to get promotions.

The customers, management, and coworkers really made it such a positive experience for me!
","Can be long hours and sometimes have to work overtime because people call out. But that's almost any job. And with great coworkers and managers it makes the time fly by. You do get rude customers from time to time and ones who aren't too happy when you make an error. But you get over it.
Advice to Management
Though I know you need the manpower, respect employees days off as they need to recharge. It sucks always having to think of an excuse when they call and I'm at home or out relaxing on my day off. Dealing with customers nonstop especially at Apple can be draining on a weekend for example.

","At the end of the day, if you work for the Apple Store, you work in retail. This means working an inconsistent work schedule, your requested time off will be declined a lot more often than other jobs, and other troublesome issues that come alongside a retail job.

","Company does not value quality over efficiency, and often work of colleagues can reflect poorly on you based on their system - the customer may speak with 3 representatives before they get to you but if you are the last one they speak to about their issue no matter how well you handle the situation any potential negative feedback is seen as a reflection on you. No job security, the company would rather hire and train new employees than keep good staff, I watched many of my good colleagues be left go despite great stats. False sense of community.

Leadership and inter-personal skills are a focus and will level up even if you don't think about it. The people Apple hires in my experience tend to be really fun and nice to work with.
","At the end of the day, the company puts the interests of the company first, before its employees, though that isn't too surprising or unheard of these days.
Managers/those in leadership roles can tend to get too wrapped up in ""being Apple"" about things and forget they are talking to a human being.
While employees tend to be fun to work with, in big cities they tend to hire young (early - mid 20's) - in my experience the younger employees could sometimes forget to distinguish between work and personal relationships

","Where to begin...There are 2345253 people working on 3 projects. Everything is slow, there is no innovation and when you do work on cool projects, they get cancelled at the last minute. Leadership is lacking in Marcom. I had such high hopes of working here but was so let down by the culture and leadership. Marcom leadership doesn't know what they're doing and maybe that's because they don't have to? What makes Apple special is their design and products, not the marketing. Inexperienced leadership was the biggest letdown. I'm sure they are trying their best but it's amateur hour and to top it off they're not very welcoming to new team members. I'm glad I took the job and have it on my resume, but I don't think I would recommend working here in marketing to an enemy.
Advice to Management
Everything you're doing in Marcom is not working. Go through some leadership training! You really need it! Acknowledge new team members, build a culture so people stop jumping ship. Listen! Ask questions! Try!

","Very low salary for industry standard of SMB account management and they offer no incentive program to do a better job other than ""you could add head count for your team."" Meanwhile, I am selling hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of equipment for them and increasing our revenue gains quarter over quarter consistently. I once asked my manager for a raise and he said ""if you are just here for the money than you shouldn't be here,"" they act like they are a charity instead of paying my salary.
Advice to Management
Raise the salary for your SMB Account Management team and add a cash/stock bonus for exceeding goals set at the beginning of the quarter.

","The company sustains ""At Apple, you own your own development!"" and that is 100% true. If you do not push yourself forward and ""sell yourself"" you could stay in the same position for years. Few or rare are the occasion that someone promotes you also if you are the best employee of the year. 
It can be quite competitive as well.
It has sometimes a super structured interview process even for changing just the working hours.

Product discounts and sometimes discounts are available for employees on third-party products. Beer bashes are great to attend if you're located near the corporate offices in Cupertino.
","Depending on management it can be an immature and backbiting place to work. The iPhone sales process can often be confusing. There's not a lot of time on the clock allotted to come up to speed with new products/processes. You're expected to be gun-ho about the products and the company at all times. Many promotions are based on popularity rather than skill, but hey, this happens everywhere. Values statements contradict practices.

They literally made illegal decisions regarding this issue and Fair Work advised that I wasnt eligible because of the type of company they are registered as in Australia.

Advice to Management
Working for Apple is changing for the worse, and you can see the company losing its edge, becoming a sales/numbers driven mentality which makes the company no different than any other company. Apple's philosophy prior was that providing a great experience would lead to great numbers. It's now only about selling iPhones and attachments across all store areas.

2021-06-16, College Advisor,"Phoenix, AZ",Former Employee,"Amazing internal culture, challenging-but-draining work","If I'd could, I'd rate Apple 3.5 stars. 

• Great benefits & healthcare. 
• College students are given more room to make mistakes, but the expectation is that even college students should eventually perform on the same level as regular employees
• Team Managers are deeply invested in helping struggling employees become better at their roles
• Apple generally wants all employees to feel as if they have autonomy within the company; many opportunities to offer feedback on company tools
• Senior Leaders is accessible to basic employees
• Good discounts on Apple Product & services
• AppleCare College specifically gives students the ability to schedule around their classes

Not-pros-but-not-cons

Generally inclusive environment (but it's only the best you can hope for in corporate America, as a transgender employee I was often left having to explain my struggles to people who didn't really act upon anything beyond saying ""check our benefits"").

Apple offers 'rotations' to other corporate positions, which let employees in one role temporarily migrate to another branch of the company to learn new skills & see another side of the business. From all the rotations I was offered, strangely, I was offered a rotation to ""Tier 2 AppleCare"". While it was functionally another side of the business, it was really the same as my Tier 1 role with more responsibility, pressure, & room for failure. There was no pay-raise, no promise of promotion, beyond that ""it will look great on a resume"". I don't regret taking the Tier 2 position, but I wish there was better compensation than promises.

AppleCare is a demanding job. You're not just troubleshooting software & hardware, you're quite literally trying to solve people's perceived emotional problems with their technology. Apple is invested in ensuring customers feel that their technology isn't a problem, & sometimes you're having to de-escalate emotional issues. Some customers make this challenging.

Performance metrics are micromanaged, but certain metrics matter more than others. Most Team Managers I had assessed me on my own merits, quirks, & shortcomings, but each manager had different points of concern.
","• Non-stop work, draining & hard to remain at peak performance through long shifts
• Work is super challenging, lots to internalize, learn, remember, & actively use. You cannot coast through this job
• Easy to get lost & forgotten among the thousands of employees
• Limited career advancement from within AppleCare
• Networking opportunities are extremely difficult, as there are limited chances to really speak to coworkers
• At-home work environment can be incredibly isolating

Maybe it was my College position, but advancing the ranks within Apple seemed labyrinthine, & I wasn't ever able to get clear answers on how advancement worked. I was generally an average employee, with middle-of-the road stats. I imagined if I tried harder, I could get a generally idea of how advancing to leadership positions within AppleCare or Apple Corporate worked, but that nobody really bothered to tell me in my 4 years made me feel small & forgotten. I was also so absorbed in school that I imagine Apple reserved advancement opportunities for regular employees.

Apple partners with a 3rd party company to help provide college tuition reimbursement, but from 2017-2021 it required students to make B's or higher in their courses. I was never able to make these goals, as it was my fault. I lost access to the key to making college manageable for me.

","Apple sources employees from legally separate entities, even for entirely internal facing, badged, on-campus employees. This creates a second-class tier of worker that is excluded from investment and benefits provided to other members on your team doing the same type of work.

I can only imagine this is done in order to prevent worker organization, and make it easier to hire and fire people indirectly and avoid responsibilities to what should be employees. Additionally, they sneakily cut pay rates to vendors after you’ve accepted the job, and as they’re making record profits to boot.

Medical, dental, and vision coverage available even to part-time employees. Other perks like employee discounts, commuter benefits, fitness reimbursement, and some mental health support coverage. Usually good diversity amongst staff and leadership. Great place to develop customer service and basic technical troubleshooting skills.
","Considering it's a trillion dollar company, they still undervalue most retail employees. If you don't want to become a manager, paths for upward mobility in retail are limited and even the more senior roles for sales, tech support, operations, and other teams are underpaid. There are a lot of metrics and sometimes unrealistic goals set as performance indicators. In other words, when you try to emphasize everything as important, then nothing is important.
Advice to Management
Pay retail employees more. So many things are good or almost good about working at Apple, but I think retention would be higher if people felt like they could sustain themselves long-term working on the retail side. Hire more managers, leadership is usually trying their best, but they are spread too thin to truly support staff in most stores and keep up with the seemingly endless priorities corporate sets for us. Let part-timers accumulate PTO. Everyone deserves time off without stressing about their bills. Use our money and influence to truly be about our values and not just at the surface level.

","-Pay can be good depending on your group. Some are paid crazy good, others are thrown peanuts. 
-Culture is becoming very clickish and more focus is on diversity and inclusion, however, they do not listen to employee needs like they should. Good case in point, Sr. leadership mandating work days in office as part of hybrid model without any thought to how it would affect employees. 
-No surveys were do to ask employees what their needs are, just told what to do and suck it up.
Advice to Management
-LISTEN TO YOUR PEOPLE!!!! There are a LOT of unhappy folks right now and you are loosing talent left and right because you are not listening. For god's sake, take a survey, listen to what people's needs are and do your best to adapt to them. Your employees make the business and when you do not listen to them and treat them poorly they will not support you anymore, hence Apple's business declines.

Lots of time restriction that you will have to schedule bathroom breaks. There are always extra hours of work; however, the pay is not that great. There are other companies in Austin who are willing to pay a minimum of 45k a year where Apple doesn't do that. (Most IT companies in Austin pay 50-55k starting salaries). You will only enjoy the events that Apple has if you are in another department. You are usually given the option to apply as a Senior Advisor after 1 year with no pay increase as you increase skills within products too. It's a call center in a fancy building!

","It’s hard to grow within Apple. Not only is there a waiting list of people that have been there before you for 5+ years but they like to hold a new position over your head called an “experience”. Pretty much they place you in a new role for 6 months without a pay raise and then once that experience is over you go back to your same role in the beginning even if you excelled at the job title. Causes friction in the work place.

I met and worked for some of the best humans i've ever met- and will always be thankful for that....although I know everyone is not so lucky- the company generally attracts great talent. 
The perfect job for younger aged people looking to develop leadership and business skills. Also great for retired-aged employees looking for a great social environment.
Pay is the most competitive you will find in a retail environment. Benefits are solid, and stock options are widely available and generally included in all offers.
","Some dangling of the carrot, some repetitive daily/Weekly/quarterly mechanisms with minimal benefit long term. On the tech side- the Genius role is a ceiling I hit, with only Management roles opening up after. After 5 years, I jumped to a corporate position elsewhere to explore further career and development goals as well as higher pay tiers.

Managers don’t care about employees work satisfaction. Most people you work with here are extremely arrogant because of the brand and founder reputation even though they are not the smartest kind . Mediocre work and salaries. No one cares about your career growth or your well-being , all they care is you keep the labor on . 
Many folks esp. those who have stayed here for most part of their career would tell you that this is the ‘ultimate place to work’ , but they have been brainwashed over the years and have been made to believe that their work is central to the uplifting of human race. They slog without complain , few don’t buy into this and quit quietly .

","Dealing with ambiguity is a skill that most successful Apple employees have, but too much ambiguity leads to a level of dissatisfaction when it comes to knowing what’s next regarding development and job opportunities. Communication amongst and from leadership could be improved. It is a sad reality that there is little diversity in management across all of Apple. The company is definitely trying to make some changes in their approach to hiring inclusively, but there is so much unconscious and implicit bias to work through that this may take another 5–10 years for real change to happen from entry level to executive roles.

2021-06-01, Technical Specialist,"Little Rock, AR","Former Employee, more than 3 years",I mean,"Apple is a great company to want to work for! It thrives in innovation and the discounts provided, you cannot beat. The way Apple trains you is top tier. I've taken what I've learned at Apple in other job roles. They really do care about their customers and finding the best solutions for them.
","Moving up is hard, especially in retail. In my store, the people that were mostly promoted were ""yes man"" or people with little to no opinion. Also, few minorities were promoted. I've been told by mgmt time and time again it's a game. You have to play the game. No work environment should be like that. Time off is a whole other topic. Mgmt would be passive-aggressive when it came to you needing time off or in my experience, I was in school too. Managing work and school balance sometimes my mental would suffer and instead of being understanding, Mgmt would try and make you feel bad. Raises? Good Luck! Quarter raises would be maybe an extra dollar or two and they would expect you to be so excited! Wow, a whole $1.30 after 4 years and exceeding expectations. I mean, if you can look past all these factors, you will enjoy your experience.
Advice to Management
Having round tables with stores would be great and allow your team to express real concerns! My store leader provided that and although no real change happened, the thought of other stores following suit could really provide change with those conversations being documented and given to corporate. If patterns are found in other stores then maybe real change can occur. Create a safe space for your minorities. It's a lack in that department.

2021-05-29, AppleCare Senior Advisor,,"Former Employee, more than 5 years",Good but not a long term career unless you’re okay with very slow career growth,"For some background: I started in the college program working part-time as an Mac+ Advisor for 2.5 years. After graduating, I was offered a full-time position and immediately promoted to iOS Senior Advisor role. I worked as an iOS Senior Advisor for 2 years. I had the opportunity to temporarily be a Mac+ mentor for newly trained advisors making their first every calls with customers and work in a retail store repairing iOS devices. Right before I was about to leave the company, I was offered to laterally move to Mac+ Senior Advisor. I consistently ranked top 5%-10% in average metrics amongst all company-wide Advisors.

The pay was good for what the job entailed when comparing to other companies.

You get a wide variety of customers, making it pretty interesting day-to-day.

I definitely learned how to be patient with people and how to keep your cool even if someone is berating you.

Apple definitely sets you up for success when it comes to providing you the resources to perform your job properly. There’d be some situations where there wasn’t actually any documented process for certain situations, but I can’t blame the company for that since those situations were fairly rare.
","During my time with the company, it was clear that as internal advisors were leaving, the company was filling those positions with contractors. These contractors usually never really actually fixed issues properly and that would cause customers to repeatedly call back for same issues. What this meant to me is that Senior Advisors were primarily there to clean up contractors’ mistakes and “win” the customer back.

Frequent management and team changes happened every year, sometimes even multiple times a year for some. This made it difficult to make any lasting relationships with co-workers as well as when it was already difficult to do so in a remote setting. I had 5 different managers with 4 completely different teams within a 4.5 year span. 

Most managers were not very technical and when they review your performance, they mostly look at the metrics and how much you contributed to the company as a whole (kind of hard when the manager has only worked with you for a year or less).

Once you get to Senior Advisor role, it’s fairly clear that if you want to promote to anything else, you have to drink the Apple Juice and be a “puppet” for management for a few years. Even then, chances are very minimal as the competition is extremely high regardless of how consistently high your annual review/metrics are.

In the end, this is a customer service job, not a technical job. I’m definitely a more technical person and regardless of how technical you are and how well you are at resolving issues, management won’t recognize it since you ultimately are just number for them amongst a huge pool of customer service employees. Yes, Apple provides possible paths to a more technical position within AppleCare, but even then, it is very difficult to get there with opportunities being limited. The ones that got there in the first place after starting as an advisor were with the company for more than 6-8 years back when the company wasn’t as large as it is today. Once I realized this, I didn’t want to spend most of my young career years trying to get noticed at a lower level position of a major tech company.

","There are so many. You have no set schedule, they don't want you to use your time off or disability leave, they don't allow time to not be offline with customers. They want empathetic people on the phones, but then don't care about your mental health. They are taking away all down-time. They make chat advisers take multiple customers at once, while also having to escalate and investigate- multitasking just means everything is done half way. Micromanagement is extreme. Currently some idiot decided that advisors should be experts in all departments, which is impossible, and there are people having nervous breakdowns at their desks. Crying on the phone with customers. Literally killing themselves from the stress. No proper training at any level in AppleCare. It's a really terrible environment, and it didn't used to be like this.

","If you are a person who have a problem with a lot of changes then this isn’t the company for you. Your leaders will push you for better. However some people just don’t like change. It’s hard to network if you work from home and sometimes your schedule is a bummer because you have to bid based on your metrics. Schedule changes twice a year so flexibility can also be a con. If you are thinking about working from home you have to have discipline. Have a schedule for work and have a schedule for home. Also if you are the type of people who have to be in an office environment you might struggle.
Advice to Management
Listen to your advisors. The ones who truly make a difference with the company. Off more flexibility with Level 3 Advisors when it comes to opportunities. Challenge them. Sometimes they get so caught up with just working cases, taking calls that they forget their value.

","Functional technical experience can be very limited. Training quality is not as high as in prior years. Annual/cost of living increases are low and eventually a technician’s skill set and gained experience makes them more valuable than the company will acknowledge. Not a place to have a true career. Management quality varies dramatically and your direct manager will change frequently. Hours are rough, and you will sometimes feel overworked.
Advice to Management
The really effective and supportive managers do not always rise to the top; listen to employees when they tell you who those managers are and actively try to learn from them. It makes an enormous difference. Find and address the staff that create negative energy among their peers, one person can break down the culture of an entire team. Encourage burnt out employees by finding an area where their skills can still grow and letting them spend part of their time doing that - attitudes and productivity will improve.

","- This varies by store but management at retail level was generally clueless and not eager to help.
- “dealing with ambiguity” is constantly used as an excuse for complete lack of communication.
- Corporate uses retail employees to have them do high-paying jobs for the same pay rate as their current position. They expect the same skill level as people who make over 100k a year for what is essentially an internship and disguise that as a career opportunity.

The benefits are top quality.
They try to be very flexible.
Inclusion is one of their top priorities.
They go above and beyond to ensure the safety of their employees.
","Change is a big part of the company culture. (can also be a positive)
Work schedule changes every three months. (can also be positive depending on situation)
If you are a home based worker, you must request and receive approval before you are able to move locations outside of a 10 mile radius due to cost of living zones. This means is your new location is a higher cost of living and would incur a wage increase then its possible that it may get rejected. Same if you were to move to a lower cost of living, it would most likely be approved, but you may not be able to move back as well as having your pay reduced.

","Cult like, as in you couldn’t make any honest criticisms about processes behind the scenes without being talked down for “being against the company culture”. 
They pay themselves on the back for being woke but when you are suffering from genuine mental health problems there’s no support unless you have a wonderful manager who can support you, outside of that you’re on your own.
There’s always the notion of “moving up” mentioned whenever there’s a chance but there’s a NO place to move up to. The few people in management aren’t going to give up those sweet work at home pay rates they’ve got for any other job. This leaves everyone else at the bottom of the ladder for their entire career unless they get out of Apple.

2021-05-14, Technician,"Nashville, TN",Current Employee,Poor Management and Poor Standards for Employees,"I have learned so much from my time at Apple. I am thankful that this job taught me many things that would be important for future job opportunities.
","Apple has failed to make the employee journey exceptional like they always promise. From the retail store all the way to HR. Many instances of reporting other employees and simply getting a slap on the wrist. Apple cares more about their customers than the mental well being of their employees. Everything is numbers based and all built off of revenue for certain areas of the company. Not a great place to spend most of your career unless you make it higher up in the company which is extremely hard to do if you're not a male.

","At the end of the day, its another corporation that finds its employees to be replaceable numbers. Everything, especially promotions, is a popularity contest. If you like to kiss-up to management, it's the perfect job for you. If you want to enter a cult-like world where everyone has to pretend they love being there, it's perfect for you. If you like being disrespected and sexually harassed by customers, it's the job for you! If you like to be gaslighted, overlooked, and also sexually harassed by the managers, it's perfect for you! When they say ""People First"", they mean the people spending money there.
Advice to Management
You will continue to lose great employees because of what you're doing. You will be the downfall of this company.

Advice to Management
Management needs to be trained and needs to work with ALL employees on day to day, and quarter to quarter work skills. Managers need to be available to guide and teach. Micro-management of calls, etc. needs to cease. More experiences like LinkedIn Learning and other voluntary coursework need to be offered. Increased Appreciation of gifts that employees have!!

","Management, at least at my store, are obsessive about metrics and prioritize AppleCare and activations over the customer's experience. They also recognize people who painting strong metric even if those employees are not transparent with customer. Very used car salesperson like.

Management can be very demanding when it comes to availability. The have had a hard time understand the workload college can bring and at times are not very accommodating with scheduled hours. They will try to work you as much as they can, even if it becomes unhealthy for you.
Advice to Management
Treat everyone equal and don't play favorites. It is almost impossible to move into a new role unless you kiss up to a manager at this store. Stop overworking employees and respect that they have other commitments like school and family. Make up your mind, are we here to help people or sell warranties? You can't preach both narratives and expect us to feel motivated or inspired.

2021-05-05,Anonymous,Cork,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",Not what you would expect,"Great benefits package overall. Great gym, amazing canteen! The stock plan is well organised and it is a good way to invest in the company.
","I am an Apple employee in Cork and I would suggest you to think twice before accepting a job in Apple Hollyhill. 

*Management*
I have to say that I have never seen such poor management. People with no merit and no qualifications are managers in finance, apple care etc...I have seen 20 year-old people becoming manager after few years of work, no school, no real experience... It is the perfect place for mediocrity!!

*Employees care*
Funny story.. Apple is making a huge amount of money during pandemic, we as employees got a 15€ taxi voucher as a Christmas ""present"" and as a thanks for our hard work during the pandemic. This is ridiculous!! 

*Work/Life Balance*
Managers (apart from AppleCare) do not respect your personal life. I have been asked why was I out sick when I took 1 day off because of my personal issues. I have been asked to log into the system and work during my Christmas holidays. 

*Inequalities*
Apple is claiming to be the perfect place to work for inclusion and diversity but the truth is that Apple is discriminating a lot. People from different departments get different benefits, for example during Covid people in AppleCare got their internet reimbursed 50€/month, but in my team (finance) we didn't get anything, 0€!! When I asked if I could go back to my home country during Covid I was told that just higher managers could do it, the rest of us has to stay in Cork and pay incredibly expensive rents and sit in house arrest.

Please be honest, instead of beating around the bush when it comes to promotions or feedback I general. Sometimes you’ll genuinely have multiple specialists who are genuinely good at what they do at almost identical rates.

","I would never recommend someone to work for the customer support of Apple. The micromanaging is relentless and they don't pay enough money for this job- maybe in other depertments. It's abusively exhausting trying to keep up with those metrics. The management is really bad. They say everything to make you feel special as an indivdual person, but they'll do everything to make you believe that you're just a number. This is a very stressful job, no matter what level you are or which language. It's shameful. They could be hiring more people and not drive everyone crazy, but they just won't do.

The kit you use and internal systems are very slick.
","Awful for work/life balance. You can start at 7:30am, and finish at 8-9pm in a 9 hour shift somewhere in that. Those days are complete write-offs.
Generally terrible management - a bunch of ex-clothes retail and hospitality people. Prejudice, favouritism, unfair treatment, open bias, leaders that stand around brazenly doing nothing on their phones, poor recognition and development of skilled people that care, bullying - basically all the things you can think of that are the last you would want leadership to be.
A toxic environment breeding negativity and apathy toward the job.
Advice to Management
Stop treating passion as negativity. You will only make these jewel employees negative and apathetic toward their duties.
Work hard at identifying the people that want to be there and champion them. You have a responsibility to look after your team, and they will look after you.
Stop promoting your favourites, and give people equal opportunities.
Be fair when dealing with disciplinaries.
Be respectful of customers - remember that employees will just mirror your behaviour.
Be respectful of your employees, and they will respect you.

Repor","Stop treating passion as negativity. You will only make these jewel employees negative and apathetic toward their duties.
Work hard at identifying the people that want to be there and champion them. You have a responsibility to look after your team, and they will look after you.
Stop promoting your favourites, and give people equal opportunities.
Be fair when dealing with disciplinaries.
Be respectful of customers - remember that employees will just mirror your behaviour.
Be respectful of your employees, and they will respect you.

You get to work with a lot of tech and learn a lot about business practices.

Team leaders are easy to find and easy to talk to. They welcome setting up meetings to talk about growth.
","The workload can get very very busy and you have to be flexible with it, which by itself isnt a problem, but they have been removing more and more of the off sites and team building activities. Especially with Covid hitting we have had less of these to look forward to. The job went from being a business sales job to taking on everything from consumer sales to customer service at the same time. With all of the extra workload and responsibilities there haven't been any rewards or incentives for the extra work and stress.

Management has little discipline and let work pile onto good workers when bad workers aren't doing their part.

Extremely slim growth and opportunity.

Advice to Management
This review is about Apple Retail. It is a fun culture to be a part of, and a great way to learn most of the ins and outs of customer service, whether you’re selling stuff or repairing stuff. However, if you’re looking for either horizontal or vertical advancement opportunities, know this: Apple Retail is indisputably a clique. Despite what the company claims, Apple Retail leadership is generally biased and whether it takes you 3 months or a year, you will eventually realize that opportunities are given mostly based on favoritism that is sometimes thinly and other times heavily disguised by a very strenuous interview process during which you are forced to go through 3, 4 or more interviews and you will usually be turned down the first time you apply for a new position (sometimes without even any constructive feedback to go off of to improve yourself for future interview processes). Personally, I started my 3-year journey with Apple Retail very enthusiastically and successfully by any measure (bonuses, MVP status, positive leadership feedback, etc.) and unfortunately ended my employment there on a very bitter note. Best of luck to you, but heed my words because they are very solid and easy to prove.

Get everyone in leadership on the same page, walk the talk of the creedo and stop being so pretentious in hiding behind the so-called “Apple juice”. Generally, just try and be more genuine and fair, it isn’t as hard as you think, and most employees would appreciate you more.

Advice to Management
There are so many people who work hard and are passionate about the culture that are looked over because they keep quiet while the whiners are given promotions. 
Do not keep your head down at Apple retail. Work hard and demand recognition or they will take advantage of you. 
Also, management and corporate have heavy expectations of retail employees learning all about their products without ever giving them the opportunity to learn about them. So many times during launch season coworkers and I would find out about a feature of the phone through a customer.

2021-04-20, AppleCare Senior Technical Advisor,"Austin, TX","Former Employee, more than 3 years","Fake Promotions, Department Mergers, and Bad Management","Apple seemed like a dream when I arrived. It was peak iPhone and the company was growing rapidly. The stock was doing well, it seemed like there was a lot of possibility to move up, and people generally had a positive attitude. New buildings were beautiful and the food was cheap and tasty.
","There was a dark side. The food got more expensive and to order it, you had to install a profile that gave Apple full access to your iPhone. Fake promotions, bad managers, rotations or ""career experiences"" for what should have been actual positions (all about saving money). Apple is good at making profit off their own employees. Product discounts were the same as educators, 25% is not great. Also, I knew 3 people who committed suicide and one guy who became jaundiced and stopped coming to work because he died. The worst part was the cold response from management. Also if you get one of those ""fake promotions,"" know that HR definitely does not have your back. A manager can actually tell you to your face during an internal interview that a position is a promotion with a raise, but then you make the move and find out it's lateral and there's no consequence for the manager who baited you with the false promise. These sorts of practices were quite common for me and others and it seemed most were happy to put up with it because it was Apple and they didn't know better. Always ask the position and number when you interview, get as much in writing as possible, and realize that a positive performance review will not equate to an increase in pay despite the company's cash situation. The kool-aid is strong here, so keep things in perspective. You are a number. You are disposable. If you give 2 weeks notice, that's actually your final day.

2021-04-18, Global Supply Manager,"Cupertino, CA","Former Employee, more than 1 year","Impossible Expectations, High Stress, Hostile Colleagues","- Decent pay and bonus, but not competitive with the market when breaking it down by the hour
-cool campus,
- you will learn a lot, although it is not worth the sacrifices you will make
","Apple is undoubtedly one of the most innovative companies on the tech hardware market today, but what people don’t realize is what employees of Apple sacrifice in order to obtain this innovation for the company. While many departments within Apple have a good work life balance and receive compliments from management, the supply chain and purchasing department of Apple is the complete opposite. Supply chain is one of Apple’s largest competitive advantages, and you will feel the pain and burden of that every moment of every day.

The Global Supply Manager role is incredibly demanding. My day would typically start at 9:00 AM, and end around 11:00 PM, and there were multiple times that I would have calls at 2:30 AM. My management knew my hours and my stress, and instead of helping lighten the workload, they told me to, “stay optimistic”, and then several weeks later they doubled my scope of responsibilities. You will have colleagues texting you and calling you at 11:00 PM on weekdays and weekends. The only way to escape this invasive behavior is to place your phone on airplane mode, although you will get in trouble for this when you fail to answer a single text or phone call.

There are not enough hours in the day to get everything done, even if you are a Type A person who is extremely organized and productive. I should clarify that the hours are not the worst part of the job, instead, it is your colleagues who are just as nervous, tired, stressed, and angry at everything as you are. Apple encourages a very hostile environment, both internally and externally, where Global Supply Managers are encouraged to have extremely aggressive discussions with suppliers and individuals from other departments. There is no problem at Apple that cannot be solved by yelling and using condescending language. I have seen Apple employees yell at people earning a tenth of what they earn half way across the globe for problems that individual had no way of controlling. I’ve been in procurement for some time, and I have never seen people treated in such an undignified way as Apple supply chain professionals treat their suppliers and colleagues.

There is no balance in work life. If you have children or a spouse, then those relationships must be de-prioritized in place of Apple. At the end of the day, Apple will chew you up and spit you out, because no matter how loudly you voice that the expectations are not sustainable, they know that there are 30 more applicants fresh out of college who will take your place and be willing to do so for less pay. These fresh faces will then last one or two years, only to then be replaced. It is an endless cycle, and this is nothing new for Apple. Perspective employee beware. When applying for Apple, I remember reading negative reviews such as this one, and quickly disregarding them because I labeled those reviews as “overly-dramatic”, but after two weeks at Apple, I realized how true the other cautionary reviews on this website were.

","Secrecy is so tight you won't be able to talk to anyone about work. Silly disclosure system makes it extremely difficult and slow to get things done.

","Apple is a corporate office in a retail space and it definitely operates more like corporate office. Performance metrics are confusing and sometimes difficult to quantify, can feel useless at times when it comes to overall performance. Development paths are ambiguous, everyone recommends something different. 

Work Life balance isn't always the best 

Leadership is notoriously aloof, you'll need to campaign like a politician to get what you want. 

Because development is disjointed, colleague interactions can often feel artificial and micromanage-y if either parties are trying to develop skills/move up.

","Basically impossible to be fired, however, they can and will leave you in the same position with a 1% to 2% annual raise. You are easily forgotten as an individual all in the name of the company's lofty goals. If you are not an exempt salaried employee, then you can basically expect to only take advantage of a fraction of the real benefits. Finally, unless you are an extremely unique minority outlier you will have an extraordinarily difficult time gaining opportunities for advancement.

- Week off at Thanksgiving and at Christmas
- Decent pay and benefits
","- Apple Park looks and feels like a busy airport. The desks are tiny and the noise level is excessive. There is zero privacy. Also no vending machines! And no food at your desk because they want the rats to stay outside (seriously, it's a ""park"").
- Intense pressure and stress from Nov-Apr. Otherwise, sightly less pressure and stress.
- Secretive management. Non-transparent decision making. 
- You're a very small cog in a big machine
- Your experience at Apple depends on who your boss is. Land the wrong boss and you're in a deep dark hole
- And no, despite the glossy advertising, you can't transfer to a different group. I have only known two people who did it, and one was following his boss.

2021-04-07, IOS App Reviewer,Cork,"Current Employee, more than 5 years",Feeling like a number,"Good perks like healthcare for being in Ireland, the job itself is easy enough
","I feel like a number. Nothing more. All of us have been working from home and instead of valuing that financially, we get a free box of nuts and potato crisps now and then. 
The employee support is useless. I haven’t the slightest clue why there are ways to contact them if nothing ever happens.
Apple claims to be a tolerant and open minded company and - while App Review is absolutely the one place we can say that feels like a fun place to work, I’ve collected many stories from colleagues about previous experiences. 
There is bullying in Apple. There is just no one in Apple to help you when it happens to you. 
One of my ex-colleagues was bullied by her manager who then made sure that when for organisational reasons the entire team went to someone else, she wouldn’t get a new manager. That colleague reported this several times and only after she left the company, they made sure to ask to not look like a bad employer.
I myself have reported abuse and nothing happened. 
I entered Apple with high hopes and job-wise I am good. But on a human level Apple is an enabler for abusive behaviour.
Advice to Management
Change the employee support system. I am just one of many people who you have failed. Many of them have left while their bullies remain. I haven’t left yet, but am looking. I wouldn’t recommend working with Apple to anyone. And I’ve even switched away from Apple products personally because it all feels like a lie by now.

2021-04-07, Genius Administrator,"Southampton, England, England","Former Employee, more than 3 years",Genius Admin,"Relatively good stock options (RSU, given annually).
Free food on shift from time to time and other small perks.
Very talented and amicable team of colleagues. Managerial staff very understanding, reasonable and helpful.
Most important: Looks good on a CV.
","All of these are core issues which are company-specific and do not in any way relate to the genuinely fantastic team of people who work in the retail stores.
Incredible amounts of stress/ being overworked. Throughout my time there, less and less freedom and trust was afforded to us in the way that we worked, often forcing us to not be able to present adequate solutions to customers, and indeed often forcing us to say things to the customer that we didn't agree with and which were totally unreasonable.
Gym and dental reimbursements simply not accepted despite constant emails to HR (I tried for 6 months to get these through HR and I left the company and never received these. £650 out of pocket).
Most of the workforce is talented and capable of getting a higher paid job elsewhere rather than being stuck in retail and being overworked, but Apple ties you into its ecosystem. Whilst the RSUs are very much welcome, these vest over three years and are therefore another way in which many amongst the workforce are essentially trapped.
Most of the workforce who want to progress internally are put in makeshift 'career experience' roles which second them to another position and give them the sense of progression without the physical achievement, doing a higher-paid job for no change in salary. In the event that the opportunity to progress is achieved, it often means relocating elsewhere in the country to another store.
Brainwashing of staff to follow a 'credo' (I didn't subscribe to the 'brainwashing' narrative initially, however it took some time to snap out of it before realising that Apple does much to suck you, as an employee, into its ecosystem and to get you to subscribe to its agenda). In relation, on occasion some very political issues were forced onto staff from higher up via internal channels, in so much as that not having a certain opinion on a certain topic is unacceptable.
Advice to Management
Decrease the workload on individual employees; despite being at the recommended amount of people (which management kept repeating to us), more people certainly needed to be hired (this is genius-bar specific, perhaps not necessarily on red zone/ product zone staff). Otherwise, whilst managerial behaviour is most often impeccable and reasonable, in general please be more pragmatic and human with the staff regarding the credo etc. Reiterating this is simply patronising and only inspires the small minority of employees whose freedom of thought has already been hijacked by the way that the suits in Cupertino want employees to think.

Could be good for junior engineers to gain experience before moving to a more interesting job.
","Micromanagement on all levels drove me to a quick bunout and eroded my self esteem. My most productive time was when the boss was on holiday.
Too much time spent on planning and reporting compared to time used for work.
Corporate brainwash.
HR completely useless.
Often isssues are passed from one to another rather than working together to solve them - this is common in large organisations.
Very tight schedules leave no room for much inovation and personal growth.
Spageti legacy code passed from project to project with little time to clean it up.
Teams spread across different timezones around the world might result in many meetings at odd times.

2021-03-31, Logistics Specialist,"Mesa, AZ",Current Employee,Smoke and mirrors,"Great benefits, stock options, great employee discounts on products. That’s about where it ends.
","Pay is less compared to smaller companies doing twice as much volume. They say “ their benefits off set the pay”, raises are trash even pre COVID. You got MAX 2.5% did not matter if you were a top performer or don’t know your head from your butt. They would then give you RSU that take up to 4 years to vest. You get new RSU every review cycle. So that awesome number you see in your account you will only have a factor of it and when you leave all RSU that have not vested are given back to Apple. Everything is a go go go, they always have staffing issues and never bring in people that ever see this world and expect production is going to double since they doubled staffing. Most of the new contractor were more skilled after 90 days than FTE that have been there for 3+ years. The managers have zero technical knowledge. They spend zero time with their employees. I talked to my manager once a month if that. They won’t only come find you if you did something wrong. They would never praise on great work and always try to ruin you for something that happened 18 months ago. It was always re brought up constantly and they never got over it. If you were not in the inner circle you were over worked and held to unrealistic expectations. The “Apple culture” that everyone thinks there is all from retail. The corporate side has zero team work and nepotism running wild through its ranks. 

Stay in retail and grow on that side do not come to the IS&T side. You will get burnt out and learn to resent managers.
Advice to Management
Need to get rid of the same clowns that drove yahoo into the ground in the early 2000s is now driving decisions in the same area they ruined before. One got hired then slowly started hiring all of cronies. Don’t ask for input for breakfix then tell us it does not matter. It is my choice then stop asking us for feedback and just be the dictator you are striving to be. Just killing moral because you are a boss not a leader. You are destroying great talent.

Some of the best people I've ever worked with. Almost everyone assumes positive intent and provide feedback in a constructive way.
","Not a lot of career potential in the retail store. Even if you're mac and iOS technician, don't expect to be offered anything other than retail jobs at Apple. Though they are trying to change things, the divide between retail and corporate is huge. 

Also, don't expect much flexibility in your work. The schedulers will say they'll work with you, but in reality it's not that easy to get shifts swapped and they require full availability if you're full-time.

Advice to Management
Don't neglect the top performers in the company. Develop and promote them as leaders so they decide to stay. Offer more opportunities to work on projects that may be unrelated to the day to day work but still valuable to the company. This will keep folks engaged and interested in where the future of the company is headed.

A high team morale is important for success day in and day out. I believe that it is one of the store leader’s top responsibilities to gauge this and actively participate to help boost it if it sinks. When I left Apple, the quarterly internal survey essentially reported the lowest rating for team morale since that store’s opening. Pay close attention, talk to your people, be present in ALL areas of your store.

","With the rise of entitlement these days, it’s hard to delight customers sometimes no matter what you do or say. If you get a bad survey, it counts against your metrics and your ability to get a decent schedule. Their metrics and schedule system are messed up and unfair.

Advice to Management
Since I've left the senior manager who caused me a lot of issues and upser was transferred to another store. My line manager was transferred during my time there due to their neglect and bullying. Both of these managers were female and both demonised me for having mental health issues. Was also lied to about career prospects by the senior manager during the hiring process.

 I dealt with a lot of sexism, was told I only had the job due to my looks and the size of my chest. Also within my first few weeks of starting I had a cleaner purposely follow me into the toilets, who was later sacked.

On the surface this place may appear amazing but from my experience it is rotten underneath.

Very smart, capable experts in their fields 
","antly striving for perfection
Good pay and benefits
Cons
Decisions are made in Cupertino by the exec team, and the rest of the org works internally to influence decisions upward and then executes against those plans after approved. It can become frustrating if you are used to making decisions.
Career mobility is extremely limited (no horizontal, some promotions but in title only). Most people stay in the same job for 8-10 years. It can harm you when you leave the company to go somewhere else. Your perspective is very narrow.
Spend most of your time on internal communications and influencing.
Advice to Management

Or I would simply forget because the store is so busy so I would rush to be on the floor. Also, when I was a seasonal employee and I was told only 2 would be kept yet you keep 4 instead- that made me feel lied to and deceived. It’s important to make sure you’re being honest and acting on good integrity. I also spread myself thin to make myself as available as possible to you when I had another job and 4 classes. I felt that was not taken into consideration when choosing who was to be kept. The stress on selling AppleCare is also very tough- I tried my best and had great customer reviews

There are both full time and part time benefits. Discounts are awesome with Apple, and there are many other discounts you get from other companies. They will work with your college schedule annndd there is tuition reimbursement!
","Management will talk a big game to follow the principles of the company, then in the same breath tell you to do something completely else to align with their own goals. It is very very very rare that they will open a full time position. If you’re hired on as a specialist, you will not be offered a full time position until you are promoted to a Pro or Genius level position.
Advice to Management
Live the credo and if you are telling us to do something be transparent and tell us why. Open full time positions, if you keep everyone at part time with no carrot to move forward you will continue to have a high turn over rate with employees.

","Poor retail hours. No one cares about your life outside of the stainless steel box. Sell sell sell....fix fix fix. Delegating tasks and taking credit for successes only while failures are others faults.

2021-02-25, Technical Specialist,"South Windsor, CT","Current Employee, more than 1 year",Apple's greateast facade,"A refreshingly collaborative environment that lends itself to personal growth and development. There is a stringent hiring process, but it ultimately results in the organization sourcing candidates that are like-minded, empathetic, and forming connections is generally pretty easy.
","Growth opportunities are limited and ultimately a byproduct of favoritism rather than any real sense of objectivity and what is sensible for the team. Within the last month, the interview process has been moderately altered and offers more of a sense of objectivity, but is ultimately farcical. Initiatives at the retail level ultimately revolve around meeting the demand of unreliable performance metrics and wildly varying company directives. The organization also lays claim to compassion and direct action toward protecting human rights without recognition to its own transgressions against humanity, utilizing slave / internment labor to fulfill manufacturing in China, compliance with initiatives which stand directly against any modicum of humanity. Between the stockpile of cash reserves, the year over year growth in valuation and earnings, one would think that they would pay their employees more fairly, but that's also tossed to the wayside. There is not any shred of real accountability or integrity within the confines of this place, and anyone who states otherwise is participating in and complicit with the facade.
Advice to Management
The majority of the management I've encountered offer very little in regard to genuine growth or development, have an underwhelming amount of technical knowledge, and often are not fit to be in positions of leadership. There's also a robotic nature to all of them where they've mastered the art of appearing to care, but ultimately offer nothing of real support or benefit in extenuating circumstances or accommodating genuine need.

Discounted products are great
Recession proof, when Covid hit I was sent a computer so I could work from home
","Each Apple Store is run a bit differently, if your Apple Store managers are self-serving then there will be bias and it will prevent you from getting promoted. 
Arbitrary rules without guidance are created constantly.
Emotionally and mentally taxing days due to people unloading stress on you all the time. 
Just because you are a good worker and have been there a while does not mean you can get promoted
Work can be consuming if you don't establish boundaries
Advice to Management
Minding your business about what happens outside of work can help you not be so biased about who gets promotions and who does not. Apple is a great company so the only thing that really makes or breaks your experience is a good manager.

2021-02-24, Tech Support Advisor Cork,Cork,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",Welcome to...,"We had now and then some free snacks at work for which you needed to stay in line during your breaks ( 15 minutes ). For the job that you do there, everyone deserves double the salary. You are basically a machine that is connected to the computer to answer questions and be polite with customers. I won an Iphone and Beats headphones.
","So, I am someone who started hating apple from the bottom of my heart. I needed 45 minutes after work just to clear my head and be able to speak with people again. As I mentioned you are connected to the computer and you need to be so scripted, every week the phone calls are being listened to and you are being marked for all kind of things. If you score low you lose the possibility to choose your shift. The job is so micromanaged that I get sick of thinking about it. 

In 6 months they changed 4 managers of our team. There are so many things.. I was working as IOS and Mac + Advisor for the German team. 
If you are a soft and nice person stay away!!! 

The pay is terrible.

-Most customers that enter an Apple Store either know they are there to make a large purpose or are there for technical troubleshooting, the clarity around those two reasons for being in the store is helpful.

","Greater emphasis on metrics than what you’re told in training. Diversity problems. While Apple is LGBTQ “friendly,” and has taken steps to make sure that is has many women employed, it is dismally the opposite for Blacks and Hispanics. Speaking up, as a black person can single you out as difficult, without having even said anything remotely antagonistic. Within retail favoritism and politics abound. It’s harder to get ahead than what you’re told as a new hire. Personal development has taken a backseat over the last 6 years to driving the sales metrics of the stores. Since your supervisors are also trying to move up the ladder they will forget about your development in the process of moving up and on. Pre pandemic, the Apple stores in my city were places that anyone could come in and that made for sometimes violent or criminal behavior that could affect your work day. Even vendors that Apple uses, like Post Mates have been regularly abusive to Apple employees.

","To get promoted you have to do more than just have excellent numbers. You have to come up with all sorts of useless extra charts, mass emails to the team on best practices, memos, side projects etc that make it *look* like you're going above and beyond or ""innovating"" as they call it. Really no one reads any of it and it's completely useless for anything other than your ability to make an argument for promotion when the time comes. The company says this is to drive innovation from the bottom, but really that only comes from management and they disregard any feedback on meaningful changes. It feels like all management does is discuss how to generate ""buy-in"" as they call it from the team on what ever the companies flavor of the month is in terms of what ever metric they'd like to track. The company repeats over and over that ""It's not about the metics or numbers"" and ""it's about enriching lives"" when in reality it is very much all about the numbers, but they frame it in this very Orwellian way where instead of saying ""your numbers for applecard financing are low"" they'll say something like ""We know that talking about Apple Card and teaching customers about its benefits gives customers another incredible option to bring home this amazing technology today that will enrich their life"". If you don't catch the hint that what they're saying is your numbers are low than you'll never get promoted, and you'll never get higher than average on a yearly review.

Then the biggest con- a different schedule every single day. You'll never have two days off together again.
Advice to Management
Instead of just generating a bunch of useless internal memos to ""innovate"" try actually looking at what numbers need work- then tell the employees the truth about it. Have them reverse shadow someone who excels in that, and then bring the whole team up together instead of being so obsessed with how to word things in the perfect way that inevitably leaves goals ambiguous at best, or dishonest at worst.

2021-02-12, Localization QA Tester,Cork,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Center of Corruption, Racism, Sexism and Nepotism","Salary is good and nothing else is good and that ""nothing else"" is not something bearable that you can say ""okay I will try my best and I will save some money and I will leave"". No sir, the cake's not worth the candle, really.
","If you are not from some ""certain"" countries, you are on your own and nobody will care about you, nobody will help you when you need. And when it is time to give permanent Apple positions to the contractors, it is the worst part: if you are not boyfriend/girlfriend of ""somebody who knows somebody"" then you stand almost zero chance: they will give these permanent Apple positions as if they grant their own property to the people which they like. Nothing is about being qualified or how you do your job. For example, when I first applied for a permanent Apple position they said I didn't have enough experience which was 6 months, but they hired many many people with less than 2 months experience with nothing on their CV. Yes I asked them about it, how these guys had more experience than I did, they had no answer. Also some superior managers never introduce you to HQ in Cupertino. It is like a Sindrella story they want to hide you from the superior managements because maybe they might hire you and in that case these corrupted managers cannot give the position to their favored friends/partners. In my example, all the people who were given the permanent position were interviewed by my organization first and then by US organization. However I was interviewed first by managers of my team and the second interview was by the managers of my team once again. They didn't follow the usual interviewing procedures because they already decided about me months before the interview and if you pass their first interview, they organize a second one with irrelevant questions. Here, you might think that ""okay dude obviously they were not happy with your service, the way you work"" etc... No. A big NO as I have personally requested feedbacks all the time just to see if there was something negative so I'd be able to improve myself. I haven't had any negative feedback from any manager. On the contrary all the other leads and supervisors were telling me I was doing a great job and they used to thank me in person thanks to the way I do cooperate with them. Some of my supervisors were also surprised and upset when they heard the news that Apple didn't give me the permanent position and also they didn't extend my contract. Without any negative feedback, any explanation, any complaint... 
I was suspecting this kind of corruptions and I informed superior managers: ""big guys"", including my manager up to the highest level of the management I also tried to get help from ""Business Conduct"" and they also ignored this corruption. (Business conduct is supposed to deal with any kind of misconduct so here nepotism, racism and sexism are all ""core values"" of Apple, otherwise ""Business Conduct"" would take some action, no?) And these days I know they need to fill the position I left, I hear they interview some other people to hire as contractor/summer cover and guess what: most of the candidates are friends of the same ""somebody"". 
Ah I forgot the best part: 
when they didn't extend my contract, my team had a summer cover which barely had 10% of my experience and skills, they gave the position to her (because somebody in my team didn't like our team is ""all male"" so they wanted a ""female"") and they hired a friend of theirs who would also ignore their incompetent practices. So I have worked in/ for many international companies but Apple was the worst, a total career terrorism. They commit all the unprofessional and corrupted actions and they get away with it. I first thought it was just some corrupted people at Apple and the company would not tolerate any of it as they claim it with fancy words on twitter but I can say they just claim they are against racism, sexism, nepotism etc on social media but they promote all of these.
If you think Apple would be a career leap, remember about this message. If you are just a random person and cannot be favored by somebody in the management stay away. If you already have your own routine, if you are happy what you have now, do not take any risks with Apple because you might lose even what you have now.
In conclusion: There are many other details I forgot and I cannot put in here but I can say I thought I was the only one to be exposed all these misconducts but when I put the stick into the hornets' nest, I have seen there are way too many people suffered of the same thing. They are all from the different departments of the company in different countries. 
PS. I haven't mentioned how these new but favored people are awarded with test lead positions or some other managing roles while the other people who has been in the company since years (like 10+ years) were not promoted. It is not that only 1-2 bad apples corrupting the whole basket, no. All levels of the management are aware of the situation and they want to benefit from it. This is what they want.
Advice to Management
Do something about racism, sexism, nepotism in the company and run some mental checks on a regular basis especially on the managers. IT jobs require a sane mind and dealing with IT related stuff might have some bad effects on our mental health which is not the end of the world but please provide these ill-minded people with the required treatment otherwise they become dengerous lunatics destroying people's lives and careers.

Advice to Management
Reach out to your staff and actually listen to them when they're asking for help instead of talking about yourself and all your own personal problems, not relevant and just adds to the stress. No option for part time, constant roster changes it is not flexible for working families.

They lied a lot (omit tons of stuff willingly to be precise) about everything and they tried to covered up several not very clear things happening inside .
Someone went to go to local news in order to be heard (related to being forced into working in office when clearly able to wfh as we previously did) you can find an article somewhere in Ireland news.
Insane targets (pushing during pandemic with crazy targets and during prolonged lockdowns when people clearly cannot vent themselves)

Pros
Salary was good due to tenure; loads of holiday; some good free stuff and discount; loads of great energy and people; fun; early management was great, meet many interesting people and some famous ones.
Cons
Management - regular changes and career climbers only interested in box ticking, lack of progression opportunities, corporate b$ sugar coated in psychobabble, management misbehaviour and favouritism, cliquey. Pretend flat heirachy and feedback mechanism. Inconsistent application of company Credo, no regular shift pattern given no more than 3 weeks notice, difficult to have family life with this job.

2021-02-07, College AppleCare Advisor,"Dallas, TX","Current Employee, more than 3 years",Great pay + benefits but highly micromanaged,"$15/hr starting. 20 hours a week for the college program. Full time Benefits. Stock plan. Pick your own schedule each semester. 4 hr shifts. One 8 hour shift on the weekend tho. Incremental raises once a year.

Diversity is great. There are remote video opportunities that you can engage in with groups that you’re apart of. Black at Apple. Amigos at Apple. Women at Apple. These subgroups really make my shifts a breeze because people are so warm and relatable.
","Managers heavily micromanage you. They can see in a program the moment you open the software to take calls, how much time you’re idle, how long you take between calls, etc. And they will ask you why you’re taking so much time if your numbers are higher than they should be. They’re also strict on attendance.

Pros
Working for Apple always enabled me to feel that I'm helping other people and taking some part of the significant changes for a better world. At Apple, all the colleagues were highly motivated and passionate about driving the business forward because they believed what Apple was doing was contributing to the society: being a part of that team was a great experience to me. They also offered competitive salary.
Cons
Sometimes overworked because there were so many customers who wanted to purchase products. It's rare that you can finish working on time. Basically 10-15 minutes overworked.

The campus in Hollyhill, Cork is pretty cool, and the food is also nice
","If you're hired as a Technical advisor, you're gonna have it really hard to leave AppleCare. During the interview process, I was told that after a year I could apply to a job outside AppleCare (I wanted to work in the marketing department or video production), but after 8 months, I had a meeting with my current manager and he told me that if I was hired to work in AppleCare I had to stay in AppleCare. He clearly was cutting down all my chances to change department, since to apply for another job I first need my manager approval. 
I was extremely disappointed so I decided to quit.
The work hours are extremely long. You technically have a 15 minutes break every 2h, but sometimes a call takes more than 2h and then you can't take the break. 
Also, if your launch break is after 2.30pm, and you didn't bring food with you, you won't eat anything because the dinning hall on campus is closed, which I find unacceptable since they know people have launch breaks after 3pm or even 5pm. 
You need to go to get your food during an early break (if you're not in the middle of a call) and get your food, but by the time you are on your launch break, the food is completely cold.

","- Although I understand there needs to be a way to evaluate employee performance, I'm not sure if customer reviews are the best gauge especially if you work in the technical side where many customers tend to come in with anger and disappointment and will not hesitate to give a rather biased feedback as long as they don't get exactly what they want even though it is not in the hands of the employees most of the time.

Give promotions to people that preform well and actually know how to work with people. Brown nosing shouldn't be the way to do things. I saw multiple people get promotes over others where their scores were WAY below average but because they were ""friends"" with a higher up, they got the job.

Advice to Management
Rather than focusing on the numbers and setting a hard target to achieve them with, try to understand employee's point of views and to focus more on the customer experience. Sales and numbers will follow when an employee is happy working and providing a great experience for a customer. Sometimes it feels like we are trying to upsell or push a product and service just so we can hit our minimum requirements for the week, rather than focusing on the experience which is detrimental to the customer journey as well as employee happiness. The focus on human connection feels like its no longer there, compared to a few years back.

Advice to Management
Take notice of the people who are really trying their best and working hard. Take notice of which employees are truly liked and which aren’t. Employees who are liked by their peers and work hard get overlooked a lot because leadership is often distracted by employees who appear to have a very ‘high’ performance by numbers, and very, very poor relationships with their peers and with their customers.

2021-01-27, Apple At Home Advisor,"Chandler, AZ","Current Employee, more than 3 years",Group think to advance,"- OK pay
- great name on a resume
- nice people
- easier to get into as temp winter employee
- stock is great, especially since they keep it affordable for entry level employees
- ok health unless your full time
","- you must be a super energetic cheer leader for Apple to advance
- above requirement makes group think a big issue; hard to find original ideas
- sensitive; every day I work in fear because I never know what new extreme left policy they utilize will trigger false accusations 
- the need to appease identitarian extremists is so great I am regularly and falsely accused of discrimination
- huge lack of diversity. Everyone looks different, but thinks the same. It is kind of like the stepford wives. Lots of smiles and niceness, just don’t mention anything politically moderate or right leaning.
- because of all of the above, it isn’t uncommon to see employees emotionally and verbally abuse other employees for taking a stand for something that doesn’t align with identitarian intersectional ideology.
Advice to Management
Create a DNA for conservatives. Apple says they are “for everybody” in their values but fail miserably for people who are more conservative leaning. There have been so many people I’ve known who would say, “I am just using this place” or “this place will never accept me.” Lots of talent is lost in this manner, and having people who have been successful yet conservative at Apple guide you through understanding and navigating the terrain will help keep some talent. Though, because of the above cons, I seriously doubt Apple could find any leaders who are either conservative or will admit to being so.

and to be honest I must say:
the company is very diverse and rich of culture
","I worked there for few months as a C-Spec through a third party subcontractor (Apex) and here are the cons of my experience there: 

• No appreciation at all. (not talking about money here. talking about ""thank you"")
• Bad work environment. (too much tension)
• They did not provide a prayer room form me (as I am Muslim) 
• no teamwork - you are not appreciated if you tried to help a member of your team.
• No compensations
• No job growth

I left the job because I did not find myself there and I will never ever EVER work for either ""Apple"" or even ""Apex""

- Bit of comical banter amongst the team
","- A very competitive environment. 
- Favouritism towards the wrong people. There is a strong culture of promoting those whom talk the most and peacock around the shop. 
- Ostracism from the managers. 
- Constant culture brainwashing.
- No say in the roster you receive each week. Often horrible shifts that create no work life balance. 
- Download meetings every day targeted for team members who want to show off their public speaking skills, which you have to sit through. 
- You soon realise its just temp job after you experience the day-to-day culture environment.

Advice to Management
You could have 100 good calls in a row and as soon as you get one bad call, management is all over you. They give zero support to employees and automatically assume you did something wrong, even when people are goign to rate you bad no matter what. Management has a mentality that they ""know better"" so they think anytime you have a bad call, that if they were on the line it would have been a 'good' call, which is often not the case.

Advice to Management
Don’t nickel and dime your employees. You end up pushing them away instead of providing what they need. I had intended in building my entire career at Apple but had to reassess my career plan when I was asked to essentially spend my entire promotion raise on travel expenses and additional travel time.

Compensation is generous for invested employees, and the products themselves are interesting to build.
","Most engineers are professional and helpful, but there is no training culture or push for code methodology apart from general product-related guidelines - these subjects are left to the manager's discretion. So there is too much room for improvement in work efficiency, causing actual work to slow to a crawl. It's like the Israel section is still recovering from its chaotic time as a bunch of startups stiched together.

2021-01-12, Specialist,"Deer Park, IL","Former Employee, more than 1 year",Good Resume Builder,"Benefits, sales experience, tech experience, discounts, small sample of leading corporate culture, great staff to work with. My immediate reporting manager was amazing as was my store manager/HR. Most of the time sales were easy.
","INADEQUATE TRAINING. I was someone who started without an abundance of tech knowledge. My team taught me something new every day, all day. Normally a good thing but not great when the store is swamped (which frequently happens) and you're essentially on your own. Still retail, Same challenges with any other retail position: Unrealistic hours (cant exactly be helped. Weekends and nights), Not enough Pay to scrape by (On the higher side of retail though.) ""Unspoken"" sales/business intro/apple accessory + service quotas. Zero incentive to achieve a top position in any previously mentioned categories, aside from recognition. Any advancement WILL require some outside education. Apple/ Store sponsorship does exist to some varying degree. Apple corporate and Apple retail are two ENTIRELY different entities. Just because an employee enters the Apple ""eco-system"" at a base level doesn't mean that the employee may have a better chance of securing a corporate career, even with an adequate curriculum vitae and professional experience. Experiences seem like more of a way to ""tease"" employees rather than show a glimpse of a future career.
Advice to Management
Hit or miss. Mainly issues at corporate levels rather than direct store issues. Management styles shouldn't vary wildly manager to manager. Please keep employees up to speed and help them use outside sources to train. ""Hello"" and training modules exist but these tools are useless without ample time to actually study the material. Get some hands on physical basics (computer internals), new phones to practice basic iOS diagnostics/resets. SET ADEQUATE time aside for new hires to learn, I cannot stress this enough. The last thing you need is a new hire sheep waiting for help with a quick fix while management is dealing with unruly customers. It will only benefit in the long run. Some favoritism took place. We all know resources are limited and management at a store level won't change the entire company, but some more measures need to be implemented. For everyones sanity.

","No managers or support even when customers are screaming at you. Many of my co workers are having mental health issues because of how this job is designed and Apple does not want to hear about it. It is so stressful. I've never worked in a place that I could not get support from a manager. It does not exist in this role. Imagine someone has purchased a $3000 laptop and it never arrived in the mail and they have been given the wrong info when they called before (and the time before that). Yep sorry no you can't speak to a manager because there aren't any and I'm working at home. It's just you and me on the phone and you're yelling at me and there's nothing I can do. For the first few weeks I felt like this was the second worst job I have ever had but now that I've done it for a few months, it's moved into the number one spot. I have nightmares and can’t sleep most nights. I dread sitting at my desk and taking a call because you never know what you’re going to get on the other end of the line. And the whole set up is right in the middle of my home so even when I’m not working, it sits there and I have to look at it. I can’t get away.
Advice to Management
Design this system differently so specialists can get a manager on the line to speak with customers who demand it. The world is different now and Apple needs to adapt.

It is always difficult to deliver unwanted news or explain what is hard to explain. Retail hours are retail hours.

2020-12-21, Specialist,"Orange, CA","Former Employee, more than 5 years",Equal Parts Challenge and Reward - Not for everyone,"The benefit package is excellent, even for part-time employees. 401k, stock options, medical/vision/dental, a wide range of product discounts, and other benefits. You get to work with a lot of high-functioning, like minded people, which means you'll make a lot of friends. The pay is competitive for a retail job.
","The job is as challenging as it is rewarding - and as of late the challenges outweighed the rewards. Pay is not negotiable and superior sales performance is given little to no consideration during your 'merit increases' which are 3.5-5% per year, once a year. 

The high customer traffic, high noise, bright lights, and being on your feet for 8-9 hours can be physically taxing. Full-time work during holiday and launch season can be draining. The customers in my area were typically high-maintenance types and were often difficult to deal with.

Advancing in the company is more about playing the political game than how well your actual job is being done, which frequently results in people being advanced to management and leadership positions who do not have the right hard skills or competencies for the task. A good leadership team can really shape your experience at Apple as much as the work you put into it.

2020-12-14, Analyst,"Austin, TX","Current Employee, more than 8 years",So-So,"- New ideas are encouraged
- Coworkers and peers are incredibly smart
","- The Apple culture is changing for worse. What was once a prestigious tech company who had a passion for innovation and people has disappeared and turned into a powerhouse of labor exploitation. Expect long hours and little pay
- On average, Apple provides around 3% pay raises each year. This does not cover the increasing costs of living in Austin. It doesn’t matter how great of an employee you are, you should expect 3%. There is no reason to work hard.
- Apple does not care about the city of Austin or the citizens that live here. Apple takes tax breaks and incentives, while continuing to white-wash any culture out of Austin, contribute to awful traffic patterns, and keeping overall city wages stagnant.
- Utilizing time off benefits is frowned upon. Workload sits for you to complete when you return, negating any kind of ""refreshment"" you feel from being away
- No room for promotions. Management does not care about development or helping you explore other opportunities. 
- Management is constantly talking about how much money our department has saved the company (we’re talking millions of dollars), meanwhile a peer on my team is on food stamps.
- Many of my peers are struggling with mental health issues due to being overworked and not having enough time off. Apple’s health benefits barely cover any type of treatment for mental health issues. Even the “top tier” health insurance plan does not cover widely accepted mental health treatment and instead insurance encourages you to take Xanax.
- When we had on-site doctors, they were low quality and constantly gaslight you

Employees join companies but leave managers.

In spite of how good a job may be, people will quit if the reporting relationship is not healthy. ""People leave managers not companies...in the end, turnover is mostly a manager issue.""

","There is really a lack of communication between management and corporate. They don't typically visit unless its for press or launch and if there are issues they are slow to fix it. For years out HVAC has had issues and this summer, during a pandemic, record-breaking heat wave, and fires our ac wasn't working. Some days it would get up to 85-90 degrees inside our store and it sucked. it took weeks to get fixed and we still have problems. Occasionally it'll smell like smoke inside because a belt is broken, and now with winter coming the heating doesn't work that well.

","Hypocrisy is the main philosophy of this company. They tell people to not worry and do what they can but they fire a third of the new people before finishing their probation because they are not good enough or they don't bend on their knees enough.
You are even controlled when you pee, how much you pee and they even ask you if you pee day more than the usual one day. You have 7 minutes per day to go to the bathroom and don't you even dare to go if it is a busy day.
The micromanagement in this company is brutal, doesn't matter how much you do, you will be always asked for more, they are always in your back with a whip.
They will try to wash your brain, they will harass you, and prepare yourself to be the manager's ´´favorite´´ if you want to get a higher position. And don't even dare to go to apply to a higher position if you don't want to be depressed as are half of the senior advisors.

Advice to Management
During training you tell us that “we want to help you grow” but when the time comes they never do. Depending on what store your working in or the manager, some do really want to help the employee succeed. But in my store anytime you talk with a manager about wanting to grow, in-company career opportunities their not there to help. During Covid, I understand it’s hard times and they want to keep us safe, but I was hired as a sales specialist and made me work as an AHA advisor troubleshooting etc. I was never trained as a technician! I was trained as a sales representative. Felt like I was drafted in the military when they started making us work from home. I wouldn’t have a problem working from home if it was RCC (at home retail advisor). As an AHA it was too stressful and less pay for it too.

","As with any consumer-based job, there is more care placed in the treatment of customers than employees, though I've heard that varies depending on your location. It's a retail job so you have little say in what days and times you'd want to work and customers can be...not great. Discounts aren't as high as you'd think. Because of the schedule and dealing with customers and back-to-back appointments, I was pretty tired of the work after about a year. But that could just be due to the fact that I wasn't doing what I love

They put you through rigorous training until you're ready as well. Unfortunately I left Apple due to COVID.
","Competitive to climb up as essentially everyone wants to, limited openings to moving up. Also hours were kind of odd if you work retail, most of my workdays, including my cohorts, were right between 11 am - 9 pm.

2020-11-21, Siri Grading Analyst,Hyderābād,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",Excellent pay and perks but not great culture,"For any position you get awesome salary. Additionally, you get discounts on Apple products upto 17 % for friends and family on every product but you are limited to 10 products of each category(10phones, 10 airpods, 10 macbooks etc). And for your personal use you get 27% but limited to one product of each category. 
You also get 500USD credit additionally for every 2 years. 

You get 15 % discount on stocks but you can just buy them you can only opt to buy shares from your salary and the company will automatically deduct the amount from the salary. It is similar to VPF where you choose the percentage of deduction. Here you can only choose from 0 to 10% of your salary to be invested in shares. You cannot additionally buy elsewhere for 15% discount. 
You can also avail 155000 INR for any educational courses that you need to do. 
During the pandemic they also reimbursed for furniture.
","The work culture is good not that interactive. All of the decision making is in Cupertino(HQ) and if you want to contribute to the process then it is not possible. You don't even have someone in the leadership to collaborate with. They give the work and you have to do it, contrary to Amazon where if you propose something and the leadership finds it impactful then they give you the ownership and also collaborate with you on that idea/project. If you want to just work and leave then its great for you but if you want to do something more apart from usual work then the aforementioned applies.

The educational courses mentioned need to be relevant to your work that you are doing at Apple and if your work and the educational course are not in the same field you won't get reimbursed. 
Furniture reimbursement is limited to 100 USD(7000INR) which is quite less. You either get a good table or an ergonomic chair but not both. 

There are not much ad-hoc tasks apart from the daily work which is pretty monotonous and tiring.

For this particular role(grading analyst) they give you iMac and not Macbooks to work so WorkFromHome is not allowed under ideal conditions. Due to the pandemic the iMacs were transported to everyone's homes and WFH was established for the team. 
There is no transport provided by the company but that's manageable since they are paying a lot.

","Apple Australia is SUCH a different company & culture than Apple in the US. Sales and service metrics are king, everything else falls by the wayside.
Don’t call in sick or take a personal day for work-life balance, you’ll be ostracized by leadership. 
Bullying is RAMPANT in Australian retail stores, when brought to leadership’s attention - they tell you that it must be you because you’re not assuming positive intent. 
Favoritism is everywhere and not hidden - be one of the cool kids or you’ll be left out of every opportunity.
Advice to Management
Bring back Steve’s vision, a fierce customer focus, and treat team members like part of the team. Get rid of the rampant bullying and favoritism and learn that harassment (however subtle) is never okay and should never be swept under the rug by HR after complaints.

","Company claims to better about things like diversity and inclusion, respecting employees time and work life balance, etc. but their actions speak louder than their words. Non-receptive to feedback. Working for them felt like being gaslight- they would promise to change, say they care and even go so far as to make us hug and say they ""loved"" us, which was weird and cultish. I observed and experienced being tokenized as a minority. There were many complaints of pay inequity, as well as HR complaints that ended in HR telling the parties to ""talk it out"" internally when it felt clear to me (and others) that they should have been punishable offenses. Leadership would routinely act similar to politicians, making promises they didn't keep. Many people, likely trying to get promoted, had a facade of niceness which became exhuasting to be around.

*Great Pay
*Work from Home
*Access to developmental materials
*Paid vacation/sick
*Chance for rotations
*Internal Job posting website and staff directories/chats
","*Still a phone support job
*Customers can be extremely rude
*Everything is very metric driven, when you are working you are on calls non stop. No time to stop between calls for anything its just go go go all the time.
*Weekend shifts and night time shifts can be rough and last the entire semester.
Advice to Management
I actually really like this company and they have recently begun to give their college staff a lot more access to developmental opportunities. If I get an offer for one of the many positions I've applied for within the company that are related to my major I would stay forever.

The campus is pretty
The recruiter will butter you up
","The kool aid goes down real easy at first.
Siloed, rigid working groups and projects.
Overspecialization that breads complacency so people get “stuck” there with titles that do not represent what is left of their skill set. 
Unguaranteed discretionary bonuses used to “motivate” team members encouraging a gross culture with untracked favors. The culture might be better in other parts of the org. 
Unclear leadership values leave groups out of sync with hearsay and name dropping left running things.
Territorial and at times very unqualified design management.
Poor internal talent management.
Advice to Management
Better fix design leadership and culture because that’s a pretty core part of the company... or at least it was.

- Directors and leaders often make decisions without consulting their teams, and then expect the team to execute on their commitments
- Discourse is usually based on making other people happy instead of making the best engineering decision

- Leadership often has no concept of how to test products well or what kind of talent to hire to make that possible
- Most people only want to do the minimum amount of work to make their manager happy

Advice to Management
The biggest change that would improve Apple's performance would be to make a much larger effort to let engineers work collaboratively instead of skate around their security guidelines. Apple should stop being so obsessed with having secret launches that don't even matter because most of their features have already been implemented by competitors. I have literally spent 8 work months of this year on product security, and it's not even my job.

","0 chance of advancement over 5-year waiting list to become a manager, they get you to backfill just to use you for management but not pay you more.

Advice to Management
actually care about your employees, take calls so that you have some idea how hard it is, management is soooo out of touch with what advisors have to deal with its insane, they don't even know how to help you.

The training and attention you receive is world-class, so is the exposure to the leadership teams.
","Retail is retail, don't see this as an ""in"" towards corporate. The Apple corporate office could simply be considered as a different company. If you're in retail, you'll most likely remain in retail (and on a retail salary).
Advice to Management
Communicate more openly about career progression, otherwise, it's a great program!

2020-10-10, Specialist,,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",Cult-like. Employees no Longer Valued.,"Benefits available for part time employees. Higher starting pay than many retail positions. Employee discount. International company means there are opportunities to keep your job if you relocate. Focus on improving hiring practices for diversity and inclusion. Employees kept on during Covid19 shutdown.
","Toxic positivity at the retail level. Lack of clear and consistent messaging breeds distrust in management and the company at large. Cult-like atmosphere. Gaslighting from management. Management ignoring needs. Difficult to advance. Still hires disproportionate number of white men vs. women and POC. Stores not enforcing social distancing and safety rules during Covid19 reopen, employee safety put below bottom line even though Apple is more than rich enough to take the hit to ensure safety, especially considering retail stores only make up something like 8% of profits.
Advice to Management
At Apple Retail, we are taught to ask questions, listening, and acknowledge customer concerns so that we can have true empathy and align with them. We are constantly told that people are Apple's greatest priority. Employees need this basic respect, not just customers. We can't be treated like robots. If Apple wants retail robots, they can design them. Until then, employees need to be acknowledged and respected as human beings.

","Typical corporate bureaucracy. Advancement is RARELY based on merit and experience. The constant drive for new talent is present in all positions so it is FAR more likely that someone from outside the org will end up your boss than someone whose been promoted. Or it will be someone internal but was transferred from another department. Individual achievements are not recognized. Your success is Apple’s success so know that you are a small cog in a big machine that won’t miss you when you leave. Apple will engulf every aspect of your life. More relatives will call you asking for help with their products than relatives would call you if you won the lottery.

2020-09-29, Hardware Development Engineering Tech,"Cupertino, CA","Former Employee, more than 3 years",Just above average pay for very long hours and being pushed to your limit.,"You get to see the product road map up to 6-8 years out and it can be fun playing with new technology. You get to make awesome designs for great people.

You will learn a lot. Take advantage of their school reimbursement programs and any skill programs offered.

It will be the highest design standards you will work with in your career. Material, tolerances and finishes must be perfect.

Max our your stock options and when vested 401k.

You will learn cutting edge design methods and have excellent standards and practices.

Overtime is good, this can even go to double time in some cases. Having an extra 2-4 hours of overtime a day adds up. Just make sure to pace yourself and take care of your health.

There is always something to do.

If you love the brand it will draw you in and you will have a role in bringing Apple's products to life.

Your work will have an impact on millions of people.

You will do the work of a higher paid position so it will be nice to get that experience.

If you are doing good use this to get a higher position elsewhere, it will help you advance your career faster.
","Management tends to be very self centered, not as much focused on growing your career but in growing their own. This can often cause tension as lots of people are vying for attention of higher ups. Expect to do all manner to tasks to help the team and your manager. Some will be menial but they will lead to more fun and complex projects over time. Make sure you do all your basic work before seeking to get to advanced work. 

There is not a lot of ownership of responsibility in management. Often they will kick downward. For example if they made a call on a design direction and it turns out that the higher ups do not like it they will blame the worker following their request in my experience. Do not count on accountability, however I would recommend if your manager is rude or does something out of line let Apple HR know immediately. It will save you a lot of hassle down the line.

Politics is huge at Apple. Pay very close attention. People will pretend to be your friend or interested in your work to make a connection. If you get too popular with higher ups in a different team management can punish you, even if you were doing your job. Have a pulse on politics. Rank is big at Apple.

Apple's biggest flaw is they rush themselves to the breaking point where for no reason. Often cutting already tight timelines for small reasons rather than give someone an additional 8 hours to refine a design. They can set the deadlines and standards but they often push people far beyond reasonable limits and in some cases the deadlines can be changed just as easily as they are set. In some cases I have worked 28 hours straight on a prototype that could just have easily been move out one day. This creates a scramble culture where you will be under a lot of stress often. You will be blamed for not doing work fast enough when often you can be given timelines that are not physically possible. In those cases be prepared to set expectations so you will not be taken advantage of.

The average day is 12 hours. During a build it typically goes until the project is done. This mind you will get you a 'meets expectations' on your review. Doing above average work is average for Apple standards. You need to go above even that or have a good political connection for the next level.

Often you will have to leave the company/position you are in to get a promotion of any value. Its such a waste that Apple does not help grow people's careers especially after investing so much time into them.

You will often be asked to do the work of others and get no credit for it, even if you do your own expiration be careful as your manager may take your idea. Document everything you do, this will help.

You will often be pushed to commit everything to work and be accessed at all hours of the day. Be careful in how you set boundaries as this can often lead to you not being seen as serious.

You will often do the work at a higher level than your current position but not be paid more for it. You will often help people make extremely complicated projects and get no real recognition for it.
Advice to Management
Recognize ambition and try not to make the career development of others about advancing your own career. Help build others up rather than try and take credit for the work of others.

Listen when people tell you something is wrong or if the person you manage is being bullied. Seriously, listen and help.

When you say you will push back and help with insanely tight deadlines, actually do it. I cannot say how many time we would have a meeting where we would all say the timeline is impossible, our manager would say ""Yep I'll bring that up when we meet,"" then we all met and they would not say a word when the designer laid out their expectations and timeline.

Advice to Management
At home advisors are micro-managed on so many different numbers. Your manager will constantly tell you there is something you can improve on. I've found that you can work for this company for a decade and still be stuck doing the same tasks in the same position. 

There will be peers you meet that moved up quickly and management will tell you it’s your fault if you haven’t transitioned into a higher role. You will have the same manager for about 6 months max, then they will take a leave of absence or go to a new department- so you’re stuck proving yourself to someone new. 

If you are chat support, they will expect you to help up to 3 individuals at once (4 if you are consulting with another department) and respond within 2 minutes while customers are asking “Hello, are you there?” and you are told to lie if the customer asks if we’re helping multiple people.

If you are not fast enough, they will question your ability and recommend you get medical help. Completely absurd.

Repair pricing for all devices is expensive for the average person. This truly is a luxury brand and you will find out soon enough when customers cannot afford the ridiculous prices this company wants to charge everyone for out of warranty repairs.

Bonuses are never received, but there are annual performance reviews typically followed by a 40 cent pay raise and heavily taxed Restricted Stock Units that you cannot touch for years. You will make good money working here, but you will be expected to devote all your time to helping customers in an extremely stressful, fast paced environment while staring at white space on a screen all day.

The major takeaway working for Apple- is that you’re working for a huge corporate conglomerate that overcharges for everything, and furthers capitalism in a way that has made humans codependent on our screens and immediate gratification.

I think your experience being a product specialist will also heavily rely on when you work at Apple and where. I was hired as a seasonal employee for the winter holidays in Los Angeles. It can be brutal with tourists bombarding you with question after question about discounts you are obviously unable to give them. I found the best people to work with to be the coworkers. They are diverse because Apple wants you to be diverse, which is nice, except that Apple's illusion of caring for diversity pretty much stops once it goes beyond the retail floor.
","The kool aid drinking is beyond imaginable. It is cult like. They push real hard the sentiment that Apple is The Best Company in the World to Work For and Look At How Much We Care About Things. I think the company genuinely has more compassion that a few other tech giants but that's not saying much, to be honest. Also some of the store managers have an over-inflated ego about being store managers for an Apple store. But whatever floats their boats I guess.
Advice to Management
Please hire more diverse employees in... like... your C-level positions. It doesn't really mean anything when the people running your company are about as spicy as polonaise but you're proud of how diverse your retail employees are. It just means you like to exploit our image.

My management team has been nothing but amazing and gives you nothing but all the tools you need to succeed.

Apple gives you big opportunitys to move up you just have to utilize the tools given to you.

The benefits are amazing

Better pay for top performing employees, maybe a better recognition system for the same thing. It seems sometimes that there is not an incentive to work harder than others.

","Unfortunately, the nature of front line support is you will get some very disgruntled people. 

Working on the bar you only get a set amount of time with each person depending on the issue they got booked in for, which aids a huge amount of pressure to what can be a already heated enivoment with a said disgruntled customer.

","It's hard to move up in the company because so many people apply for the same positions that are all just as qualified as you. Apple is good with not playing ""favorites"" but at the end of the day, the person who gets the promotion will be the person who networks better. Movement is about management liking you more than how well you perform. I don't see a way around that one. EVERYONE loves Apple who works there and gives it there all. There is no shortage of talent!

","Management doesn’t attend to employee needs for working internal tools

You work every holiday

Managers are basically astrologers that guess metrics and that’s it. 

No useful coaching towards the unreasonable goals and expectations 

Not given enough time to do the job.

Awful schedules that change every 3 months. Good luck having consistent events with friends! 

The customers are extremely harsh and the ability to meet their demands for service is impossible.
Advice to Management
The vender sites are the worst thing to happen to the companies support structure. Which vendors make up the vast majority of of the current support staff. They’re under trained and under paid. 

Working holidays is ridiculous when closures are customary. 

Management needs to be more accountable for ensuring advisors have resources and procedures along with understanding them. 

Procedural questions require answers. Not having someone capable of answering many different internal procedural questions looks like sloppy hiring. 

Hiring external managers that have never performed the role and expecting them to succeed is a recipe for failure.

breathe the values we supposedly talk about, walk the walk, don't just talk the talk
grow people into roles internally, and that doesn't mean people that joined yesterday, in many places you have people that have years within the company, groom them for those roles, they have accumulated so much value in their time there

When I worked there the culture was very much about eliminating a sense of hierarchy. I always had the support of management when I needed to escalate issues.
","You need to master the art of 'resetting your emotions' between each appointment. The appointments at the bar basically never stop during your shift and so this can take an emotional toll if you have back to back appointments with scathing/inconsiderate customers. It's a mixed bag though and sometimes the job can feel very rewarding.

2020-08-26, At,,"Current Employee, more than 5 years",Struggling to stay and feel valued after 6+ years,"-: The benefits are great. Dental, Vision, and health are just stellar. 
-: Reimbursement for gym is nice. 
-: Mental health support during COVID 19. 
-: Pay (DOE) is great. 
-: Great management. (There are some *amazing* ones)
","-: Arrogant managers. (It really is hit and miss) Report one and you may put a target on your back. 
-: Isolation when you work from home wears on you after years of doing this, inability to move up in the company (the more you want to progress the fewer options/places there are)
-: The company seems to be blending politics with the work place (keep it out Mr. Cook)
-: Mandatory overtime
-: Policies change on a whim and you have to master things fast
-: your friends and family use you as their personal Genius Bar even at 2 am...
-: Burn out is real. 

If you can’t adapt to change fast and work under pressure, this is not a job for you. And no - you don’t get insider news when new phones drop, new tech is released, etc.
Advice to Management
-: Back in the day we used to feel valued. We would get random gifts from management in the mail (I know we get points now but - it was a welcomed surprise to get a t-shirt or journal every now and again) 
-: Our team meetings felt more laid back just a few years back and we didn’t feel rushed and business only. 
-: Taking away the people factor from those we work with makes it hard to stay connected to our job. Not all of us want to be friends with coworkers outside of work on social media or via text but we wish to be connected AT work. We want to know if there’s a trend to calls, if people are having a bad day and not be punished for it so we can rally around them, talk about a difficult customer so we can help them through it and handle it better next time. It’s a luxury I guess at home advisors don’t get.

2020-08-20, Technical Specialist,"Covent Garden, England, England","Former Employee, more than 3 years",Its not what you think....,"- Fitness allowance
- Worked in a very talented collaborative team, can't emphasise this enough!
- Plenty of opportunity to level-up communication skills internally and with customers particularly in a flagship store
- Working in dynamic situations under competing pressures means similar situations in other contexts are a doddle now
- Attention to detail and people centred approach (to customer service & technology) Have not found this at other companies
","- HUGE disconnect between marketing and reality particularly in regards to diversity and inclusion. Sadly there's no real commitment to seriously support and celebrate all employees, address genuine disparities or to listen and act on feedback in this regard whether on a store level or Cupertino.
-Management: lack knowledge and competencies across all areas of store including in customer conflict deescalation and resolution, some have bullying/gate-keeperish line management style, make decisions without input of people on the ground, physical and mental wellbeing of staff is not a priority.
- Cult like company culture leads to inability to publicly express a range of thoughts and emotions even outside of work
- high turnover particularly of shop floor colleagues particularly at Xmas
- Poor life/work balance due to scheduling
- No real opportunities exist connecting corporate to retail arm
- Pay is extremely low for what you actually do
- Upwards progression non existent due to favouritism and bias
- Made to feel very disposable and exploited
- Told Metrics/KPIs are not so important when you join but you soon realise they are seen as most important thing - even above customer experience
- Genius Bar 'Resets' are supposed to be a short well-deserved rest but instead become the primary way training is delivered
Advice to Management
You will haemorrhage talent if you do not invest in development and progression, whilst compensating and recognising your team's passion and craft. 'Positive intent' and 'feedback' are used so selectively disadvantaging some of the most vulnerable in the team. Listen and include your employees more and stop infantilising them -we are the one's physically running the show.

Training staff and process is incredible. I absolutely loved my time with Apple and they gave me an amazing opportunity to grow myself both personally and professionally.
","Degraded culture, little managerial discretion, entry-level employees get away with absenteeism and poor ethical performance. However much of this is due to the large size of the company and court rulings that favor poor performing employees because ""Apple is so big is can take the hit when an employee calls out repeatedly"" however what they fail to realize is that when 20% of the staff is calling out repeatedly, it impacts the customer experience and makes managing attendance a nightmare. Additionally, there is very little growth that has been occurring at Apple for the last 3-4 for years. Some entry level employees that have completed apprenticeships and proven they are managerial material have had little to no opportunities as there have been no openings.

2020-08-11," Int Designer, Senior User Experience Designer, User Experience Engineer","Cupertino, CA","Former Employee, more than 3 years",Right for the wrong reasons,"- (subjective) As each of the 'most desireable' FANG companies has their own culture, Apple has theirs. Its a bit more low-key, professional and relaxed.
- after the initial shock of ""I work at Apple now"" fades away, work is work and your satisfaction/stress level will vary depending on your role, department, skill set and organization. I transferred between 3 different organizations - some very political, others like family. Sometimes within an org, 1 managers style (understanding, laid back - just expects quality work on time etc) would be a complete opposite of my coworkers under another manager (9-5 run like an agency)
- if you're ambitious there is opportunity - but also know there is a sautés quo and you are taking a risk. its up to you whether or not its worth it.
- looks great on your resume
","Alot of politics, I've seen entire agencies brought in for single projects where the end result was scraped. I've seen managers hire relatives and Apple outsources their 'investigations' department who get paid by how many people they accuse of violating policies.
Advice to Management
Not to all management, but to those who contract security teams and to whoever made the decision that your personal iCloud account becomes you work account. you find this out during orientation but by then its too late to create a new Apple ID.

There's no opportunity for separation of ""church and state"" and as I experienced a ""zero-tolerance"" policy was enacted, there was no announcement and I was interrogated for violating it after being an above average (based on performance reviews) employee for ~4 years.

","Over the years, management has added more and more responsibilities, to the point where we're jack of all trades, master of none, with no increase in pay. In chat support, they also periodically add a third chat which, for tech support, is impossible to handle without going crazy. Many of my coworkers have gotten injured or had to go on leave from stress. This was only stopped from being permanent by threats of unionization.

There is little to no career advancement.

Management is hit and miss. Your performance is also very arbitrary, and anything and everything that apple does is blamed on you. Customer has to pay for a repair? Your fault they're mad.

But be warned that going to school and working roughly 20hrs a week and no weekends can be tough. If you can handle stress of school and work I would highly recommend going for it. Looks great on the resume and sparks the convo even if it doesnt relate to what you are going for.
","Customers can be very tough to handle... Moving from retail to corp is very difficult but is possible. They offer ""internships"" for retail workers but you have to be full time to qualify and does not mean you will get the corp job in the end. Easy to become satisfied and some people lose the drive to move up for a promotion.

- Good pay for retail.
","- I had 3 days of training, then shoved onto the shop floor and didn't have a clue what I was doing (in terms of procedures to follow, using PoS systems, etc.)
- No communication between management and sales staff. Procedure would change sometimes multiple times a week and you wouldn't even know about it. 
-Belittling supervisors who think they're better than sales staff and even customers.
- Stressful work/life balance. I was a student at the time, doing 9 hour days and then commuting there and back. Be prepared to have to devote your entire life to the store.
Advice to Management
Train your staff. Tell some of your supervisors to get off their high horses - they aren't better than other people because they work at an Apple Store.

2020-07-17, Communications Team,"Cupertino, CA","Current Employee, less than 1 year",A is for Arrogance,"*Good salary & benefits
*Job stability at corporate
*Smart & some kind people if you look for them
*Good on your resume
*Opportunity to develop your political skills and patience
","*Incredibly hard to onboard (& everyone reminds you about this regularly) beyond superficial stuff like IT & basic corporate tasks, especially during COVID. *So so many 10++++ year or ""I've only worked at Apple"" people. Apparently there's an ""Apple Way"" to do things but there's also little documented so hard to figure out what that means. 
*Related there's a wide belief that Apple is somehow particularly special (in a way that doesn't prove out imo) & there's an arrogance that goes along with it. This is not a company that values humility or listening.
*Unbelievably siloed based on function & product. Most organizations & even the next level teams might as well be separate companies.
*Your experience will vary incredibly based on which organization & which team you end up on. Ask a lot of tough questions about that during the interviews. What characteristics are valued?
*Your experience will also vary incredibly based on your manager so do your due diligence & insist on a lot of time talking to the manager before you accept a job at Apple.
*Not a company that feels fun or where a sense of humour seems valued. Yes COVID complicates this but we are all still human not robots.
*A lot of time spent talking in committees that go nowhere.
Advice to Management
For a large global tech company Apple is strangely committed to being an in person, butts in seats culture & has not pivoted smoothly to virtual work. This old fashioned approach is legacy from Steve Jobs & the long term executives from what I can tell. Employees are enjoying the freedom to WFH & are already grumbling about why they will always need to be in the office. This could be a big retention issue post COVID.

2020-07-08, Senior ApplePay Advisor,"Elk Grove, CA","Former Employee, more than 10 years",Apple Advisor role is a great step towards a fruitful IT career,"• Very good leadership 
• Great training
• Positive team synergy
• Excellent benefits
• Awesome Employee Discounts
• Good HR Support
• Amazing brand recognition amongst family, friends, strangers, if discovered that you work for the company.
","•Difficult to move up in positions as the company grows (not impossible, just more challenging)
• Once capped out in salary in a role, there is a great diminishment in merit percentages at annual reviews - forces movement up, or laterally in position
• Sometimes near obsessive-micro management practices from management in regards to Advisors maintaining specific call-center metrics (its a call center!)
• Not enough education -empathy practices for Apple management to help them in better working with mental health and stress management issues amongst their Apple teams and groups.
Advice to Management
My aforementioned pros and cons are strictly from my own perspective and not influenced by anyone else. 
I know and personally appreciate and respect a good number of the upper-management, area managers and team managers, I've had the pleasure of meeting and working for, and I have nothing to say other than I do empathize at the incredible fortitude you each must have and maintain, to function in the roles and at the levels you do.

 So in understanding the majority of roles in Apple leadership, I've been exposed to, I will never speak negatively about Apple management - they are some of the better leadership I have experienced in any job ever worked, but always room for more improvement.

Cannot state much else, other than to encourage Apple leadership to continue innovating and learning from their mistakes and miscues and to, continue to always keep"" thinking different: because those good effective changes will eventually follow. I know they will because all my years with Apple I experienced spaces in time where I saw very good changes.

2020-07-06, Operations Program Manager,"Cupertino, CA","Former Employee, more than 8 years",Truly special and unequaled company that taught me an immense amount and changed my life,"• Incredible culture and drive to be and do the best at everything. Steve's simple yet powerful vision ""to make the greatest products in the world"" really did deliver.
• Special place to be and work alongside some really great and talented people. I was there for 8yrs and to this day have life long friends and trusted colleagues.
• IF you performed and achieved results, you could be compensated handsomely. This was obviously even more dramatic the earlier you joined (I joined around the time of the 1st iPhone). 
* Honestly, I miss so much about Apple despite it being my choice to leave. There was so much greatness there but I had to expand my horizons and in doing so have passed on immeasurable amounts of experience I gained while at Apple.
","• Like any organization, there were some true jerks. They were somewhat few and far between but upper management did not see this clearly and HR was not good about dealing with them EVEN when there were multiple points of feedback. I had a Director that was such a jerk that it caused me physical health issues not to mention the emotional and stress toll. Luckily I was young and could take this, but MANY people quit or tapped out, I watched it happen somewhat frequently. That said, these horrible experiences were balanced out by some incredible leaders who to this day set the bar for me. 
• Tons of travel can really wear on you. If you get good at it, you can manage it, but nothing is like being home consistently. The good news is the travel is somewhat by choice -- once you prove yourself you can move around internally to minimize this -- and it's comfortable (good airline seats, good hotels, good food, good people).
• Career growth is challenging since there are so many motivated, driven, capable people. Even when you believe -- and others tell you -- that you are a stand-out performer and leader, there's always jockeying for roles and it can be exhausting and demotivating.
Advice to Management
Apple is a very special place, do everything you can to preserve the good. 
When it comes to management, work really hard to root out the bad apples (pun intended) and promote the great leaders -- the ones that people want to put it all on the line for, they are there and they are obvious if you look. Results are very important, but not the only measure and should not outweigh how someone treats others or the morale impact of jerks on the organization. I routinely wondered why certain people weren't fired let alone why they were promoted. This can be done better and is key to ensuring Apple remains a compelling place to be and work.

","Management weren’t great, during training didn’t explain the system properly and didn’t explain you’d be reviewed on every minor detail, explained sales aren’t a big thing and great customer service is. However, they suddenly jump on you regarding sales of Apple care and certain products even when your customer service was incredible and you were always told to be authentic and not push products. Miscommunication.
Advice to Management
Be honest that you’re a sales driven company so the employers can focus on that, don’t sugar coat it so they then mess up in the long run for not meeting targets you didn’t even explain exist.

Advice to Management
As a retail store, focus on developing your team wherever he or she may want to go in the future. Instead of treating staff like pawns, develop their skillsets and help to advance careers. Not enough opportunity is given for retail employees to grow. Employees are stuck in same roles for several years. Add more diversity to leadership roles and ease off of the micromanaging to drive numbers. Every team member goes through the most rigorous interview journey and employees are the best of the best.

Be more upfront about the sales aspect of the position. I know Apple doesn’t like to call it “sales”. But that’s what it is.

","Don't be fooled by the 'Everything is awesome' vibe the managers try to put on, office politics are very real in every store and even though you will get along with most of your coworkers, you are competing with them if you want to advance anywhere.
Demands from head office feel very out of touch with what is actually happening in stores.
Managers get moved/removed often due to performance, politics, etc. so get what you can from a manager that you connect with because you never know how long it will last.
In 8 years of working at Apple, I've only heard of 2 people moving to corporate and both were due to connections to district management; if that was your plan to get into corporate I would highly reconsider that path.

Advice to Management
You get to keep what you pay for. Also, so many people were chosen by the ""feeling"" of the hiring manager, most of which this was their first job. I would suggest some mentoring before giving them this responsibility.

","- They don’t “let go” of people - which they should. There’s a few characters that honestly should have been let go a while ago.

Advice to Management
Take away promotions from store leaders. Make it where there is an oversight committee for all of promotions internally. Make the process of coming from part-time to full-time less about how many people you know and if the store leader likes you or not and more about your work ethic and numbers. Figure out why good people are leaving the company and try not to do it again. Have all store leaders go through a training program about diversity in the workforce, how to deal with generational diversity in workforce, and how to become a more effective leader. Make it less about the brand and more about the people. The way that the company has turned in recent years has been more number-centric instead of people centric like it has been in the past

Make it less about the brand and more about the people. The way that the company has turned in recent years has been more number-centric instead of people centric like it has been in the past

2020-05-15, Embedded Software Engineer,"Cupertino, CA","Current Employee, more than 1 year",Great company with a culture that takes getting used to,"One thing I’ve learned from talking to people within Apple is your experience will greatly vary, depending on your organization. I’m a software engineer in the Core OS organization within SWE, so my review only applies to that.

People outside Apple like to poke fun when senior leadership publicly says they’re trying to be customer-centric and “do the right thing” while making decisions that go in to products. After being here, I truly believe that is the case! Tim and Craig have proven to be very thoughtful, honest and effective leaders

We work on some tough technical problems and some really innovative technology.

At the end of the day, as an individual contributor I am enabled to put my head down and do my best work. Apple can be demanding, expect to receive emails and pings on nights and weekends. You have to learn to set boundaries and stick to them. If you enjoy your work, like I do, it’s very easy to accidentally put too many hours in
","As with lots of tech companies, there are many different personalities to deal with and some can make your job miserable. It sounds like being in middle management is extremely political and there are management movements / re-orgs pretty often.


Apple culture can be difficult to navigate for some. There’s very little documentation (this is improving), and the company is entirely built on making relationships and hallway conversations. This can make working in remote offices difficult, from what I’ve heard. Introverts beware!

","Micromanagement. They tend to focus on the one negative customer who left a net promoter survey for unrealistic expectations while ignoring the dozens of other customers who scored you a top score. Conversations begin with ""What could you have done better?"" while ignoring the multitudes of customers who scored you high. Plus, apple doesn't promote managers from within. They prefer people who don't know the culture from Target, Starbucks, or Gap. They ignore people who know the culture, know the systems, and know the people. New managers often leave rather quickly

","tough schedule, overbearing management, constant flow of calls without many breaks. AppleCare is unique at Apple, and unlike any other department. While in AppleCare, you will be treated like a secondhand employee. Management will micromanage you, and if you are not taking a certain amount of calls per hour, will often talk to you. In other departments, Apple treats its employee's with a much more open ""start up culture vibe"", where employee's have the ease of a creative space. Not in AppleCare however. You are there to take calls and that is it. I would think of AppleCare culture more in line with a pyramid scheme or MDM culture, where your existence is simply to meet numbers. I have to quit simply for the mental anguish. Apple is a great company, and I still love Apple products and upper level management. If possible join another org.

","Apple is good but so so in Turkish management.
There is micro management and managers are nir focused on people management. Some poeple are luckyly on good positions without any skills, some of them still trying. Management require you to have a great quality buy supporting its customers but inside of high levels are not quality to manage staff. They know what they want but they are not giving the same.working environent does not allow you to focus your customer, it force you to focus more KPI or quality standards and that micro management make you feel very bad. For Apple, customer is first prioraty but for Turkish unsuccesful micto management, KPI are first prioraty:) sometimes you find yourself in a very funny position by discussion stupid and nit apple way things with your manager. People are working in a stressful working standards
Advice to Management
Please do not give that much responsible to managers. Speaking all issues during woking hours is very boring. Also please create some platform for advisors to rate also its managers after meetings etc. it will be better way to keep people more safe and comfortable

2020-04-09, Software Engineer,"Sunnyvale, CA","Former Employee, more than 3 years",Here are the bad things,"Great pay, great benefits and you have Apple on your resume.
","Reviews are accurate, all of the bad ones at least. They use a lot of OFFSHORE contractors, and high percentage are not good, same for the managers, they used to be not so good contractors and are managers now.

Is not usually bad to use contractors due to the flexibility of scale up and down on people, but when you have 5 employees and 15 contractors and they just come and go, you don't really have that flexibility, it's the same 15 positions but filled but people that are taken to extreme burn out and writing code and creating designs worst than recent grads. Engineer quality is the worst I've ever seen in my life overall with 18 YOE. Are there good folks there? Yes, absolutely, but when you have 5 employees and 15 contractors and 50% suck and are OFFSHORE in India on a completely different timezone you are in for a mess and a career hara-kiri. 

Unless you are making much less than the current TC offered, I would advise against it. It doesn't matter the team, trust me on that, I have experienced and interacted with several teams, it's all the same. If TC is significantly higher take it, and leave soon to similar paying company. I'm looking for my way out.

All the contractors are from Tata Consulting and Infosys, those guys are suffering and being exploited. 100% of the people I've interacted with are Indians, diversity is 0%, it's incredible, you feel like you are in India yourself, never seem this in my life and I've worked in all the MAGAF.
Advice to Management
If you are going to have contractors, why not have them at least on similar timezone? Contractors are good for flexibility of scale resources up and down, but if you have a contractor for 5 years that mean it was never a temporary necessity, why have it at all if it wasn't quality engineer?

","Taking three chats at once is difficult. You can't adequately provide optimal service and support to all three. Jumping between customers at the same time is more than fine and quite doable. Adding the third person results in a stressed out adviser. As well as customers that may not get the best support. There was limited advancement from the technical tier 2 positions.
Advice to Management
Limit the chat interaction to two people at the same time. The negative impact to the waiting customers and the stress it induces in the advisers, is not work it.

","This best thing about this job was the pay and the team members. After 6 months they start switching you around like clothes to other managers and groups. During winter and summer, full time is a huge pain because you literally work from home but can’t spend time with your family on the holidays since most of your day is taken by this job. The customers are ruthless, rude and use vulgar language this company cares more about what angry biased customers think than the employees. Most of your job performance is based on people that either don’t like the companies policies and give you a bad review or people asking you to take out a magic wand and grant their “impossible” wish. The managers are big on favoritism and they start tearing you apart once you let them know they can’t control you like the rest of the team. The tier 2 advisors and disgusting as well and take every chance to make you feel dumb for trying to do your job or not knowing something. This job starts off well but ends up to be a circus based off of how high you can jump to make the customer happy. The 8 hour shifts are grueling and having a kind customer was very rare for me. Being in college and dealing with a job like this was absolutely stressful and they don’t care for you to have a life. The hours to take off are limited and they literally try to penalize you for taking off WITHOUT pay when there are literally no more hours left to put in! The pay was always good but not all money is good money because this job is very stressful and has a lot of surprises that come up along the way. This job only sees you as a robot that should take verbal abuse from higher management and customers, no one should have to experience what I have from this job so please choose wisely.
Advice to Management
Make the advisors performance based off of them as an advisor and not how angry customers feel about them following company policies and telling them “no”. Make the time off more accessible to all and not just first come first serve. Also try to keep people in groups instead of switching them all the time once they get comfortable, being with an unsupportive manager also effects performance.

2020-03-30, Apple Retail Specialist,"London, England, England","Former Employee, more than 1 year",So much fun 😊,"Really loved working at the Covent Garden store in London. The culture around Apple overall is amazing, and I wish all companies and employers were like this. Because it’s so important to work and get along with the people you see often at your job, and especially when things get really intense with the sheer volume of customers, it’s so good to have the balance of quality people working alongside you. I made incredible friends there, and when I have my own business, I hope to create an environment as accepting and fun and hardworking as what I had with Apple. Being able to speak with your manager as your equal is so important because it shows the respect throughout the entirety of the store between everyone working there, and all aiming to achieve the same end goal. And literally the most fun I ever had at a job!! So grateful! 

Another pro is that Apple really values customers as people, as employees are. There’s no forced sales on anyone. As specialists our jobs are to *inform* customers about products and services. It’s about having that conversation with them and getting to know them so you can better direct them to their needs. This really stood out for me because it wasn’t about selling the products, but really helping people. That’s a big passion of mine 😊
","Retail anywhere can be exhausting and overwhelming. I’m just glad Apple is the way it is to make it so much better and bearable. I wish the way retail operates in general should change. It’s a very long time being in your feet. By the time you finish your shift, you suddenly stop rushing around and you feel like you could collapse. Not to take into account the commute back home, where I had to take the tube and bus. Once again, glad Apple made working so much better and the people around you made the day go by so much quicker.

","Ultimately, I did not like the interactions with my manager. The guy clearly was not an experienced manager. He did not understand anything about my work and was not helpful. My feeling was he became manager because his manager was also from the same ethnic group as he was.
Advice to Management
Your company is very big, multilingual employees come from diverse backgrounds. I admire that part. However, the managers working in Cupertino area at least should be well-versed in English. They can come from different ethnicity, but should have enough confidence in the culture of their country of immigration. If your policy is to protect your managers, then please try to train them rigorously in order to instill certain values in them. Please remember employees are the biggest asset an organization can have.

2020-03-24, Tier One Adviser,,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",Super rude customers and bug ridden products,"There are none, just cons and more than I actually wrote.
","Customers, pay rate, products, schedules, lack of updated information, customers that don't know what technical support is and isn't. Surveys that are not disputed when you've given the customer the right information and it's clear they're mad with Apple and not the customer service representative or they were rating the wrong rep, but it still applies to your stats. Trainers don't give you the correct information, so when you start taking calls, you're teaching yourself. Customers call about things not related to their products performance, that they should be paying for, adding emails, checking calendars, how to backup devices, why calendars go to past dates, what their Apple ID is, support for vintage devices, third party apps/products recommendations, cellular service, cost of upgrading devices to later model on the tech support line instead of calling sales. Customer assuming everyone they talk to works directly for Apple, and they know how much we make, so we should kiss their butts, and allow them to be rude and demeaning no matter what. Their products require a pc and they don't tell customers that, so when they call to erase a passcode or backup with iTunes, they think they can do those things from their device or another apple product. Letting customers know how much it will cost for a service appointment. Customers asking us to track their products, we can’t it’s a privacy issue. Tools we’re supposed to use never work, but they still want us to ask the customer if they would like to use it, then we have to tell them it’s updating, and not down because they don’t want customers to know there’re resources don’t work much like their products. Rude Tier 2 advisers (senior advisers) who don't want to take the call or will hang up when it comes on their line, or that give you the wrong information.
Advice to Management
Advertise about your products and how to use them, not the brightest bulbs buying your items. Stick to the 90 day tech support plan, so that customers don't use tech support as a crutch. If you want your employees to move up, train them properly, more money doesn't equal happiness. A new position just means more stuff I'm suppose to know but don't, with this company.

Apple is a great company to work for and they take care of their employees. I worked in the college care program and they would work around our school schedules and they required us to work 20 hours a week. The pay is way more than the average college student receives from an hourly job. The company is flexible and they give out free things all the time. On numerous occasions, I would get a package from Apple and it would be a free gift and I would never realize I was getting it. Also, the discount is pretty awesome especially on their services.
","The only downside of working at Apple is you are expected to perform. They offer ample opportunities for coaching and can help you along the way but if you are still struggling you will get ""let-go"". Apple takes care of their employees really well and you are expected to excel at your job.

2020-03-17, Genius,,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",High Highs and Low Lows,"-Good pay BUT not consistent across all at the same job title/tenure
-Benefits available for full and part time employees
-Generous stock grants (RSUs)
-Good maternity/paternity leave policy
-I have been told the health insurance is great, although I did not personally use it so I can't say firsthand. 

Overall, Apple Retail has some high highs and low lows. I tried to document my experience as well as possible, and honestly ended up writing much more than I had originally intended. I do want to add the disclaimer that although there is a big block of text in the ""CONS"" section, I did enjoy working at Apple. I liked my job there, paid me well and I got valuable experience. Was it something I'd do as a career? No. Was it a good stepping stone in my professional development? Absolutely. I write this feedback not to slander Apple but to give a genuine account of my experience, prepare others who are considering joining Apple, and hopefully help Apple Retail improve for the sake of all Apple employees. 

At Apple, I had the privilege of meeting people with all kinds of different backgrounds, education levels, and experiences. Even now that I have moved on, several of my mentors at Apple continue to push me to improve. I can genuinely say that Apple was the most diverse company I have ever worked for, and yet it wasn’t a gimmick or to fill a quota. It felt like you could be your genuine self and I would say that I felt very welcome there. 

I experienced a tremendous amount of personal and professional growth during my time there. If you had asked me before I started, I would never have described myself as a leader and yet by the end of my time at Apple, I had led initiatives, coached/mentored my peers, and established myself as a leader, resource, and mentor. I learned how to talk about myself and the work I’m doing in a concise way (STAR / SBO). I learned how to collaborate with people with different work styles from my own, how to provide feedback in different ways based on how the person best receives it, and I learned how to challenge and be challenged without damaging my relationship with my colleagues. I learned a lot about my own worth as an employee and how to advocate for myself. I learned to seek to understand, to approach mistakes as opportunity for shared growth rather than an opportunity to place blame, and how to be empathetic even when it is easy not to be. 

Some of the best managers I’ve ever had were from Apple. These managers were not afraid to jump into the fray when we were at our busiest. They empowered my colleagues and I to make the call in a tough situation and backed us up on whatever we felt was best. They trusted us to do our jobs well and always sought to understand before giving feedback or calling out problems if they arose. They went to bat for us against managers who were quick to dismiss our talents.
","For context, I was one of the top repair technicians and consistently rated within the top 3 in the store for repair quality and timeliness from the time I received my ACiT (Apple Certified iPhone Technician) certification. I passed my ACMT (Apple Certified Mac Technician) certification with a 97% (68 questions correct out of 70). In addition, I have prior experience building computers and have a solid grasp on how computers work / what hardware components do. 

No repercussions for calling off so it wasn’t uncommon for 5-6 people to call off a day.

At the Genius Bar, they consistently prioritized personality types over technical skill when considering candidates. Storewide, great candidates were consistently passed over in favor of more vocal candidates. It was also not uncommon for managers to play favorites, and some managers would actually do their best to undermine your development if they didn’t like you.

I believe that while skills can be taught, attitude is a key point of your personality and is not so easily changed. However, for this model of hiring the person, not the skill, there needs to be sufficient training to get the person up to a functional standpoint. I would say Apple has done a lackluster job when it comes to technician training the past few years. Genius (Mac technician) training consists of two weeks off the sales floor doing self-guided online trainings (few of which that actually apply to the service being provided), a certification assessment, and a week of repair shadowing. After that point, the new Genius can do their first repair ON A CUSTOMER'S MACHINE. Customers pay a lot of money for the products and a lot of money for repairs. It is absolutely unacceptable that the first computer a technician takes apart is a paying customer's machine. In addition, nearly all of the other Geniuses had no computer experience outside the Genius Bar. The troubleshooting process for most of my former peers is just pattern matching reported symptoms with support guides and regurgitating solutions. 

Despite being the youngest Genius on my team and the least tenured in the role, I regularly had to fix the mistakes of my peers. Some examples of repair mistakes include putting screws in the wrong location, not plugging in antenna / mic / camera / battery connectors before marking a repair as ready for customer pickup, not taking security precautions when dealing with batteries, leaving ESD sensitive components sitting out uncovered for hours at a time, bending a pin on a logic board, and more. I also had to reset customer expectations after one of my peers advised a customer that her new iMac wouldn’t run any faster than her 2013 iMac because they both had HDDs. The issue the customer was experiencing was no more related to the HDD than Java is related to Javascript (read: not related at all). In the end, I was able to fix the issue but the customer had clearly lost faith in the Genius Bar and honestly, I can’t blame her for that. 

The biggest issue though, in my opinion, was the inconsistency in management. The managers were either amazing or the worst, no in between. See my experience with the good ones in the “Pros” section. The bad managers, though, were awful. Micromanagement, lack of trust, and blatant favoritism were common. These managers clearly prioritized the customer in the store rather than the customer with a device awaiting repair. Mac repair consisted of 1-3 technicians (normally 1 on weekdays, 2 on fri/sat, 3 for special occasions), occurred only once per day for 2-3 hours maximum (normally 2), and yet at least one Mac technician was pulled to the floor early on a nearly daily basis causing a never-ending cycle of late repairs and angry customers. 

The store leader was the worst, in my opinion. They had no knowledge of Genius Bar processes yet frequently made (impossible) requests of the technicians. Example: a customer came in with a device with no accessible device identifier (missing SIM tray = no IMEI, would not turn on so no S/N, and the serial reader tool didn’t retrieve anything from the phone). The customer was advised that ideally the SIM tray would be needed or at minimum a proof of purchase to service the device as the internal ticketing system was tied to the device identifier (SN) and there was no way to create a repair / replacement for the device without it, even as a customer service exception. The customer started to escalate and get visibly upset, so the store leader got involved and after being informed of the situation, advised the technician to just replace the phone (a common exception when a customer is escalated). Except that there was no possible way to systematically replace the phone. Even if the technician took a phone off the shelf and gave it to the customer, there would still be a litany of issues preventing the customer from using the replacement. This is only one of countless examples.

2020-03-11, Genius,"Los Angeles, CA",Former Employee,It’s what you make of it,"The biggest pro about working with Apple is the benefits.
Health insurance is top tier with nominal premiums.
RSUs, ESPP, EPP+, discounts on cell services, discounts with retailers and lots of other perks. 
Gym reimbursement if you don’t work on any of the campuses, bike reimbursement, or pays for commuter services.
The company is there for their employees during natural disasters, etc. 
Free legal advice if you’re going through matters outside of work.
Free therapy sessions if needed throughout the year. 
So many free or highly discounted services and products provided to us. 

In addition, the amount of opportunity for growth to corporate is unparalleled. If you leverage a career experience or mentor ship well enough, there’s no way you won’t open doors to corporate. (from a retail level)
","At the retail level, it’s turned into a “good old boy” hierarchy. Market team leaders being brought in from clothing or big box retailers, hiring all their old buddies as lower leadership. It’s how our retail culture is being lost. Positive intent only thrives within employees that are considered “legacy” thinkers. And “legacy” thinkers don’t get promoted. Work/Life balance does not exist within Apple Retail, even for part timers. 

At the corporate level, it’s a scramble to fill positions. So we’ve hired so many people that aren’t top tier talent anymore. Friends hiring friends for the sake of friendship, instead of how they can actually perform. Pay is also not as competitive as other companies in SF/Bay Area/San Jose. 

They don’t like hiring from within for management positions. There are some really great employees and people that I worked with that should’ve been management a long time ago, but they’re quickly passed over.
Advice to Management
Promote from within, invest in the development and promotion of employees that have busted their butt for the company for decades. Be honest and truthful with feedback, don’t just sandwich people with BS.

2020-03-10,,,Current Employee,"Great pay, smart people, high standards, but poor work-life balance, poor management, and lack of healthy culture","Highest paying employer in hardware by far. Mostly consists of smart and hardworking people, with very high standards for quality all around, which motivate you to work harder, more thoroughly, and think deeper than I ever have before. Apple also pushes you to learn how to be bold, demand highest quality in service and engineering work from coworkers and vendors, it promotes a culture of candid, instant feedback, and accountability. Working at Apple is fierce, can be militant like at times, but it will toughen you up and teach you a work ethic and approach of rigor likely unparalleled.
","The demands for work load and quality are so high it can be extremely exhausting, stressful, and bad on your health and life outside of work. You are generally expect to not have a life outside of work during the work week. In some hardware groups you will be working until 10p-2am every night.
Advice to Management
Continue to keep the standards of quality high, but put more emphasis on work life balance and promoting healthier practices. Managers seem to be promoted mostly on technical ability and strongest ability to articulate problems, find solutions, and ability to put people in their place, lead meetings and discussions most fiercely. However not much emphasis seems to be put on promoting leaders who are good at motivating people in a healthy way, instead they promote motivation by fear / aggressive deadlines. 

Incorporate healthier practices into management training. Lead by example. Teach managers to motivate people through positive encouragement rather than negative punishment and fear.

","They micromanage metrics at every level. Its said it’s not a sales job but it absolutely is. You have to sell their services from AppleCare+ to Apple Arcade (which is a joke). And if you are 1% off of your metrics you get talked to. They justify it stating that this is a “for profit” company. Duh! All companies want to make a profit and I think Apple is doing just fine in terms of profit.
Advice to Management
The call it “leadership” but they don’t lead in any way. Micromanagement at every level. Why hire people if you don’t trust them to do the job they’ve been hired to do?? The management at the retail stores are simply drones for their corporate bosses.

Apple Retail is a great starter job to fine tune certain competencies and areas of your personal and professional life. Easy work environment with a large support system.
","Retail work environment, which results in dealing with the public in a large capacity. Intense feeling of being treated like a child. No relocation packages for retail employees who wish to transfer. High level of internal politics. A ""blanket pay scale"" that doesn't take into account the specific duties and responsibilities of each job title or employee. No work-from-home benefits or free lunches.

Management has been overall good. They typically leave you be when they feel that you're confident in your role. My advice would is: be more proactive in getting to know your employees on a one-to-one basis. Proactively plan for their present and future at Apple or beyond.

2020-02-18, Technical Specialist,"San Francisco, CA","Former Employee, more than 1 year",Good for retail but not for long term,"Benefits are okay if you're full-time. Part time employees at the apple store are kind of disposable. The pay is decent considering it is a retail store work environment.
","Management is pretty manipulative for the most part. An effective system is set in place within the Apple retail environment that makes it easy to manipulate employees on the ground level into staying for long periods of time. 

Easy to move up if you are on the good side of leadership, people who move up set a compelling example towards people who want to move up. Solid popularity contest that is extremely beneficial to extroverts and quirky people.

Having weekends off isn't possible.

2020-02-18, Specialist,"Boston, MA","Former Employee, more than 3 years",Excellent People,"-Coworkers are smart, fun, and supportive
-Lots of opportunities to grow in your role
-Typically hire internally for promotions

The things I miss most about working at Apple are the people I worked with. I liked nearly everyone I worked with and felt supported both as a colleague and as a person. While the job was often very challenging, it was also very rewarding.
","-It's retail: customers can be very difficult. 
-Working in a company that is always in the spotlight has its challenges
-Good starting pay for retail, but compensation is not close to the amount of money I made for Apple.

It could be a fairly high stress environment at times, particularly on weekends, during launches, and during the holiday season. Also, be careful who you tell that you work for Apple. Everyone has an opinion about Apple, and sometimes they want to pick a fight.

2020-02-16, Product Zone Specialist,"New York, NY","Current Employee, less than 1 year",At the end of the day it is a sales job.,"Great on-boarding process, even for part time season workers. Lots of classic Apple, feel good, cult vibe. Company mission is lofty. Relatively flat managerial hierarchy means you can approach anyone on the floor for help without getting an ""That's not my job"" or ""I'm too important to ask"" attitude. The majority of my co-workers were friendly and helpful. Again, very little attitude towards new people. Met some interesting and friendly folks.

25% discount for you. 10% discount for friends and family.

People team kept things interesting with fun and weekly events.

$19 hr decent rate for retail.

Upfront about seasonal work opportunities to stay and general attitude towards workers.
","If you ever buy anything at Apple and get a survey PLEASE FILL IT OUT. You have no idea how much it means to the person who sold you your device. Fill out the whole thing!

After all the rah rah APPLE IS GREAT dies down it is a sales job. For the most part Apple products sell themselves. Most people tend to know what they want. They come to the store for the Apple experience. After that you're being judged on stuff like adding AppleCare+, Apple Business introductions and other metrics. 

Training feels rushed. 3 weeks of partial drilling of sales highlights. Too much to know for the incredibly complicated world of products, cell phone plans, AppleCare+ and Genius Bar. Basically they pound you full of the overview and you'll pick up the rest on the floor. 

Seasonal workers are exposed to the benefits and perks of the full time employees but can't participate. Feels bad. You get some of the benefits but not others and it is often not clear.

Had more experienced staff snipe business referrals from customers I was working with.

I had one interaction with my team leader in 4 months. Nice guy but felt very uninterested in our team growth. I'd be curious to see what the retention was per team related to the team leaders.

Had coworkers tell me they avoided taking customers who appeared to be from abroad due to the likelihood that they wouldn't be able to attach AppleCare+ to a sale and drive down their numbers. Managers seem to be oblivious to that fact.

Constant drumbeat for retail employees to care and give back to the community with employee donations and volunteering. Asking people making $25k a year to donate and volunteer for things felt weird. While they are all very earnest and good causes, they should be teaching financial planning seminars more often. The amount of coworkers spending their paychecks back into Apple was astounding.

Seasonal workers are expected to put in time on their own development despite not having access to the tools the full time staff have. It is unclear when you're supposed to put in this time as your work week if fully scheduled.

Advice to Management
Management should be comprised of employees who have worked their way up. The practice of hiring managers from other retail environments does not lend itself to a workplace like an Apple Store. There is so much about working at an Apple Store that is unlike any other retail environment - management really should be experienced employees. Additionally, management should be required to work every position in the store before finishing their training as managers. Finally, the ""store leaders"" (general managers) should really be required to be in the store more.

possibly introduce a type of flexi work where employees have the option to come on site for training days or a few days a month to get to know other staff. I honestly loved working for Apple. I learned a lot and developed so much professionally. I would go back in a heartbeat if it was onsite and off the phones but the opportunities just weren't there. One thing to be aware of is at home advisers are great for the reduction of environmental impact which is a wonderful thing Apple invest in, but 5 years of talking to nobody and spending 9 months on a team where I was never scheduled to have a team meeting with my team and never actually meeting them was adding to an isolating depression. I loved my job but had to leave for my own mental health. Working at home for long periods of time is not sustainable.

Tuition reimbursement would help me with one semester, matching 401k, employee stock program, paid time off, discounts for friends, family and yourself in the Apple store. All around good benefits.
","Very repetitive. I would receive at least 8 calls a day from people who forgot their passwords. Some customers can get very angry and upset for their own misuse of their phone/computer and then take their frustration out on the advisor. I heard some negative things about some of the managers from other coworkers, but my manager was great. 

Another con is that they don’t acknowledge any of the public holidays except for New Years. Expect to work over the 4th of July, Thanksgiving, and yes, even Christmas.

2020-02-01, Outlet Supervisor,"Littleton, CO","Current Employee, more than 3 years","Great job, but intense!","Very dynamic job - every day was different, lots of different customers, problems, obstacles to adapt to, etc. The job also paid well, and had amazing benefits even for part-timers.
","Could be very intense at times - I dealt with some sensory overload when I first started - music playing over the speakers, videos playing on every screen, conversations all around you, your one-on-one conversation with the person in front of you, and the conversation in the headset that you are wearing all at once. It took a while for me to get used to it. Also, needing to keep up with all of the current information regarding products, tech demos, phone company plan changes, etc. was quite a lot of work.
Advice to Management
Great job overall, but would have welcomed more in-depth (and hands-on) training before sent out into the wild - so to speak.

2020-01-31, Siri Grading Analyst,"Austin, TX","Current Employee, more than 1 year","At the very least, It’s a Job","- You get to tell people you work at Apple 
- The campus is pretty nice.
- Variety of food options 
- Benefits kick in on the first day 
- You don’t have to do anything because they can’t track productivity. 
- You will get paid on time. 
- Everyone is welcoming, and wonderful 
- Apple has Resources to help expand your career. 
- Enough free time to interview for other jobs. 
- Free beats headphones (For work) 
- Potentially the most stress free job ever.
","- You don’t actually have to work. For this role, there is no way of tracking productivity. So people who actually do work and people who sit around loafing all day are essentially the same. 

- No deadlines, deliverables or goals. So you will just feel like you’re wasting time. 

- Only 12 sick days a year. And you have to earn them on an hourly, per pay check basis. 

- This is an hourly role. So you’ll be treated like a child. You’ll be told exactly when to take your lunch and breaks. Even though the job is pretty much online and should allow for more flexibility. Also they will make it very evident that they don’t trust you with organization secrets. Apple in general is very paranoid. 

- Archaic practices. This job is literally online. It can be done from literally anywhere and any communication required could be done online. However, there are no options to work from home, or even an open workspace at the office. You will not be given a laptop. You will have a desktop and will have to work from an uncomfortable desk. Management is not open to the flexibilities of this day and age. 

- They’ll tell you they want feedback, but they really don’t. 

- Communication is very manual. Managers will literally go around to every one or yell for everyone to gather for a meeting, instead of using all the technology available to us. This is really just funny to watch. 

- Managers aren’t really that important. They can barely get any answers to any work problems. They’re just as in the dark as we are.
Advice to Management
- Instead of spending millions on renting large work spaces, and moving locations every six months, assign everyone a laptop and headphones and privacy screen and let them work from wherever. 

- Have a structured plan in place before setting up a role. This job is clearly a “work through it as we go” project. 

- Have some method of measuring productivity and performance. 

- Everything else is great. We our obviously second class Apple employees, and the job itself is mind numbing; but no one can really complain about being paid to sit in a air conditioned office and do nothing.

Treat your front-line employees like those in tech support and customer relations with a little more respect and humility. Company-funded parties and contests for free swag are great, but employees need reliable schedules that don't change every few months. They need concrete paths toward growth based on merit and not by the luck of having a great manager or carefully curated network of fellow employees and managers from other departments. Invest more in the needs of your people and stop throwing random free stuff at them. Invest in the tools they use.

Even managers would give one-off plain robotic corporate responses to meetings or questions. It's like everyone has one single functioning brain cell. They don't divulge personal life or do anything interesting with their life in general. Repeat the same stale processes or answer technical questions over and over. Customers come in thinking they can yell at you to get what they want. Or they think they know your job better. Management has nothing better to do than hover over their subordinates and nitpick/lord it over. Type A personalities that love to stick it to you if you do anything wrong in their eyes. You can't disagree from their collective opinions. You're being watched all the time. They espouse that ""we're all family"" and constantly repeat the desired belief in the cultish ""Apple values"" a la carte quotes every-major-company-ever uses to lure in its employees' brand loyalty. Pay is terrible considering it's a multi-billion dollar company. Zero work life balance. They'd rather you make them your #1 priority over school, family, and home. Apple is a shady company exactly like everyone else. Just with more profit off the brainless public. If they have to repeatedly insist they are ""different"" and that ""they're family"" they're saying oxymorons. No upward movement. People that worked there for years made the same pay as I did when I barely started. If Apple can take advantage of your work, blind loyalty, time, and take over your life they absolutely will. Perfect for type-A personalities that care too much about what others are doing.

You will not grow in the company if you ever go on medical leave. You will be stuck forever in your role. You need to avoid working here if you’re mentally unwell.

","Working at Apple is intoxicating at first. But the shine quickly fades. Its a madhouse. Its always busy. People hate and love the stores. Once you move to the repair side it becomes so hard to maintain your positivity, especially if you are stuck in a front line position as long as I was. It will consume your soul. It left me with PTSD and a feeling of worthlessness, even though I was truly Good at my job. Unrealistic expectations for customer approval ratings in a very very tough position. The position evolved from a few key functions when I started into a multitude of repair and sales functions, emphasis on the sales. If you do not like playing the popularity game, you will not grow. Apple is rapidly becoming another mediocre retail corporation in how it runs and manages its stores. And the corporate culture is Cult-Like. That is all.
Advice to Management
Its painful watching store managers bend the knee to Corporate and regional execs. Its incredibly painful to be turned down for promotion after promotion for 6 years, knowing I had a family to support, and knowing I worked hard for Apple for years while trying to maintain a positive outlook after each successive denial of promotion. As the retail schedule ate away my precious time with my family and caused havoc with basic things like school events, and any sort of regularly scheduled activity, or even just being able to tell my baby and wife good night. It hurt how Apple depended on me to cover for Geniuses at the Genius Bar multiple nights a week for years, but didn't value me enough to make me an actual genius. To validate all the late nights and going above and beyond for our customers and my coworkers. 
Keep things like that in mind the next time you deny a long term employee an opportunity in a new role. Its the newness and the challenge that keep your usually intelligent employees engaged and excited. But only if they fit the mold Apple approves right? Give people a chance, please.

2020-01-10,Anonymous,,"Former Employee, more than 3 years",NPI Program Manager with direct reports,"Hard to find a place taking on more aggressive challenges and actually delivering on them. The work is intellectually engaging and the personal accountability is extremely high. 
Extremely collaborative and team oriented work environment. 
The products are simply world class. 
Many perks due to the company’s largess: bus service, discounts, high degree of luxury in the workplace, esp. at Apple Park.
","The job does not sleep. If you are in product operations, you are always on in one way or another (calls w/ suppliers in Asia, exec reviews, preparation for exec reviews). This is the culture and the way of life at Apple. Hard for employees in some stages of life to balance work and home commitments. Not much improvement in this respect over 4 years, despite the problem being well known by the leadership.
Advice to Management
Reconsider leadership education at Apple completely. Leadership is about people, not just results. Leaders at Apple seem to be woefully behind their peers in other organizations in the people Leadership department. The net effect is a an organization that seems to care about one thing: hit the number and don’t give bad news to your boss. With the talent Apple has on board, you can strive for much higher goals than that.

","Management can be overbearing, can be extremely stressful as unless it's a dry period, there is little to no time between calls and your brain just can't rest. You are micromanaged down to the second and it wears on you because you constantly feel like you're being watched and it makes it hard to focus on the problem and solve the issue how you would normally solve it because if you don't do something, even if it's not necessary, you'll get an email requesting a one on one meeting with your team manager.
Advice to Management
Ease up on the micromanaging of people's time, especially the home advisors. It's bad enough that your house begins to feel like a prison, it's made worse when you can't even take a bathroom break without being asked about a 30 overage to wash your hands.

Stock and benefit options are really great and you get to work with a lot of wonderful open minded people as well as having a decent work life balance for the most part.

retail is a good place to start if you are just starting college and interest in sales or technology, so long you don't mind a bit of chaos. I do recommend corporate as it is more down to earth and open compared to retail.
","Costumers are often allowed to be extremely aggressive and down right abusive which can bring a lot of stress and anxiety, especially for the technical specialists who are required to be empathetic to all they help.

It can also be hard to get full time or even move out of current roles unless you have a good connection with your leadership team or fit a certain personality type. leadership will often sway employees into roles they want them in.

hard to get dedicated training for required knowledge and often have to learn on the fly which often breeds bad habits and misinformation.

finally company's goals and values between retail and corporate often clash and causes much confusion for customers and employees alike.
Advice to Management
Dial back on the forced empathy and the philosophy of fixing the customer before fixing the problem. Maybe provide better service options to customers so they do not filled trapped and obligated to pursue pricey and often timely solutions.

offer more dedicated training and career opportunities to the employees so they do not feel trapped and stagnant. Productivity and moral improves when employees feel they can develop and grow.

lastly, Corporate and Retail need to be on the same page with little to no conflict for goals, values, and protocol.

Numerous benefits, discounts of Apple products and other companies, free stuff every now and then, discounted and free shares, education and fitness reimbursement and more.
","The company as a whole is great, but my particular store is managed very poorly. No communication between leaders, store leader spends too much time in the office, doesn’t know how to connect with his staff, no room for advancement for the past 3 years because no one wants to change role, manager stand around talking rather than helping staff or customers, those bad behaviours are then reflected in staff, leaders then get annoyed when staff stand around talking but don’t see why it’s happening.

Again, this does not reflect on the entire company, other stores are run much better, please remember this.

Thank you for valuing your retail employees so much! Please revisit your training procedures for Tech Experts and Geniuses. We don’t all have to go to Austin or Cupertino, but there needs to be more oversite and standardization of how training is conducted now so people don’t fall through the cracks and get the time they need to train and practice.

Advice to Management
After leaving, I have a better perspective of what is wrong with Apple’s operations team. People don’t seem to matter at all especially if you work for the VP I worked for. He got promoted after berating people in public meetings and marching people to the ground. Unfortunately this says a lot about his management. My VP spat me out after I wasn’t useful to his career plans just like he did with his old crew when I started with him. I know the money is good but after the mental anxiety and stress that came with this toxic environment better to consider the trade offs. To those working for him, I pray for you everyday. His internal survey results speak for themselves.

Advice to Management
Please set realistic expectations and not give false hope to people about jobs. Please don’t say to people they will be in the pipeline if they are unsuccessful and one week before their contract ends tell them that’s not the case and they need to re apply after six months. It’s really disappointing and cruel to give someone that kind of hope. I was told my results were amazing and better than any temporary worker they have seen yet I was laid off and not even put in the pipeline. It’s really disappointing.

- Company culture
- Good stepping stone in an early career.
- Perfect for students .
","- Huge culture of nepotism. Management awards promotions based on favoritism, gender, sexual orientation and race in order to fill a political diversity agenda. Its a great initiative, but get ready to see someone getting high roles on a silver platter and see their career advance at the speed of light all while putting half the effort then someone else just because of the criteria listed.

- Absolutely no structure for advancement, management does pretty much what they want and if you dare complain you're on a black list permanently. They heavily bank on the ""ambiguity"" of the company structure to sweep their actions under the rug.

- Management is aware of those issues since they keep being the number one topic of complaints in employee surveys but they do nothing about it.

- They make you believe you're chosen and special, but you're very expendable.

- Bad worklife balance, unstable workshifts, working nights and weekends. Suitable for youngsters but avoid it if you have kids.

2019-12-12, Sales Specialist,"Miami Beach, FL","Former Employee, less than 1 year",Flexible Working Hours and Great Benefits.,"The benefits offered as an Apple employee, even as a part-time Sales Specialist are great. Health, vision, dental, employee discounts and more. Too many to count. Also, the flexibility of work hours for part-time employees is no doubt available. The support and training received are of quality.
","Movement from part-time sales specialist to full-time specialist is possible. However once you become full-time, your schedule is more or less is dictated by Apple. So the flexibility in working hours no longer becomes a priority.
Advice to Management
I would advise management to allow those who become full-time employees to have more flexibility in their work schedule. I also would advise to open up more part-time opportunities in other areas besides the Sales Specialist role. This would encourage many to take on opportunities to grow within the company and improve employee retention.

2019-12-10, Genius,,Current Employee,New Apple culture is all sales based,"Meet really cool people. Work with mostly very high caliber people. Great on a resume.
","Unless you want to get into management its a glass ceiling. As of 2019 the job role is converting into more of a sales-based role. Not concerned with technical troubleshooting anymore. Only about ""making new owners"" instead of fixing problems. Forced to evangelize about every Apple service/product no exceptions. Conversations have to be centered around new products and not about the customers current product. 

It's converting into Best Buy or *insert any other ""big-box""* chain store. 

The Lead Genius position no longer has anything to do with technical leadership or knowledge. Rather how to drive sales.
Advice to Management
Focus on cultivating technical strength. Soon there will be no one who works there who knows how to solve problems, but they sure will know how to sell a grandma the newest phone possible (that she probably doesn't need).

2019-12-03, Technical Specialist,"Houston, TX","Current Employee, more than 1 year",A Great Company... but still retail,"Apple has an amazing culture and is a really cool place to work at. The job comes with great pay, benefits, and career trajectory. You can wear anything to work as long as you have the Apple shirt on. Everybody is very open and liberal. Opportunities to advance in a retail role are open, but not for jumping into corporate.
","Retail, and especially Apple Retail, is exhausting. Apple Stores are busy nonstop. From the moment the doors open in the morning, customers are already waiting outside. The high demand requires management to schedule you very frequently, even as a part-time worker. It feels okay at first, but it drains you and then asking for time off takes at least 3 weeks to take effect for even a single day if it's available. Most of the time, these days requested off have to be requested at least 3 months in advance because other employees will request those days already. It is not flexible at all and working with management to take time off can be frustrating. There are frequent depressed employees that are just worn down from this nonstop environment, but do not leave because the benefits/pay is too good. On top of all of this, advancing from a retail position to a corporate position is impossible and is unheard of. If you're end goal is to work Apple Corporate and get ahead through retail, this is not the correct career path.
Advice to Management
Please make it easier to take time off, and hire more employees. Benefits are great, so I understand the expensive overhead. But employees are literally suffering at work.

Please hire/promote within. Hiring managers from Starbucks and Target is not the same. They're not privy to the work culture which then causes people to quit and find other opportunities. This is the reason why Apple has chosen to give ""Free"" (Tax- write-off) stock to its employees, however, you must stay a minimum of 3 years to receive the full stock.

2019-12-01, Sales Specialist,"Santa Rosa, CA","Former Employee, more than 5 years",Great Company Culture- Poor Management,"You will get great benefits, good vacation and sick time accrual. Other bonuses include discounts with multiple vendors, including your cell phone bill. Great company purchase plan if you are apple geek! No better prices. Hours are reasonable, but a challenge especially if you have other circumstances such as school, another job, family issues. Be prepared to deal with scheduling diffculties.

I learned a lot from this job in terms of sales tactics, peer to peer training, handling objections, the every changing world of technology and how apple continues to blow everyones mind!
","Promotes a great cultures- wraps it all up with a bow, but internally its retail. Its for profit and you arent viewed as a ""PERSON""- you are viewed as how much money can you make for apple? how much can you produce? How well liked are you by your peers and by your managers? Thats what takes the lead in whether or not you are promoted. If you are not liked in any way shape or form, do not expect to get promoted. As someone who chose to NOT get too personal with staff ( friendships outside of work), I am sure this played a part in not getting promoted for me.
Advice to Management
Practice what you preach and preach what you practice- let go of favortism and choose quality people vs. people who will short term perform to get what they want and tell managers what they want to hear. Do not get involved with staff personally- this location had a heavy reputation of managers getting involved with staff too easily and promoting those they were most close with. 
Apple management says they care, but continously failed to make efforts and create internal struggle with peers and themselves.

2019-11-30,,,Former Employee,Creative Pro - Greater Boston,"-Excellent benefits like stock plans, tuition reimbursement, discounts inside and outside Apple, health coverage for everyone (including part time). Also free health screenings and flu shot sessions once a year.

-Somewhat flexible with school schedules. 

-You make supportive and smart friends at Apple that last, who may move on to better corporate roles or other tech companies. Also great to hang out with, if work friends are your thing.

-Your career is centered around growth and development, being the best at your role. Even if you’re not staying long-term, you grow and learn a lot.

-Managers who started as non-management genuinely care about you. Market Leaders are generally visible and charismatic. They visit each store in their market at least once a week, sometimes twice.

-Occasional (once every two years or so) town hall with Apple executives, usually on topics of people, retail, diversity and inclusion. If Tim Cook is in town, he makes an effort to visit the nearest store. When he was in Boston for a speech at MIT, he stopped at Apple Boylston Street and took several employees to a Red Sox game where he briefly spoke.
","-Consistently seemingly too many, lofty, high stress targets every quarter that have to be met or even exceeded or else you won’t see any career progression at Apple. 

-Besides occasional flowery lip service from corporate and some retail managers, Today at Apple is not advocated for at all on any level - as a creative or creative pro Today at Apple are the sessions you facilitate. You will spend 85% of your time pitching Today at Apple to customers and/or selling accessories and services.

-Very little of your time is spent facilitating or preparing for sessions. And, because of this lack of advocacy, managers will always be questioning how you’re spending your time is common. They won’t trust you. It’s also common to be flexed from your duties to do *more important* things like sales. 

-You will frequently not have the proper equipment or working technology to facilitate seamless sessions. Due to the lack of advocacy, you will have Genius Bar and sales associates working with customers at your table or in the forum as you’re facilitating sessions. This will significantly negatively impact your ratings from customers.

-Your ratings and ultimately your compensation are directly influenced by the number of attendees you have in session, as well as their ratings of you. Anything but a 5/5 at Apple is considered bad. This rating system applies to all roles in Apple Retail.

-As of late (~5 years), Apple has been progressively hiring more and more big box managers from companies like Walmart, Best Buy, Target, and district managers from other random places like Gap, Starbucks, or Lord + Taylor. While they have volume experience necessary for Apple, they bring the same bad people habits and lack of creativity with them. These types of managers are colloquially referred to as the big box robots or “yes men”. Internally developed/promoted managers have always performed and led better, long-term.

-No long-term leave options for students like many other retail/service companies. Also, there’s absolutely no work/life balance. Tuition reimbursement criteria hard to achieve while working 32-45hrs/week.

2019-11-25, Customer Service Representative,,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",Worst Company I have worked for.,"Most people are friendly but in a very superficial manner.
","Where to start. You basically have to live and breathe it at every moment, on the clock or off. Forced overtime during releases or holidays. Passive aggressive management techniques designed to make you feel guilty for missing work. Revolving door of employees because of nearly unobtainable requirements set by management. Training had a lot of bumps in it, not because of the trainers, but the lack of material. I mentioned holidays before. You might as well forget seeing your family if you have to travel. No time off is allowed during the winter holidays. Zero, none, even if you have planned a year in advance. Overtime is often forced even during the weeks with holidays so you have even less time off for your families. When you express any concern over these practices the management takes you aside to remind you that only the customer is important and that you agreed to work any times the office was open. Speaking of time away from family, if you get assigned to a special project prepare to work 60+hours a week. Management becomes aggressive when you aren't performing to specific standards and this can sometimes lead to 20-25% turnover in a given month. In fact, less than 5% of my starting group lasted more than 90 days. Busy work is given almost daily, which interferes with work operations. Any new training is given via these ridiculous online courses or through a very brief summery in an online meeting (Webex). Worst of all, sometimes it is given out via email with little explanation of policy changes. Attendance is always an issue and with little wiggle room, no manner your tenure.

I guess the best summary is they put product and capitol far above their employees worth, like most businesses, but without a real pretense of caring. Low pay, long hours just to have Apple on your resume probably isn't worth it since most companies of the caliber pay more with better incentives. The work life balance is non existent with Apple.

Treat your employees with more respect, offer more incentives to work, and realize they are humans.

Paid biweekly, overtime available, have worked multiple 105 hour two week periods ($1100-1200 after tax and 10% to Employee stock plan and 6% to IRA contributions; I have another health plan so this is without any health benefits taken out). Full health benefits (You're still paying a chunk out of your paycheck but it is available).

You get $500 off iPad, iPhone, or Mac after 3 months working there or lower amount off a less costly item.
","GETS OLD QUICK. Job is not engaging. This is a workhorse position. You are not viewed as a person, your are viewed as statistic. I have 95% customer satisfaction over last 6 months, yet, if a customer is upset because they either locked themselves out of their device and have to wait or purchased a device off of Ebay and you have to explain to them that they got scammed, your manager will never take your side; they will always find a way to make the customer correct even if the customer is crazy. Managers constantly change so you never create a rapport before getting a new one that treats you as another number. There is no mobility between departments outside of AppleCare; I am a finance major and was hoping this would be a way to get my foot in the door of the finance department, however, there is only mobility in AppleCare. They would rather move you from T1 to T2 advisor than advise you to take a Financial Advising job at Morgan Stanley. 

If you keep your equipment, it's written off as a ""Benefit of Kind"" on their balance sheet so something to consider with the $4000 computer.

You are not paid off of performance, you are paid Cost of Labor for your position in your specific market. People in rich areas get paid more than people in poor areas even though they are doing the same job.

Apple tuition assistance only pays for courses related to your job as a T1 advisor so good luck using it on anything other than a tech field.

T2s are rude and most T1s are idiots.

They automatically assign you Full Time Shifts of 8 hours 5/7 days per week during Christmas and other holidays without asking you what works best for you whether it be hours or days.

Apple constantly changes protocols such as how ""How you should answer the phone"" and then ""Now you can't say this when you answer"" and it happens so often that when your calls get reviewed by a third party service, you will get failed on a call because a third party service knows the updated rules better than an employee. 

At the end of the day, the turnover is so high at this job that you are not valued as a person. The people whom are complacent and lazy enough to stay will be your managers; they reward complacency.
Advice to Management
Make job more engaging. Leave managers long enough to build rapport with advisors. Offer more mobility out of AppleCare and don't trap people who could do more with their life. Give incentives to employees other than the non-incentivizing employee enrichment emails. Trust your advisors and treat them as people, not numbers. Glad to be leaving soon.

—pay can be good depending on which product and org you work in.
—benefits are good. Health, dental, etc are top notch. Some people complain it doesn’t have free food 24/7 but apple does have free dinner
—travel benefits are excellent for people who travel a lot. I can’t communicate how good their travel is. The Apple Travel group are great people and help you no matter where you are on earth, 24/7 at a moments notice. Business class tickets for international, and your pick of hotels. 
—funding unlimited for products company is committed to shipping
—some fantastic colleagues. I’ve become friends with really great people because of the challenges you endure together
—the experience is unique: only Apple can do Apple
","—management. Good ones are hard to find, and even more difficult to transfer to. Often, job openings are due to people quitting a manager so people coming in don’t have a clue to what situation they’re stepping into.
—Highly political culture. Very siloed. GSM and Capex community is particularly difficult to work with. Some PD groups are legendary for being difficult to work with.
—turnover is high.
—People are highly educated, but sometimes don’t possess good engineering common sense. Endless funding and a faux accountability structure insulates people with amazing pedigrees but poor engineering judgement. 
—people are good at shifting blame, covering tracks, and overall bending the optics so that they look good regardless of outcome. More often than not, other cross functional groups and people are “thrown under the bus.”
—most positions are support. i.e. you’re most likely working on someone else’s vision or idea, whether you’re in product development or operations. 
—engineering is mostly execution based. You are most likely going to spend endless hours to prove out ideas based on ID’s whim and managers behest. This can be deeply frustrating for creative people.
—career advancement poor. You were hired to turn a crank and that crank you. shall. turn.
—it is a political place to work. Worth mentioning twice...

","Toxic management structure, manipulative leadership techniques and bullying is utilised to bring down your overall level of positivity. Each morning upon arriving to work, a small highlight of the prior day will often be over-exaggerated into a 30 minute 'download' which will be full of team-building, oddly-time clapping and celebrating. In turn, this will ensure you're hyped for the day ahead, only then for leaders to continue their power trip over your selling techniques. 
- In my time their, my direct leader who was involved in my hiring process told me the following: 'You're not Apple material', 'it's my way or the highway, that's why I get paid the big bucks', 'You need to be more personal and open up to your team-mates'. 

- Thec oncept of 'feedback' is an excuse to use your colleagues as a punching bag...sorry...'constructive' punching bag. 
- Autonomy doesn't exist, and god forbid that you're an independent thinker because you'll be shunned by leaders who feel threatened by your ideas or problem solving abilities. 
- Don't try and think for yourself, just accept it's an 'I say, you do' store and you will be fine
Advice to Management
Step up your game: independent thinkers, leaders, self-starters and passionate entrepreneurs are the employees that will turn into reliable workers at the end of the day. Don't be threatened when they treat you the same way that you treat them, acknowledge that you can be the one to shape the development of that individual.

Advice to Management
You need to bring back the original Apple culture that Steve cultivated. There is no more ""our soul is our people"", it's now all about numbers and oiling the squeaky wheel. Apple has become just another retail outfit and because of this the magic is gone.

There is poor work/life balance. Inconsistent schedules. Impossible to RTO unless it's 3 months in advance and maybe it'll get approved. You need to better train ""outside hired"" management in Apple culture and values. The Leadership team has always called it ""Leadership"" and not viewed management as a top down management practice...because to lead is to make a difference and have a positive impact...to manage is to delegate.

You hire a lot of college kids and then expect them to jump through hoops and re-work their college schedules...THEY CAN'T. And you cannot expect the same for employees with families that depend on them or those that are working multiple jobs because Apple underpays them or you just don't have ""the hours"". Give us all a break. You're a billion dollar company. For a company that claims to be great in dealing with ambiguity, you sure expect a lot of things to be very black and white. ""Leadership"" doesn't offer flexibility in scheduling because that would mean that you would have to put n the work to ensure that employee's needs - NOT WANTS- are met. No, it's not easy but it needs to be done. Where is your compassion and ""empathy""? Employees that are taken care of are PRODUCTIVE employees and clearly HAPPY.

Do better Apple. Steve would want you to.

","Each business group works in their own silo, you need to talk to each person to find out who is doing what, no official channel providing such information. 

All important decisions are made in headquarters (they call WW), and passed onto regional offices. 

Not transparent, line manager can block information in-between, and not sharing important informations to play power games. 

No opportunity to learn and grow, instead you need constantly contribute ideas to the company, this may only happen in certain business groups. 

Office bullying from senior manager or senior coworkers (eg. internal client), which needs a lot of kiss ups. 

Too many tools in each business group, either bought from 3rd part, or internal developed, tools get replaced too soon, waste a lot of money and manpower! Well, Apple has a lot of cash to waste, so I guess that's not a problem for them now. 

Office politics / interest groups, eg. the whole team of senior managers are ex-colleagues.

Employee feedback is not taken seriously, every year the employee survey is like show, no action is taken to address the issues after the survey, even they told you the survey is anonymous the result for each group is still shared within the groups - they narrow down the survey result to each business group, the manager just laugh about it, don't mention about employee feedbacks against the manager.

Manager use fake numbers to present to senior management or executive team, modify the actual number to make it look nice to get more fund.

","- Extremely outdated tools and technology. 
- Poor resource allocation.
- Extremely poor quality of internal tools.
- Constant reorganizations make it impossible to focus on a project.
- Recruiters don't care about you, they just want to fill their numbers.
Advice to Management
I was absolutely dumbfounded at the quality of the tools I was expected to use to do my job. For example, as a site reliability engineer, I care deeply about monitoring and alerting. The tools available to me were the worst that I've ever used, be it another fortune 500 company or small startup.

I find it absolutely insane that a company like Apple, that has all the resources in the world, doesn't enable their employees to do their best work by providing at least reasonable resources.

This category of tool is just one, but this problem extends to almost every area.

Not only were the tools I needed to do my job of poor quality, the techniques in use were outdated. More often than not, I would look into a system and find that it involves many undocumented parts, created by people no longer at the company, and not under configuration management. There was zero accountability to deliver quality work, and years if not decades of this has created a frail, mysterious and ugly infrastructure. It's difficult and unpleasant to work in.

In the slightly longer than a year timespan I spent here, I or my team was reorganized 5 times. This made it impossible to focus on medium to long term projects.

During my interview process the recruiter and interviewees assured me the position and work matched the many qualities I asked about, and that I would be able to work/do the areas I cared about. Once I moved into the position, I found out that it was all lies. This was extremely insulting. 

I consider my time here a complete waste in terms of professional growth. The only thing I gained is the name on my resume.

Every single day was pure torture.

Colleagues, Benefits, Culture <33","The people you will work with, management, and the dynamics of an apple store will change your life and the way you see customer service. You get two 15min breaks plus your lunch break. Great break room, great treats during launches, and they TRULY CARE ABOUT YOU AS A HUMAN!
","You'll be on your feet all day, if it's slow and you're not someone who likes to stay active, you might have a hard time wanting to wipe phones and fold chords. 

Interactions with customers can last for hours! It's not really a con, it's the nature of the job. You think buying, activating, and setting up an iPhone takes 10mins? rethink that.

I love my opportunity for advancement and have a lot of different avenues I can take within the company.
","Work/life balance is pretty bad. They do offer different schedule choices but I always have to either work weekends or a super late shift and I don’t get to spend time with my family. Every time my new schedule releases, I always refresh my resume thinking I’m going to find another place to work that has more reliable schedule but I can’t ever beat the pay that Apple offers so I’m just forever stuck with a terrible schedule that changes every 4 months. If Apple could figure out how to make the scheduling better for At-Home advisors, it would literally be the perfect place to work.

2019-10-28,Anonymous,Melbourne,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",Good work arrangement unless you are Ambitious and looking for career growth (AHA - Australia),"Work from home, so good for people who need to take care of kids or don't want to travel to work.
Supportive staff, 25% discount on apple products.
Great experience working with some of the best practices in Customer support.
-Good for people who are students, parents who have to take care of kids, oldies who don't have any mortgage to pay or have a secondary source of income.
","- Probably the lowest salary in IT Support in Australia when you compare the average salary across the industry. Its even lower than non-IT roles of call centers in many cases.
- Highly monotonous role. I was lucky to have a great manager who used to trust the team in doing the right thing and had our backs. Some of my colleagues resigned as their team manager would micro manage their breaks and ask them to keep updating their chat status so they know when they are away.
Basically inconsistent behaviour and inconsistent team management strategy across managers. 
- Most of the time manager feedback/complaint will never work and you will be asked to change your team.
- One of the Manager of managers from Perth will always say that you lucky to work from home however they don't realize that everyone knows that by not having a support office of Apple in Australia, Apple is saving cost and it is in their interest to not have office and not in employee's interest for them to work from home.
- Most managers will talk about growth stories where someone got promoted in 6 months or 1 year, however what they don't say is that there was a need for these positions and Apple was growing in Australia at high rate hence they choose the best amongst the lot, just lucky to be at the right place at the right time.
- Most people who joined in early 2011-2012 are all at managerial position, however now it is really really tough to be at that level. Even manager salaries are not that good. (approx 65-70k) 
If you are ambitious and want a career growth, then your chances of success are less than 1% as most of Apple's AUS operations are managed from Singapore and if there is an opportunity to grow, there are already more than 200 AHA advisors ahead of you with 2--3 years of experience.
- you will get trained on iOS, then MacOS, then level 2 however with more responsibility your pay will hardly grow by 80/100 AUD per month.
It is good if you don't have a job and need to pay bills, get in AHA however move on to a better career which pays more.
- Lastly based on your team ranking you will get shifts for next 2 months, and whether you like it or not, you will have to work atleast 1 weekend shift which can sometimes be frustrating if you live you your family as you won't get time with them on weekends.

Overall their pay is very low and no growth opportunities, and if you are ok with it and don't want a career growth, then this is the right place for you.
Advice to Management
Only reason I left was the pay structure at Apple, however even the management knows that they can easily get people at cheaper rates due to their brand name, hence supply-demand economics come in play, so guess Apple is doing the right thing for their business.

Pros you always hear about are above average salaries and benefits. This is true. Another pro is being able to cut your teeth in customer interaction roles. Generally people are big fans of the Apple brand.
","It seems since Steve Jobs left, Apple has stopped innovating. Almost everyone has an iphone at this point so making sales is harder. They have relied on old retail tactics of upselling insurance and credit cards and upgrade programs as much as possible. That is essentially the only thing they talk about at meetings. When I took the job i expected a real focus on customer service, which is what they talked about in onboarding, when really the purpose of the store is to get customers to buy insurance and other monthly recurring revenue products. Also, the reality of transferring from retail to corporate is not nearly as likely as you might think. In fact, unless you want to take a retail job in corporate, it would be wiser to work specifically in the area you want for several years then apply to Apple for it.

Advice to retail management. While I understand you are all under pressure to hit the numbers regarding insurance sales, take more time to connect one on one with workers to get to know them. I heard this is what they used to do in the past, but unfortunately don’t do anymore.

2019-10-24, Specialist,,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",Won't pay tuition reimbursement they promised.,"Honestly, a lot of pros, but at the end of the day, I'm screwed out of over 3 grand because of a simple mistake.
","GP Strategies handles tuition reimbursement. One of the main reasons I have my job at Apple is because it is part time while I study full time. I hit the wrong button and my classes were not submitted within 30 days of them beginning (they were only 'saved') and now they're refusing to make an exception which means the $3500 I spent on classes will not be covered like outlined in the benefits package.
Advice to Management
Don't screw over your employees over small things. Don't look for a reason not to pay them the benefits you flaunt.

","This is a call taking role and calls are relentless over the 7.5 hours so it can wear you down in the long run. No clear path for career growth out of the call taking role. Pay is at industry standard but as the role is considered a customer service role, the pay is too low to sustain your living over the long term.

They offer fitness reimbursement up to 300 for full time employees, 150 for part time. The give 5,200 for tuition reimbursement. The health, dental and vision care is amazing. Also a 100 stipend to take the train or use for uber pools. You are also surrounded by creatives all day, people from all walks of life that you can network with. Repairing is challenging but with the right time member its a fun work environment .
","On going training needs to be mandatory. there's so many products always releasing but not enough alignment or hands on training to truly understand how to troubleshoot and resolve issue.

Dealing with ambiguity is sometime overwhelming. There is so much of it and management is no help. Depending on who your managers are will determine how long you stay on the job.

work life balance is a joke unless you are part time.

2019-10-13, Software Engineer,"Cupertino, CA","Current Employee, less than 1 year",A great place for Software Engineers,"People treat each other with respect. Software Engineers are highly valued here. Work life balance is great. The schedule is flexible and no one expects you to be at work during certain hours, unless you have scheduled meetings. The most important thing is to be a good team player and to get the work done in an efficient way. 

There are a lot of growth opportunities for smart people and it’s easy to get promoted if you do a great job. There is no competition between peers. Officially everyone is a software engineer, only your manager knows your level. 

Apple provides you with powerful hardware to get the job done. People are officially allowed to use eligible company devices for personal stuff.

Food at cafes is great and very well prepared. There are a lot of company events, concerts with celebrities coming to Apple and other fun stuff.

Discounts and benefits are incredible. You get a lot of perks. There are several on-site clinics with literally zero wait times. You show up for your appointment, they greet you, take you to your doctor right away.

2019-10-12, Technical Support,"Midway, GA","Former Employee, more than 3 years",Cancerous management,"Benefits. Good pay. That's about it.
","Management doesn't care about you at all. They love talking over you and talking you like a child. The whole environment is cancerous honestly. They pride themselves on culture but I never saw it, and managers were never friendly or empathic with me on my personal needs or my medical needs. I told them before my firing that this would really be rock bottom for me and that is kill myself. When they fired me in a webcam session I honestly considered it, and with 2 managers on camera pulled my gun out cocked it and put it to my head on camera. They didn't respond or do anything before I told them I need to leave and shut down my computer. I dare anyone at Apple to pull that session since I know it's recorded, but that's who you're dealing with

You'll be screwed time and again on your schedule so just get used to that. 4 years I was there, never once did I get the schedule I wanted or anything close to it. And you'll be severally chastised for asking questions about it, the last time I did I was mysteriously fired 2 days later. The times for that by the way are 1pm-2am EST. So if you can't work those hours don't bother applying because these people simply don't care. 

No matter what you are the customers punching bag, no it's ands or buts. This company will never have your back. 

Moving up is impossible because for one there's been a hiring freeze since 2016 and two you'll have a million managers in your time each resetting your progress, asking you the same questions as the last until you're ground pulp and give up.

2019-10-12, Senior Program Manager,"Sunnyvale, CA","Current Employee, more than 5 years",Apple will not incentivize and doesn't implement over site nor a process when. awarding annual bonuses.,"Job security, will not fire especially if you are paid 50% less than other people doing the same work.
","Biased: gender, ethnic, disability, age, etc
Human Relations (HR) and Employee Relations (ER) supports all unethical and illegal activity done by management
Management refuses to incentivize or promote certain types of people regardless of how often a person follows up and/or asks how to be incentivized or promoted.
When an employee submits a complaint to HR or ER regarding equal pay issues, HR, ER, and management artificially degrades the complainers performance and sets them up for perpetual failure but doesn't put employee on PIP.
Apple administration will not do anything to stop bias and unequal pay unless a lawsuit and/or EEOC complaint is filed. They are willing to take their chances that they will not get sued or caught. Would rather spend man power on justifying why the company allows bias and unequal pay instead of making sure that all deserving employees are incentivized. 
HR and ER admits that the lack of bonuses for under represented minorities and due to bias is approved by all management including the CIO, Mary Denby.
Advice to Management
Management should stop breaking employment law and HR and ER should stop enabling them. I was passed up six years in a row for a cash and RSU bonus and was told every time that although my performance met the high expectations of my role that my manager has ""sole discretion"" to incentivize whomever he or she wants and Apple does not implement guidelines on who should receive bonuses. Human Relations and Employee Relations openly admitted to allowing unequal pay for equal work and said that there is ""nothing they can do about it.""

2019-10-03, Apple AHA,"Killeen, TX","Current Employee, more than 5 years",Good work from home opportunity,"Get to work from home and are provided with all the equipment you need to do the job. 6% 401k matching. Paid vacation time. Employee stock purchase plan.
","Unless you manage to move up to higher paying positions every few years then it's likely you will be making less over time adjusted for inflation since your merit increases won't keep up with annual inflation. There is an internal discussion regarding this that has been going on for quite some time but has failed to gain any real traction.

Also if you are a chat advisor then your multitasking capabilities need to be excellent since you will be chatting with usually 2 and occasionally up to 3 people simultaneously about different technical issues you will need to diagnose, troubleshoot, and provide a resolution for and you will be evaluated primarily by customer survey feedback. Time is tracked to the second as well which includes your average handle time for each case, time spent finishing logging cases after the chat ends, your breaks, lunches, and punches in and out and if you deviate by more than a few minutes on come of the more important metrics then you'll likely hear from your manager about it.
Advice to Management
Advocate for the employees to voice their concerns about cost of living adjustments and getting increased pay when the pay scale for the area they are in increases and they don't see any increase since they are already working there.

That is not the case at Apple. The customer experience is the most important focus on every call. As long as you are having great conversations you will not be pressured to get off of a call.
","Just like any call center there is a focus on minimizing time between calls and making sure you are available to take calls. This can create some stress but just make sure to keep the average acw time within the expectations set by leadership. 

Apple expects greatness from their employees. I would like to see them paying their specialists great wages instead of just the ""industry average"". If they expect ""greatness"" they should pay accordingly for that level of ""greatness"" at work.

2019-09-24, French Chat Advisor,Cork,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",Major disappointment,"You work in what they call the best customer service in the world. Beautiful offices in Cork and working material.
","If you are not particularly fan of the products and you had a good experience in customer service before. It is tough !! I was chat advisor ! I did not know anything about the products so the training was crazy difficult ! The level of perfection they do expect in each chat is unbelievable. We used to call each day the ""washing machine"" with 2-3 chats at the same time all day long. Pressure is huge with the stats. Was not lucky with my manager who was not pleasant at all. A little bullying from time to time, shouting on you when you are not fast enough to start your meeting, no thank you for the job done, never enough, never happy. After my experience at Xerox it was like a big slap in the face. Was too afraid to lose my job to say anything. I believe she was not well trained nor supervised.
Advice to Management
My experience has been a huge disappointment. I entered Apple proud to be hired and with a great admiration for Steve Jobs path and innovation in general. Without to be used to the product at all, I thought the products were beautiful.
I gave my best even if I was not the fastest or the more knowledgeable but I have been litterally crushed by my manager. She was completely focused on her results for promotion and did not really care about the consequences of her behaviour. I was exhausted at the time so maybe I did not well managed the situation but please, monitor your managers and teach more about the importance of the human being in the workplace.

","-Management is not great. If they like you, you will get great reviews and they will tell everyone about how amazing your doing. It changes very quickly though when you get your first negative or neutral review from a customer they will completely turn on you. Like they don't care anymore. It's really sad to see that happen. Usually no matter how good you do favouritism is a big part of it.
-Holiday hours are impossible to take. There is never any hours available.
-Management lies, they could discuss something with you and then send of a report to the area manager saying something completely different.
-You get 7 seconds between calls.
-No matter how much you try you are never good enough.

- Benefits are good
- Coworkers are pretty cool
- You can kinda pick your schedule
- Scheduled downtime during shifts
","- Micromanagement is rampant in the AppleCare department. Managers do not perform the same job. Their job is to make sure you’re doing your job. That’s it. They don’t understand everything about your role, they’re strictly there to keep eyes on you 24/7. 
- Essentially no room for growth. This is a dead end job. They’ll train you and teach you more skills, but your pay will be exactly the same. 
- You have absolutely no voice. Nothing gets by managers. If you have a problem, don’t expect anyone to do anything about it.
- If you’re a college advisor, you’ll never have a weekend off. I haven’t had a weekend off for 76+ weeks. You can take time off, but you rarely get enough time off to take a weekend off, and a vacation. Use it wisely. 
- Get ready to work. You’re treated like an unskilled factory worker & there is almost no room for error. 
- They don’t focus on strengths. Solely weaknesses. They’ll always find something to nitpick. You’re never “doing good.” Every performance review has a fail on it somewhere.

","They do NOT need competent people in the company, just people available to do and say everything the managers want.
I’ve done 4 month of trial with other 10 collegues in an Italian Apple store. 
I came from an IT company and I have a degree in computer science, so I knew everything about mac OSX and every other operating system.
I am able to tell people all they need to know about Apple devices, from technical Specs to what they can do with their devices.
I am able to solve problems and give advices to anyone about what they need to buy. I am also a logic pro X, iMovie and Final Cut advanced user and that was a problem...
I was able to cover every role, so my collegues saw me as a threat, so they told manager bad and false things about me and managers belived them! So at the end of the trial I was the ONLY ONE who got kicked out.
They gave excellent contracts to people who:
- Din’t speak English
- Didn’t know anything about softwares or technology
- FORGOT TO GO TO WORK (one of my coworkers forgot his workshift twice, but hey, let’s give him a contract)
-Didn’t respect company policies
All of this under the eyes of very bad managers!
The point is... do not trust your coworkers, because they’ll do anything to take you down, and the ONLY way to get a decent contract and carreer is to become friend of one of the manager and turn your “enemies” agains them.

","Customers are sometimes very needy and you are on a time window, in order to help more. Pressure builds up on busy days and sometimes you have to juggle around multiple customers at once. Once you get good at it its great but it will take a while to get the hang of it. If you put in work and help others and pay attention to how performance is measured you'll do great.

If you want to work from home and you don't care how management treats you, this is the place for you. If you are looking for a career or movement in your position this isn't for you. They have managers who tell you to do something against COMPANY POLICY! Managers who constantly call out and DO NOT care about there teams. If you happen to miss a couple days because your sick and you have to call out, better believe you will be on an attendance warning when you get back. This isn't your average company to work for. They love to give you more work, then what you agreed to without a pay increase. They expect your a AHA to do a managers job by creating presentations, reviews, ideas to improve your dept and COMPANY, and then you get ZERO recognition for it. If you like to be walked over, sign up. But if you take pride in what you do and you have done nothing but stride and give over 150% to this company expect the least. Managers are like revolving doors. Management won't give a rats a about you. Oh and if you go over in your breaks by a few seconds, you will be talked to, if your to early and clock in, they will talk to you. They may be a TRILLION dollar company, but they sure act like a company barely holding on to there funds.. I wouldn't recommend working here. I could write a novel about this company on how UNETHICAL they are. It is all fun and games back when someone else was over your company, then serious changes happen, and do I mean SERIOUS. This company use to be something every person could imagine to work for, now its a neglected, overrated, powerhouse who doesn't have about the true employees who carry the company. DO NOT WORK FOR THEM!

- work from home is a great option that promotes a pretty good experience of trying to build community

","- the metrics they measure you on can be unreasonable because if some random person you helped does not apple policy and takes it out on you in a review, you are expected to some how have known how to fix their attitude. 

- expectations of time between calls is pretty bad. Some of these calls can be really taxing just because of a bad attitude or lack of knowledge from the person you are helping. Now let's say you have about 5 of these in a row. Sometimes you just want way longer than 2 minutes to answer the next call.

","It doesn't matter how efficient you are--if you work for AppleCare (or other departments, probably), you will be unofficially on-call literally 24/7/365 for constant fire drills (fake emergencies). If you don't answer a phone call at 2 a.m. during a supposedly slow period or bring your computer with you on vacation, you could lose your job.

Upper-level managers have zero tech background and no clue what anyone below them does. You'll get further by smiling than by working hard. So many people are burned out that fully half of the people on our 80-person team are applying for jobs outside of Apple, yet there are never any repercussions for management when anyone manages to escape.

Super racist environment, too. Most Latinx employees work as custodians or in the kitchen, and Black employees are nearly nonexistent.

People keep mentioning health benefits as perks, but what good are benefits and time off if you're not allowed to use any of them?
Advice to Management
Get over yourselves--get rid of the hierarchical BS. Stop telling employees we're lucky to work 80-hour weeks, then refusing to let us step away for an hour to use our dental insurance. Just because this is Apple, shouldn't mean you shouldn't face repercussions for illegal behavior.

","Apple treats its employees as easily replaceable commodities. Don’t expect any loyalty from the company even after working there for over a decade. In fact, they’d rather treat new employees better and the seasoned employees, because new employees are usually still drinking the Apple Kook-aid and are still optimistic about the future. 
Don’t trust HR. Employees don’t realize that HR has a legal obligation to Apple and it’s stakeholders to protect the company and side with the company on employee issues. They are NOT looking out of the employee’s best interest. That is not their job, but they would like you to think they are. Do not confide any confidential information with. They will turn on you and defend Apple rather than admit wrong doing by the company and risk a lawsuit from an employee. I’ve seen many employees forced out of the company because HR turned on them and they became a liability. 
Apple makes it nearly impossible to advance in your career and get a decent raise. To make matters worse, if you’ve been at the company for a long time, newer, less experience employees will probably be making more money than you, because Apple doesn’t value employee retention.

2019-08-29, Technician,Melbourne,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",Appreciation is so important at Apple & that's great.,"- The best think about working at apple is the fact that they make you feel appreciated. No matter how small your inputs are or how large your contribution is, you are made to feel important and special. No other workplace does what Apple does. 
- You cannot have a better retail job than at Apple. Pay, opportunities, general work enjoyment are all great. 
- Looks good on your resume, especially when applying for corporate roles elsewhere(post graduation).
- Most of the team that you work with have similar personalities to you so it's easy to make new friends.
","- Some of the team are a little weird.
- Management sometimes doesn't back up your decisions. 
- Part timers lose their weekends. 9-5 weekends makes you hate life a little.
Advice to Management
Roster half days here and there on weekends. Sometimes we want to enjoy life a little with our families and friends.
Keep doing what you're doing in terms of showing gratitude and appreciation. For someone that doesn't have much positivity outside of work it's really humbling to have a whole team of people patting you on the back for doing something right.

Working from home
","When working from home it’s an extremely micromanaged environment - 8 minutes a day for bathroom breaks! 
Also if you’re an at home advisor the chances for any kind of progression are minuscule once you reach senior advisor
Salary isn’t great for senior advisor
The biggest con is the hours. There is no flexibility whatsoever. 
If you get a crap shift then you’re stuck with it for months. And working all over Christmas is just miserable!
Advice to Management
Trust the employees - less micromanagement 
Offer part time or job sharing especially for people returning from maternity leave and that way you might hold on to more tenured advisors.

","Extremely difficult to make upward advancement despite the company adamantly encouraging you to make effort to do so. Lots of “lateral” moves to different positions which, despite requiring an entire new interview and hiring process (even from within), do not result in much benefit (monetary or otherwise). There is a huge amount of turnover so they almost expect you to leave once you realize there’s almost nowhere to go but sideways. Annual “merit increases” of 2-5% are the most you can hope for if you do not apply, interview and get hired into an “elevated” position which some stores do not even allow. Don’t get hired at the bottom!

More honesty and transparency with regards to setting realistic expectations for employees. Stop “dangling the carrot.”

","Apple Education has lost its way. Google and Microsoft have positioned the value in the cloud and associated education apps /solutions / Chromebooks for the classroom at a fair price point. Apple, on the other hand, is still relying on selling just expensive but beautiful hardware. They do discuss and associate some specialized Apple solutions/tools to STEM but actually, have no real connection/knowledge or integration into district curriculum. They also do not offer a specialized Edu Cloud solution!
Advice to Management
Look at what leaders/teachers/students really want in their learning. Also, check out the competition! Then, ditch the arrogance, develop a strategic plan that is based on actual customer needs and competitive threats which does not solely rely on expensive hardware.

Advice to Management
Communication between management seemed abit conflicted at times. One day I’d be told not to worry about my pace and focus on the quality of my service, the next day I’d be told by another manager I need to speed up.

I was also told that I couldn’t help customers set up their devices if they had been swapped out - even if they asked for the help. Ridiculous if you’re employed to turn detractors into promotors.

Pace was apparently my main flaw at Apple because I took extra time and care with customers whom had bad experiences with their product. When this process was rushed, the customer feedback was terrible. 

When you’re employed to establish a solid form of customer service in any job, pace isn’t the most important value in this role, it is the quality of the service that you provide to the customer depending on the situation. That is something you can’t put a time limit on.

Advice to Management
If you are believe in Your values, act like it. I was in a situation where The values were ‘everyone is welcome, everyone is included, feedback and honesty is important’. During a multi-month push on gender and gendered language inclusion training, I mentioned that I don’t feel welcome because I have a military background and I address people as ‘sir or ma’am’. In a private conversation with the store manager, I was threatened, “learn to be more inclusive or we won’t feel comfortable giving you that promotion we have been working on.” 

I was also lied to when the store manager told me that I had failed to adapt to requests of individuals to address them in a certain way. Distressed and not liking the feedback, I followed up with the individuals mentioned and they confirmed that I had been improving, and while it was slow at first, there weren’t any issues currently. So, either the store manager lied, or all three of my coworkers lied. 

Either way, Apple has proven to be a typical corporate entity. They talk one way because they are required to, but fail to live up to their policies or at least they use their own definition of commonly understood words for things like ‘inclusion’. 

Further more, advancement is only an option if you buy whole sale into extreme left wing identity politics ideology. If any hint ever emerges that you aren’t in full, complete, and utter compliance, there will be no advancement. You might be able to drone away in your current role for ever, but you will always be an outsider. Ironically, ‘in groups and out groups’ was something that I was told must be avoided at all costs. Yet the extremism with which they require compliance creates out groups be default given how far it goes.

Benefits are great
Opportunities to promote are available

Its not about the customer as they say it is. you have to shove all services and things available for customers; within a 15 min time, and then have to worry about getting a good survey.
Corporate Apple is completely disconnected with the retail side. They have no idea what's going on within store level and make policies for the retail side. Most upper management has never worked in a retail role

Micromanaged for everything you do. 
Angry and rude customers non stop

Scheduling is random, no available set schedule.

","Apple will heap on additional job responsibilities with no additional pay and no warning. You have no say in it at all. My job description certainly did not include having to take international calls. I was told I would support US and Canada only. Customers will yell at you, belittle you and insult you every day and you are expected to just eat it. Upper management and corporate does not care. This is a billion dollar company who penny pinches with the lower levels of the company (couch cough Applecare). They used to make you feel important, like sending small appreciation gifts. Now, they only do this for retail. They make it clear you are lower than dirt if you are tech support. It's impossible to leave tech support. Once you are there, you are stuck there. And it's a miserable, unappreciated depressing job. I have been out on medical leave and so have hundreds of others caused by the stress of this job. You will be micromanaged to within an inch of your life. You can do everything perfect, resolve issues and make the customers love you and it will never, ever be good enough. You will be lied to consistently. You will be ignored, criticized and your self-esteem will take more hits than a stoner at 420. By the time you leave this job, you will be a shell of your former self.

","Unless you have a private understanding with your manager before you join, you will likely not be promoted to higher levels. Career development is reserved only for the chosen few and not made explicit. Opportunities to grow by changing teams is much more limited that at most large companies, because the managers see movement as disloyalty rather than a natural outcome of having no clear career development promotion path.
Advice to Management
I understand and appreciate the reason for low ratio of Directors to reports in Apple, but the lack of explicit career development and other options through mobility within Apple then have a tendency to create the appearance of favoritism, which can be very toxic to team morale.

2019-08-01, Corporate Recruiter,"Sunnyvale, CA",Former Employee,"Strong pay and world class coworkers, terrible work life balance and transparency","Well above market compensation. Many companies say that they have world-class talent, but from my experience staffing many of the largest tech companies in Silicon Valley, they have some of the sharpest people I've ever met. Incredible buildings and amenities. Ability to learn from incredibly bright coworkers.
","Terrible individualistic culture with everyone only looking out for themselves. No work/life balance (I worked about 70 hours a week to meet the near-impossible expectations with no recognition of hard work). Complete lack of transparency. Culture of fear with no feedback. Everyone was terrified every time our Director walked in the room, she was a boss, not a leader. It's the wild west, everyone only looks after themselves and there is no structure whatsoever to give you any guidance. The benefits are surprisingly bad for such a large and prestigious company. Still have to pay for all food/lunches with no snacks in the cafes (I know we are privileged here in the Valley but all of their peers have everything free). AT THE END OF THE DAY, you will learn a ton, get paid a ton and work on some really cool stuff. BUT, this will come at the expense of poor work-life balance, a fear/hierarchical/selfish culture.
Advice to Management
I know secrecy is a pillar of the culture but the extent the company takes it makes the employees feel isolated and like their work doesn't matter. This is truly a place where you feel like a drop in a bucket. If you don't blindly follow what they are doing, they encourage you to leave.

-no pressure sales
-ongoing trainings
-high level expectations that challenge you
-recognition
-constructive development
","You are working retail, after all. Things that go along with that include:
-upset customers
-lazy/entitled coworkers
-retail hours (a LOT of weekends and holidays)
-dealing with ambiguity

Also, you have to REALLY stand out to move up. With massive numbers of staff looking for similar positions (it’s not a job people in elevated roles leave very often), growth becomes very much about performance/influence and can become competitive.
Advice to Management
Non performing employees place as much, if not more of a burden, on other employees than they do on management. It IS your job to coach and instruct those employees to be a better asset to the team and it shouldn’t be looked over. In my near decade in Apple Retail, leaders tend to look away when they like an employee or no longer want to deal with them, but that gives the impression of favoritism or poor leadership and makes great employees bitter. I’ve lost too many fantastic coworkers for this exact reason alone. Please don’t let it keep happening.

Level playing field for all employees, and allow the formation of groups from all perspectives. You demand long hours, so tolerance for all is necessary for everyone to be able to express their opinions, not just those who lean left. OR, don't allow any groups to bring their political views and values to the place of business. Your choice, but it needs to be fair for all.

You learn the basics of software and hardware triage and I've seen many go on and do great things outside of Apple.
","Most folks feel they are underpaid and the kind of work you're doing can often be monotonous. It's not for everyone, and for whatever reason managers tend to treat staff like kids who need to be babysat and are incapable of making good decisions without their hand being held, aka lots of micromanaging goes on. Lot's of turnover has become a theme the past couple years.
Advice to Management
Treat your staff with more respect and pay them better. They deserve so much more than what you're giving them. You will continue to lose talented people if you don't drastically alter what it means to work for Apple. It used to mean something it doesn't as much anymore.

","Discount and benefits are awful for what you have to deal with from the entitled and rude customers on a daily basis, but of course they make it out like they give you an arm or a leg. 

If you are creative in anyway e.g. musician, apple own 50% of your creativity as ""they have supplied the tools to assist you"". It's written in your contract. Same if you own a businesses too. 

We are followed around the shop floor by management and leads (which is a less useful manager with no real power) holding iPads with the shop schedule on it. You have to request permission to use the bathroom or even to go for a glass of water. You will be scheduled to a table/bay and if you move an inch they will passive aggressively ask you if you are where you are suppose to be. It's like a nursery with paycheques.

If you are late more than 2 times in 3 months they will discipline you.

If you are an Apple fanboy and you're willing to be their loyal subject then you will do well there. If you're a normal human and have other life ambitions e.g. working in the creative industry I'd avoid it! They make it obvious to you that you are in a desirable retail position and if you can't abide by their strict rules then you aren't worthy of being an apple employee.

","There isn't really any cons since I knew what I was signing up to and understand the challenges of the role. After years of being there you will start to notice the position range will get smaller as At Home roles can only get you so far up until your at a road block but there is still time for Apple to slowly role out new positions available for AHA as they grow and extend their business which may open more windows in another area.

Employee stock purchase plan for full and part time, 401k matching, and the like.

","Salary is awful, very strict metrics, micromanagement (Somebody is always listening and watching what you do). Constant phone calls with very few breaks in between. I was doing 50-60 calls per day. Customers are very rude and having to listen to that 8-10 hours a day is mind-numbing and pushes you to the edge. Very difficult to get time off unless you book well in advance. Your shift lasts for three months and if you get a shift you don't like such as 11:30-8:30 good luck finding somebody to swap with and of course. There is also weekend work involved so your work/life balance is very poor. It's a call center job just like every other one. The only positive I can say I got out of it was Apple on my CV, I walked into other jobs as soon as they saw that.

In my case I had then 4 more interviews with some of the management where they just talked with you to get to know not only if you were a good fit for the company but also if the company is a good fit for you. They'll ask you why you want Apple, why you want certain positions, and what value can you bring since they are looking for new and different perspectives than what they currently hold. It's very laid back and if you prepare well, you should be perfectly fine.

","Difficult hours, after all it is still retails. Inconsistent schedule, very difficult to develop a long term routine. Sometimes scheduled 6 days straight. 

Customer support roles can be difficult, employees and measured on many metrics and expected to multitask new customers every 15 minutes.

2019-07-15, Retail Sales Manager,,"Former Employee, more than 5 years","Great culture, product & teams!","Products sell - sounds simplistic but for anyone who has worked in an environment where sales forecasts are unrealistic and the product development is static this makes for a challenging sales management environment. Fortunately, this is not the case at Apple. Goals are ambitious but achievable thanks to product quality, focus on user privacy and support/troubleshoots available to resolve occasional system downtimes.

Great culture and benefits - benefits outside of your salary are great! People hired aren’t just intelligent but also personable!
","Work/ Life balance - retail stores follow standard retail shift work so no guarantee of weekends off and public holidays. Although you can make requests which are usually supported unless it’s a busy period.

Monotony - the work can seem at times monotonous and not intellectually stimulating. Apple make their own softwares and tweak processes throughout the year based on customer and employee feedback but not drastically so sometimes it can feel like groundhog day.

2019-07-12, Applecare Advisor,Singapore,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Good Welfare, Terrible Politic","Interview and on-boarding processes were amazing. Generally friendly and helpful co-workers. Employee’s welfare was generous, such as health benefits, wellness center, gym, staff purchase, health checkups and stocks. Company was active in participating in volunteering events. There were also a lot of internal events which employees could join freely. Good culture.
","Unclear career progression. There were some questionable promotions happening among the teams. Team managers were biased towards certain employees, and the situation got rather unfair and obvious when it came to promotion and pay increment. It happened across the hierarchy and it seemed that nobody could do anything about it. 

Working schedule was too rigid and sometimes unreasonable, up to a point whereby everyone was utilising the 14-day medical leaves as annual leaves.

No real bonuses was given. They would distribute the so-called “bonus” in a form of company stocks instead, which is rather deceiving.

2019-07-04, Specialist,,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",Great in theory but could be better in reality,"Benefits are amazing. Seriously. That’s why it’s hard to leave.
","On the floor you are on non-stop. It is pretty stressful going from one customer to the next. Apple preaches that the retail experience is all about improving lives. But, it’s felt more about selling phones, AppleCare, and getting people signed up for the iPhone upgrade plan. Truthfully, anyone could do the job I was doing with the right training, and I was wasting talents at a company I’d never grow in.

I’m sure a corporate job would be different, but I’d never work for Apple retail again.
Advice to Management
Let people pursue the area they want. I wanted to work in inventory; they wanted me to be a technician or expert. In two years, the conversation never pointed toward me moving to an inventory role. I never felt heard or taken seriously for my own strengths and goals.

Recommend
CEO Approval
Business Outlook
Pros
Benefits are top notch for a company of this size
Cons
- No work life balance
- Company culture is NOT what you think it is
- They don't care about your performance or tenure, if you don't have the ""look"" of being an employee or getting promoted, prepare to be stuck in the same role for years with no real raises that barely reflect COLA.
Advice to Management
Stop with the political nonsense. You can file legitimate Sexual harassment complaints to HR, and nothing is done about it. They leave it to other Market Leaders who have their managers backs. It's all a buddy system/club, and if you're not in the game, you'll never advance at this company. Retail has killed the culture apple cultivated.

2019-06-23, College IOS Advisor,"Atlanta, GA","Former Employee, more than 1 year","If you have a great manager, this can be a good experience.","Great benefits. Partial flexibility as a student. Free points toward gift cards. Ability to work from home. Being a part of a team. Temporarily a free mac. Discounts on Apple products.
","Difficult customers. If you have a sarcastic or micromanaging manager, you won't last long. As I was getting close to my second year, my experience became awful, as I had a difficult manager. You will most likely have to work through Christmas and New Years.
Advice to Management
When students ask for a new manager, give them one. I started out with a great manager, but then was assigned a manager whose personality did not match with my own, and many other students.

","Pay just above minimum wage, bare minimum of holidays that you have to go through a lot of bureaucracy to get approved. Making it as difficult as possible to give feedback but when you do state ""thanks for your feedback"" and do nothing about it. You will only get promoted and/or recognised if management likes you. If not, you could invent the next iPhone and you'll never get anywhere. Often dirty and smelly facilities. A lack of innovation and a tendency to do things over and over again without implementing feedback that has been given by hundreds of people for years. Poorly trained advisors due to high fluctuation trying to be ""supervisors"" leading to nobody really knowing what they are doing.
Advice to Management
Take feedback seriously and implement it. Pay employees better/treat them better. Clean the toilets more frequently. Have a free shuttle and canteen. Train your employees better.

Advice to Management
Part time employees have not chosen to dedicate their entire life or a majority of their time to Apple, or any retail entity. It's nice to have the benefits that are also extended to full-time employees, but being able to work a truly part-time schedule is important. Those with passions that take place outside the store should be allowed to take precedence. This requires a higher headcount, particularly at higher-volume stores. It's important to not subject store management and grunt-level employees to the stress of being understaffed.

","Too much politics, people are very territorial and do not share any information. The secretive culture is taking a toll on progress and kills the spirit of innovation leading eventually a technical dysfunction; examples: Siri, Apple Map,Universal Wireless Charger,...). Bonus distribution is very skewed and depends very much on how well you can align yourself with the axis of power. People with no technical knowledge and contribution can be rewarded with huge bonuses.

2019-06-15, Engineer,"Sunnyvale, CA","Current Employee, more than 1 year",IS&T is a terrible terrible place to work as engineers !!,"- Apple brand on resume if you care about these sort of superficial things. 
- Product discounts
","- IS&T is the worst place to work for engineers. Swamped with 3rd party contractors, indian body-shop mostly, management treats them terribly. Rude, unprofessional and unethical work culture. Senior leadership within IS&T are terrible, egoistic megalomaniac, with zero leadership skills. They don't know how to lead by example.
- There is no place for engineers here in this group. Rampant politics and horrible work culture. Managers in this group are nothing but ""project managers"", who have no technical / engineering acumen, and have no eye towards architecture, code or good engineering practices. They treat engineers like second class citizens. These managers have no interest in career growth and development of their employees. All they care about is themselves and their RSU refreshers, appeasing their bosses anyway possible to get there.
- Most of the teams in IS&T build internal and corporate tools/applications. and they are dismal at that, from infrastructure to development processes, terrible..terrible !! You won't be working on anything world changing. 
- If you think you can change groups easily, you are sadly mistaken. It is very difficult to change groups/departments within Apple. You need to let your manager of your interest first, then go through the entire recruitment process, as if you are an external candidate, and if for whatever reason, you do not end up landing that new position, you would face extreme retaliation in your current team, your current manager would screw your career up. You would be ostracized, and he/she would make sure you have no future left in Apple. 
- IS&T has a bad reputation within apple, and every other group within apple treats IS&T folks that way. Other engineering groups are treated better. In short, apple has this subtle class-based culture. Not everyone is treated equally and respect.

If you are an engineer and thinking about joining Apple and IS&T assuming you would be able to do amazing engineering work, you are sadly mistaken. IS&T is the place where engineers come to destroy their career. My personal advice - Stay away from this group.
Advice to Management
Cleanup IS&T leadership and management. Get rid of poor performing managers and whose team has high turnover, and bring some engineering discipline within the group. Advice to Apple HR :- If you want engaging, motivated and happy employees, make it easy for people to change groups or departments, without this system/process that fosters retaliation and harassment.

2019-06-14, Apple College AHA,Cork,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",AppleCare AHA College Advisor,"Fantastic benefits - health, dental, product discounts, pension, life insurance, eye and vision plan, fitness and gym reimbursement, broadband reimbursement.

Salary exceeded my expectations, and is a lot better than other companies' support agent salary.

As a student, gives amazing flexibility and saves time travelling from college to work(home). Great support system in place, weekly team meetings. Time allocated for training and one on one with manager. 

If you are a problem solver, you will genuinely enjoy a lot of the calls. Added satisfaction from helping people in most cases.

Amazing training for the job, all paid. Top class, about 6 weeks in total, you will be totally prepared to take calls, no matter your skill level coming into the organisation. As well as continuous training when you are on the phones. 

Opportunities to progress.
","Can lead to feeling isolated. This is down to the advisor in my opinion, if you are not communicating with your team, manager etc.. and not participating in meetings. Working from home will not work for everyone. Important to have a social life outside of work! Leave the house everyday!

During busy periods calls can be very frequent - 7 seconds between calls. On the other hand, there are quiet periods too! Can get a lot of anger from customers directed at you, have to be someone with ability to take an objective approach and have thick skin.

Senior advisors can be rude and unhelpful when you contact them for help, especially if you want them to take the call over, whether the matter is in the customer's best interest / by protocol or not. This is not always the case but can get senior advisors with this attitude. Most senior advisors will be helpful. 

Opportunities to progress, but only within your current role i.e. up the support department ladder. In my experience, as a student, management do not want to hear about progressing into other departments such as development, testing or data analytics. You can apply for these roles internally, but there is a conflict of interest for management if you are valuable to your team.

- Very understanding when I was sick or had emergencies. 
- 401K, Stock-purchase program. 
- Discounts. (Not great)
","- Part-Time is NOT part time, you HAVE to work all weekends and work a minimum of 28 hours. No way around it. 
- Everyone is just so fake how it’s such a perfect company. 
- 0 Work life school balance. 
- You could hit various targets and be the best at like selling phones, Apple Care, ETC, but have one problem with business leads and you’re not eligible for promotion and you’re not good enough. Toss out everything you’ve accomplished, for one thing you struggle with. Seems to be a major/common problem with other employees I’ve spoken with. 
- Cannot climb the ladder, it’s just the same people who control everything.
Advice to Management
Realize the small things your employees do. Don’t forget all the good things and focus on the one bad thing like missing business leads, but having great sales, scores, ETC

2019-06-13, Manager,"Cupertino, CA","Former Employee, more than 1 year",Hostile media analytics organization,"Exposure to Apple's media products that are gaining traction quickly
","If you see an opening in the AMP (Apple media products) or iTunes analytics or data science team, and you are a non-white analytics professional who actually wants to grow (not become a reporting machine), avoid it at all cost.

The AMP analytics org is highly political and hostile towards other departments besides business and marketing who fund them. It’s now managed by a bunch of white males who took power but now don’t know how to bring in analytics talents with real industry experience or build a team that can serve all the reporting needs across the company. These guys have been at Apple for most of their careers, so they only know how to churn out reports with whatever data is available but don’t really know how to contextualize analytics insights. They’ve either hired query monkeys or diversity hires who are less than competent, while talents with real leadership and industry experience have departed. 

The culture of the teams within the org is finding scapegoats when they make mistakes, favoring and promoting white males, and managers taking all the credit for their team members’ hard work. There’s little opportunity to really grow in terms of your skill set and leadership, because everybody in the org now just kind of fake it til’ they make it.

Data engineering is extremely slow in providing support, and the backlog keeps getting pushed around from one team to another, so no real roadmap plus frustrated stakeholders.

In 2014, my wife was pregnant with our first child and I had made all the arrangements for it in terms of finance. I had saved enough money while taking into consideration the medical insurance available for employees at Apple. It is still provided by United Healthcare. The most important expense I wanted them to cover was NIPT which was very expensive and I simply couldn’t afford it. United Healthcare not only refused to accept my claim but gave me an extremely unbelievable reason for it. They said the minimum age required to be eligible for the same was 35. This is nothing short of a scam. Shame on Apple for supporting a corrupt organization like United Healthcare.

","What is unfortunate in the Apple, PIE group is how many truly bad managers there are and how rampant cronyism is within the company. HR issues are handled poorly if they get any response at all. As a result, you have to put up with bullying, favoritism and as a PM, you absolutely have no voice; your concerns carry zero weight. People get promoted because of who brought them into the company (there is a large Yahoo contingent currently within the PIE PMO). There are PMs who barely show up to work or who barely do competent work and they will die at Apple and continue to earn favorable reviews. If you’re not in the clique that matters, you’ll be shown the door. If you talk to your manager’s manager, you’re screwed, because those two people are friends.

Management is really nice and they make sure that you can learn and grow. Lots of room to move up within.
","It's a really big company so there is a large chain of people for certain tasks. If you ask your manager about scheduling, it goes to the next person above him and then the next and so on. Customers can be rude and it's not always super fun just sitting in front on a computer. I didn't like working in my room, but some people had at home offices they could use which probably would have helped.

","You will never get a weekend free. 
Management is petty and vengeful. 
The work is non-stop. 

You start your day with a “download”. This is a thinly veiled attempt to reinforce corporate groupthink so you can hit the floor and be a company shill. 
You start taking Genius Bar appointments immediately and the work is relentless. One angry customer after another, every ten minutes. And if you manage to find a small moment of peace with a funny or reasonable customer the lead genius will come over and force you to “multi-task”. That is, since you’re smiling, that means you have the capacity to attend two customers at once. 

And god forbid you have a five minute chat with a coworker to vent and clear your thoughts. That will get you reprimanded. 

Make no mistake, this job WILL burn you out. 

Having two days off in a row is a fleeting luxury, coming usually once a month or two. and Apple does this on purpose. 

Unless you have won a genetic lottery and are attractive. Then you can sleep with a manager and “earn” a merit increase or have some weekends approved. 

This happens CONSTANTLY. 

Employees will often sleep with each other, as well. Mainly because your erratic schedule will alienate you from everyone you care about, and prevent you from meeting new people. 

Once you are hired, your life becomes about one single purpose: get people to give their money to Apple and if they’re unhappy with their product, you have to fawn over them until they’re willing to spend more. 

Also, if you stand up for yourself and set boundaries of what kinds of unreasonable and abusive customers you are and aren’t willing to interact with? Or what kind of work / life balance is acceptable? Boom. That’s it. You’re never getting a raise again and everything but the legal minimum for time off is what you can expect to see. 

Then you will clock out for lunch. And if you are literally one minute late, and I do mean literally, you will be taken into the office and reprimanded. Clock in early all you want, but if you’re one minute late, you’re in trouble. 

But the creepy middle aged dork in sales that is a sexual predator and corners young women and tries to convince them to sleep with him? That guy will work there for YEARS because he can generate revenue. 

And at the end of your day, you will be forced to sit through an “upload”. This yet another thinly veiled attempt to reinforce corporate groupthink and try to make you forget the gruelling, depressing 9 hours you just spent in a silver, windowless, featureless rectangle of a room getting belittled and accused by selfish, whiny children hiding in adult bodies because they can’t bear to be without their overpriced, luxury cell phones for eight seconds. Its like if a liquor store opens and you’re forced to apologize and placate all the jonesing alcoholics whom spent an hour waiting to yell at you because they had to spend a whole night without any vodka. 

But you’ll clock out ten minutes late at ten at night because of that stupid upload and you make your way home in a rush since you have to be up at 7AM to do it all again. 

Because it’s a Saturday and there will already be a line of people outside the store, clutching to their liquid damaged iPhones, shaking with withdrawal and eager to tell you it’s your fault that they broke it because you should’ve made the phone everything-proof.

Decent company to work in
Friendly colleagues. 
Stock grant is nice. 
Gym is cheap
","This review is for the technical support job only.
The money isn't worth the mental health issues you will get. 
Earn about 1400-1500 before probation --> 1600-1700 after probation
Average salary in Ireland is 37000. After probation you are on about 27000.
Rent in Cork is disgustingly high between 400 if crappy to 700 ish a month
High stress.
Terrible customers. 
Pretty much anyone will call you from 10 year olds to 90 year olds, so you can imagine the level of adaptability you will need. 
Nothing really technical about technical support -> if you have ever seen the IT crowd its similar. 
Most people burn out within the first year or 2.
Most people quit after having done 1 year so its just on their CV.
Internal job transfer has a lot of requirements so its probably easier to just quit and reapply as they tend to mostly recruit from outside unless its technical support where they need every random person to join them due to people quitting constantly.
Advice to Management
As you can see by my comments above I have very little positive things to say. My opinion is obviously biased. Not much I can give in regards to advice as it is customer support which is crap everywhere. I highly recommend anyone planning on joining technical support to only use it as a springboard as this job is incredibly mentally draining and stressful.

Advice to Management
Selecting leadership is a very long process yet the interviews are just based off of stories and some prior experience. Knowledge and skills are passed off in favor of prepared interview answers. Actively engage the employees who want to help improve the overall workflow of the company and drive results. Getting stories to show off metrics and results doesn't hide the fact that company shifted from treating employees as people and creating an active environment for growth to people being numbers and needing to focus on metrics.

","Strange insurance benefits! I can say this from personal experience from when my wife was pregnant. The plan does not offer cover for prenatal genetic testing for expecting women under 35. How does that make sense? If a medical plan does not cover an unaffordable but required procedure such as NIPT, what purpose does it really serve? Most women experience at least one pregnancy during their twenties or early thirties. This logic seems to escape the management somehow.

2019-05-17, Manager,,"Former Employee, more than 3 years",Apple Review,"Great company overall, good benefits, stability
","Retail environment is a game of favorites no matter how you slice the cake. Popularity beats talent. Interviews are only formalities. If you're lucky enough to have the majority of the leadership team like you, you can maybe move up. 

Each market is different in their approach and it's a roll of the dice. I worked for three different markets and the last one was all driven by numbers. My advice is that if your ideas aren't being heard or considered and you're being driven to drive sales, move on. It's easy to get stuck here and while it's not a bad place to get stuck, you deserve to be somewhere that gives you growth potential and a feeling of true contribution.

You are dealing with things on a global level so you are working in a massive enoviornment. One of the best things I ever did was work there because I know I am the better for it. You will push yourself due to some great people around you and you will get better as an employee. If you want to succeed you can, but be prepared to do a lot of brown nosing. Your talen alone wont get you far, but that can be said for a lot of places
","Unfortunately being based in Cork, there is a lot of nepotism as they have been in Cork for nearly 40 years. Friends of friends are hired and family members which you could hinder your development. If your face doesnt fit you wont go very far. I joined an expanding team and was so excited, but I had on average nearly managers a year as a result. So reviews were never with the same person and if you got on with one manager and didnt with another you would still be get a bad review. There is also a lot of plagerism and idea stealing by managers for them to succeed whilst you get a little bonus, they will have gotten shares for nearly €100,00. During product launches, be prepard to forget about your life. You will work 70 hours a week and you will work from home at the weekends. At some stage you will suffer from burnout.

If your goal is to get a higher up position you need to have patience, do your best at whatever you´re doing, take ownership of your development, and don´t get bitter if you don´t manage to get a better position - the competition is harsher the higher the position. 

- not treated as a third class citizen even if holding a bottom position in the company

- Apple has amazing politics ""if you see something, say something"" - that is: if you or anyone of your peers gets treated unfairly don´t keep it for yourself.

- there is room to grow - but you need to own your development and fight for it. The competition is harsh as there are so many people wanting to work for this company.

- Apple operates in so many locations so it´s not impossible to move around. They offer rotation opportunities, job shadowing.
","- the secrecy: it´s difficult to actually talk to people from different departments because of Apple´s secrecy policy.

","Things are very decentralized and there's little visibility outside of your team.
Some teams just struggle to get resources. The company is massive but only seems to really care about or prioritize certain projects that executives are interested in.
Tons of bureaucracy. Does not feel like you can grow a career here past the lowest levels. Promotions are extremely difficult to get.
Most people are focused on their own careers, meeting deadlines, getting their managers off their backs. People like to say they care about the customer but most meetings are just about getting stuff out the door on time, not about quality products.
Employee perks are nonexistent. You will find yourself being told that the perks of working for Apple are working for Apple.
Parking is atrocious. I spend 30+ minutes a day parking.
Advice to Management
You need to care more about the product than delivering features on time, and reward engineers who care about the product, not rank them based on arbitrary measures of impact. Promotions shouldn't require an engineer to sell their soul, stop caring about customers, and do meaningless work just to impress executives.

Apple as a company will try and convince you otherwise, but my issue here isn’t with their ideology, but moreso the delusion that comes with the reality of working in Apple Retail. 

Considering this is now a trillion dollar company. The pay is simply too low considering what’s expected of you. Apple might be one of the most difficult companies to get accepted for. Passing probation is even harder, yet they don’t pay significantly more than anyone else. In fact, in recent years, they’ve actually fallen behind in terms of how much they pay compared to other similar companies. 

I’ve worked in 5 different Apple stores across my 4 and a half year tenure and experienced woeful management across the board. Micro managers, bullies, politicians. 

The politics in this company are probably the worst I’ve seen in any company I’ve ever worked at. Trying to make a career out of Apple is frankly borderline impossible unless you’re in bed with the right people. Half the time you just aren’t told what you need to do to become good enough for a particular role. When you are told, its deliberately vague and tricky to figure out. But It’s quite simple really. If you’re liked by the right people, you can ascend to ridiculous heights and have the career of your life here. If not, you’ll struggle forever while management constantly try to put you down and break you. For most of us, the latter is what happens, but there are those who accept it and those who fight it.
Advice to Management
I think everyone can agree that a pay bump is necessary considering how hard it is to get into this company and how much work your employees put in on a daily basis. This is brought up every time people fill out NPP and it’s brushed under the rug every single time. 

An actual transparent career path would also be great; one that rewards hard work rather that politics. 

It would also be great if you actually hired managers who could think for themselves rather than puppets who blindly follow orders. What happened to the company that was so known for innovation?

","Too much micro-management 
Always monitored by management. Can barely go to toilet without getting message from boss about being inactive.
Too high expectations from Management to hit KPI - they care more about quantity than quality.
No team morale. Management don't even introduce you to your colleagues when you start.
No communication with management except for when you do something ""wrong"" like taking too long to get your coffee.
Advice to Management
Learn how to manage a team. Good communication and treating your employees like adults is key. Provide feedback not only when something is ""wrong"".
Stop the monitoring and have trust in your employees. Make new hires feel welcome and part of the team by introducing them. Make sure all managers know how to speak English in order to communicate with employees (perhaps organize English-class if needed)

2019-04-28, App Developer,"Cupertino, CA","Former Employee, more than 1 year","Apple IS&T, toxic place, not actually Apple","You get Apple on your resume. Engineers are nice for the most part.
","Apple IS&T is the worst, most toxic environment at Apple. When you work here, you do not really work for Apple, you are like outsiders. It is truly scary that a place like this can exist at a company like Apple. You should not join. Good people cannot fix broken environments. The place is broken because of legacy culture from the top.

They will make it sound nice and paint a nice picture with words, but once you get there, you will realize you are trapped in a bait and switch, career suicide. They could get sued for this. Many managers are mean, incompetent, or aggressive slave drivers. Stay away.
Advice to Management
You at least need to overhaul / modernize IS&T, and put in real technical leadership. Imagine if this were a place that naturally attracted top infra talent, like Google, Facebook or Netflix? 

The whole business partner vs IS&T partner creates never ending division and attracts mean / micro managers and results in a diversity and inclusion issue. Imagine for a moment if the business partners actually hired the engineers they depend on. Or do they not have the technical acumen? Or is the work too unattractive / dirty? Do you really need 30 contractors when 2 FTE engineers would get the job done?

You can do better than this.

If you want to become a overall better person they provide the tools and guidance. Work hard, play hard mentality. Getting in at Apple isn't easy so it helps to know someone and they refer you. Some of the best leaders around work there, but not all leaders share the same vision. Work/life balance is very important to them and they give you lots of time to take off. Employee purchase plan is also nice, but could be better. Overall I had one of the best working experiences with this company.
","Not the most autonomy, although the managers try their best to convince you. Extremely competitive to move up, can become political. I've heard pay has improved although it definitely could have been more competitive for the work and the results. Depending on what market you are located in, there can be an extreme push for results.

2019-04-24, Director,"London, England, England","Former Employee, more than 8 years","Incredible Company, But Not For Everyone","You will never work with a company with a greater focus on delivering products that work for who they're intended for. The culture is immersive and exciting at all times and there are some great minds at the Company. Diversity and inclusion are at the core of the Company's values and you are rewarded very well (provided you meet Apple's expectations - see other section!)
","Forget external perceptions of Apple being full on entrepreneurial thinkers - there are plenty but the only ones allowed to BE entrepreneurial are those in control in Cupertino. If you're working in the regions, 90% of what you do will be driven by HQ in California. Apple has a saying; ""all the accountability, none of the responsibility"", meaning you're accountable, but will have little control over the product, marketing or Apple way of executing your job. In addition, there is a cultural flaw at Apple; more people get fired for trying to be inventive (and hence going against the Cupertino grain), than those that are hopeless but learn to keep their head down and do what Cupertino say at all times. You are expected to be creative in delivery, but only up to the point where you don't question the Company's activity. The down side to that is there are plenty of long time senior Apple managers in Cupertino that have never been out of California and don't get the challenges in the regions at all, but use the ""it's Apple's will, just do it"" excuse to bully you.
Advice to Management
Change the way you lead employees, stop trying to assimilate them too far into the ""Apple Way"" and allow them to challenge what goes on without fear someone in Cupertino will be offended by that.

2019-04-21, Global Supply Manager,"Cupertino, CA","Former Employee, less than 1 year",Not Sustainable - You feel disposable and used,"You get to work at ""Apple"". Whatever that means to you. To me it meant nothing.
","It is a high stress job involving travel to China. Since Apple products are assembled in China, thats where most of the action happens from a Supply Chain and Operations perspective. My days started early with calls with teams in Europe. During the day i was working with teams in US. From evening until night, I was on calls with teams in China as you get a lot of requests. It was a 24x7 thankless job. If you have time to manage two projects, you'll always have four. You are not innovating or designing cool products in Supply Chain. You are only making sure these products are ready when customers want it. The only differentiator in performance is the number of hours you put in. 
1. There are not many people with great backgrounds here. Most of the folks are from supply chain backgrounds from random less reputed companies or business schools for whom having Apple on the CV is a huge uplift. Some people with good background are at senior positions who joined Apple in the early days and they are enjoying their million dollar valuation of stocks.
2. Leadership: Apple loves engineers. Most people in managerial roles got promoted from IC engineering roles and do not have an iota of aura or leadership qualities. They are very arrogant and don't care about people.
3. The work is very stressful with aggressive targets and you have to always be on top of China. I have seen people break down in meetings. Many people had health issues and were always looking to exit. Having alcohol on your table is common. There is no time for personal life. When you join you are given a paper that says 'the work you will do is so great that people dont mind spending their weekends here'. Thats a hint. LOL
4. Average employee turnover time is ten months. It is just not sustainable and that is why you can always find tons of open GSM roles on the Apple website. Apple is now a big organization and it is tough to move up and steer the politics. 
5. Culture: There is no culture. Every person is on his/her own. There is no collaboration. No one likes to share anything and people keep fighting to prove their point. You'll be doing everything yourself from scratch everytime and that will add to the hours and frustration. In my team, people fought for air time and tried to make loud conversations with team mates when manager was around. It was fake environment. The director would come to happy hour in team area for two minutes and take a mental head count of who all were present and who all were not participating in this 'team event'. 
6. Even with Apple salary, you'll just make your ends meet as this is one of the most expensive part of the world. You will never be able to afford to buy a house. You'll shell out all your money on rent and survival stuff. 
7. Career Opportunities: Depends on your relations. However every project is secretive and that limits your opportunities. Also, you can only move within your vertical. Moving to Applecare is not possible. Also, my manager dint help me in any way to find a new role when i wanted to change roles. Thats common. Also, you'll be hired because you can do the job well. Apple will not invest in your to develop new skills. You'll be doing the same work your entire life. 

In short working at Apple involves high stress, all your hours, no new skills development and little savings. The only thing you get is an Apple name on your CV. Is it worth it? You decide for yourself. International folks with MBA, this role is a trap and its tough to get out. There are better options out there. Check out how this role is rated on transparentcareer and you'll get more data points.

2. Dont treat your employees as you treat your suppliers, i.e. with arrogance. Invest in them and train them as humans and not slaves. 
3. Treat your suppliers better.

","- Recruiters are usually bad and unprofessional. They usually try to lowball you (as typical) but if you try to negotiate, they become aggressive and even rude.
- Very unbalanced compensation even within the same teams. Study up your numbers well before signing up.
- Secrecy
- Very non-uniform groups within the company. There are big differences between different organizations so you might have totally different experience for the same/similar job responsibilities depending on whether you are part of engineering, operations or (scary, the one to avoid at all cost) IS&T groups.

2019-04-19, Lead Genius,"Houston, TX","Former Employee, more than 5 years",Their Soul is Their People,"Genuinely amazing teams at those stores. Apple focuses diligently on bringing in the best of the best when they can.
Stock rewards that vest over time when performance is exceptional or above the average. 
AMAZING HEALTH BENEFITS. Maternity leave was stellar. 
Opportunities to advance when the current roles are met appropriately.
","Retail leadership can treat their roles as if they're literally curing cancer, making them seem hard to relate to and holier than thou.
Difficulty in communication transparency for the team members that aren't the ideal ""perfect employee"". Lack of confrontation skills keep leaders really vague on true opportunities that individuals needs to correct in order to advance.
No true time and attendance policy - holding those accountable for terrible attendance to work is not consistent from store to store because certain stores can have managers who stick to a guide, while other stores can have leadership teams with no backbones and are too wrapped up in their own agendas to really care about the stores.
Leaders can know WHO the problematic contributors are, but have minimal resources to truly performance manage those people out. That creates a toxic culture of those problematic ones campaigning to bring other passive mindsets to the detractor ways.
Advice to Management
Remember your greatest asset is your people. Invest in them wisely, or else they'll pack up and leave. Remember that you're not reinventing the wheel and treat every day in your own store as if Tim himself were watching you.

2019-04-19, Apple At Home Advisor,"Baton Rouge, LA","Former Employee, more than 1 year",Overall not a great experience,"Some good benefits including 401k, product discounts, and stock option. Some flexibility in scheduling as a part of the College Program, as they set your schedule by semester according to the schedule of classes you submit to them. There are opportunities for educational reimbursement for qualifying courses. If you like apple branded swag they definitely give you a lot of it!
","Performance is based on metrics that are not necessarily reflective of your work - they send vague email surveys to customers asking them how satisfied they were with their call experience. Of course, if they are out of warranty (majority of customers) and we cannot help them they are not going to be satisfied. One or two of these negative surveys will really impact your metrics. Escalation to Tier 2 will also impact your metrics even if it is truly beyond your control (bugs in new OS update, faulty product, etc). There is a lot of push to sell stuff to customers. Managers only care about the numbers. It is a very corporate culture that can often feel cultish. The requirement to work on Christmas/holidays is unfortunate. Very low wages in the College Program. I have heard from other employees that management could view your screens and access your camera without your knowledge, which is terrifying but I am not sure of how true it is. This position is often emotionally draining, as most people who call are upset about experiencing a technical issue, and a lot of them will take it out on you. Obviously, as an at-home position, it can be quite isolating.
Advice to Management
Place less emphasis on metrics, which are often skewed by one or two bad CSATs that were sent by angry customers who were out of warranty or whose problems could not be resolved due to issues outside of the advisor's control. Technical training was somewhat adequate, but the position really is about providing customer care. More training for actually dealing with customers/managing expectations would be helpful but I understand the limitations in providing training for that - it is very situational. However, more support could be given to advisors in general.

","Moving slowly into a more data-driven culture. A lot of things are done according to people who have been at the firm for a long time. There are organizational habits that are difficult to change, and making it potentially difficult for data science to have a bigger voice in decision making (but it certainly depends on your organization).

","Management claims to care about work-life balance, but then schedules you for early morning and late night meetings on weekend days even if it's outside of your availability. 

There's also zero room for growth in the company unless you're willing to sell your soul out to metrics and jump through every flaming hoop that your connection manager demands of you. Over the past several years, the Genius Bar has been progressively overrun and infested with a rabid sales culture. The job of a TS is now more about peddling and pushing services and building leads for the business team to follow up on than it is about actual troubleshooting. It's absolutely miserable, and the constant badgering by connection managers who claim to care about your ""development"" while simultaneously degrading you if you don't meet sales metrics expectations only makes things worse. You are able to submit feedback to leadership on a bi-annual basis about ways the workplace can improve, but I have yet to see management ever make any meaningful course corrections to match the responses they get.
Advice to Management
You are the reason why people quit this company to take their professional pursuits elsewhere. Ordering pizza every few months for the team doesn't make up for the degrading experience of having to perform the role of a salesman when you applied to do tech support and help people.

There are no opportunities for growth. Promotions are not in any way based on performance/contribution. 
As one the top performers I constantly get passed on any promotions, declined on interviews e.g, which demotivates extremely. 
Hard work is not recognized or valued. Be prepared to be stuck in a position for a very long time. If you want a company where you are valued and promoted on performance Apple is not the company to work for.

It's sad that after working there for over 3 years and being one of the best in my group there is no way for growth/development and no valuation for performing at peak levels consistently.

2019-04-06, Mac Expert,Cork,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",AHA Mac+,"-Working from home
-Internet reimbursement but seriously that does not cover the stress you are going through
-buying company shares
","From where should I start:
1. The metrics are out of your control:
You get evaluated on Customer Surveys and even though you are at 100%, you get a survey from a call that the line dropped and you never spoke to the customer and you may even end up at 70% without even having handled that call!!! And they don’t remove that survey from your stats!!!even though you never handled the call!!! In order for your stats to recover you need to have for every negative survey (that you never even handled) you need 9 positive surveys. However that negative survey will follow you for the next 16 weeks (period of evaluation) which means that you get to recover from that after 4 months for a call in which you NEVER talked to the customer!!!
2. T2 escalations: try to get better and Let me know...There are so many cases owned by T2 that customers call and you have to transfer the call to a T2. It is mandatory even if you know the answer. Now it is a mandatory escalation- AGAIN OUT OF YOUR CONTROL. BUT it counts negatively on YOUR STATS! Yeap! Beat that! Not to mention that you may get a T2 who will just hang up on you because he doesn’t know the answer and you will need to double escalate!
3. Benefits: not clear requirements
They say they have paid family care but then they put you on unpaid leave even though you have provided ALL medical documents for your child. And they won’t tell you. Your manager won’t even tell you and on the 25th of the month, you check your salary and it is chopped even though you even had holidays left to get!
4. Extremely Fast pace environment and the knowledge is everywhere: NOT CENTRALISED information. You try to keep yourself updated and you definitely need hours outside work as you have one call after the other and it is not possible to keep up!!!
5. “Management is empowered to be powerless”: the managers rarely know anything. They are probably so overwhelmed themselves that they can’t keep up and can never give you a reasonable explanation. You ask them why is that and they tell you: “because that is the way I DO IT”
6. In order to get holidays you need to book 6 months in advance
7. 1/3 of Apple is on stress, emotional, anxiety leave. Most employees: if you could only see us how we look on the team video meetings. Drained! Totally drained!
8. Employee Surveys: THEY ask for your feedback but they never take it into consideration. If you dare to say your opinion in a team meeting you are considered toxic even though they asked for your opinion (personally I have never expressed my opinion but I have witnessed it in team meetings) and if that employee tries to say anything again, the manager will just interrupt him and say “we have no time for this” even though we all agree but we are scared we may be the black sheep after a while...
9. It is a good place to work only if you are not on CUSTOMER SERVICE. If you have a good position yes go ahead
But if you are a common mortal like the most of us, don’t do that to yourself... the benefits that they say you have: most of them depend on management approval like Studies or Paid Family Care etc so nothing special really.
10. Progress within the company: most people won’t handle it so after a year they quit. So the ones who progress are mostly people with no obligations and eventually progress from seniority. There were times they got T1 to T2 even though they didn’t meet the stats because of demand. So some of them ended up clueless managers. Don’t get me wrong not all of them are like this but there is a lot of incompetence in the management especially when they don’t know their things... not all of them say the same thing. I have changed 6 managers so far. I have seen a TM assistant getting the same job done in one day and another team manager claiming he cannot do it and it is out of his control. So there is really no consistency.
Advice to Management
Get Humble
Being a Manager does not mean that you have the power to treat T1 like zero. We are the front line please respect that. Especially if you have been at our place. 
You Try FIRST to get one call after the other and try to achieve the stats you expect us to get. In the end you treat us like numbers and like machines. But keep in min that if your customers liked “automated machines” they would never call us the call center to speak to an advisor. We are the ones who add value to your products and your services especially when your products fail. We care about your customers, so please don’t treat us like garbage especially when we don’t deserve it... the stress we are going through and that 1/3 of Apple is either on antidepressants or talking to your Occupational Health Department says a lot..

Most people work hard because they love Apple products. You'll likely find a team that cares about the work they do. Few people are lazy. 
Work / Life balance, some teams definitely care about this and give you flexible hours.
","Apple uses their own systems and they are bad.

Little impact on the product because the company is so top heavy. 
The company is so secretive, people just aren't friendly. 
There's a huge division between those who work at Apple Park and those who don't. You're automatically seen as more valuable if you work at Apple Park.

Advice to Management
Profit sharing? Purpose? Dig deep on who u r as a company. what do ur employees mean to the bottom line. How r u helping humanity today. The planet? The new campus is phenomenal and ridiculous at the same time. A monument to vanity. Lovely to look at but arguably terrible for productivity. You were suppose to be the woman with the javelin in the 1984 commercial, not the screen. Getting what you wish for is always dangerous. Wake up.

Advice to Management
Nothing personal against the employees or managers of the company. Enjoyed the time I worked with the At-Home Team. But when an individual has an impairment or inability to work on the job effectively, the management should take greater effort to insure that employee can do their job comfortably even amidst busy periods. Please create greater awareness for individuals wanting to work with you who may fall on the Autism spectrum or have high-functioning Aspergers Syndrome.

","Advancement in my time (5yrs) seems impossible unless you have the right people backing you or know people. Connections vs capability.
Most experience outside of Apple doesn't seem to matter, its again what you know internally and who you know.
Some managers seem too far removed from the role of the employees they manage.
You can tell who is working for you, the customer and the company and those who are either complacent and/or just there for a check.
Advice to Management
Look at the teams and employees and really see who cares about what they do. Maybe in addition to managers have ORG leaders who help with real career advancement, yes I know you offer PTS, but most of the time its so short and generic. Don't be afraid to retain or release people who don't care about the job. 
I honestly love this company and hoped to make a career here, but in being blunt if I'm not kissing up to the right people, or have a TM or AM that really wants to back me. My time and experience doesn't matter.

Once hired as part-time your chances of becoming full-time even if you out perform your peers is very low, unless you kiss the right butt, or you’re a minority. The store manager even verbalized in multiple meetings that “she wants us to refer women and minorities because we have enough white guys”. Because the store manager came from Target, she seems to get a kick out of filling other leadership positions with external candidates instead of promoting from within. Extremely high turnover because of favoritism and poor management decisions.
Advice to Management
Promote from within. You can’t be at a “Pro Level” if your last job was at a Home Depot and you’re not even comfortable selling a Mac. Store management needs an overhaul before you get sued for the ignorance that is spewed by management.

","Constant change in structure and a lot of responsibility for others mistakes. No upfront mention of pay in job roles so the pay can vary greatly.

Performance structure is very dependent on relationships with direct manager.
Advice to Management
Pay structure and raises need to be re-evaluated. Also, there needs to be a way for management to review customer reviews in a similar way to peer review taking into account the entire interaction neutrally. This would also allow removal of reviews in error.

","They do not care about how long you've been with the company. New employees get paid just as much if not more than employees that have been there for several years. Internal hiring is not a thing at apple so don't expect a promotion unless you hit their unrealistic numbers. They're more likely to hire someone from starbucks who has no idea what they're doing than promote someone who's been there forever. 

Bottom line is this: You can be great at your job and not receive a promotion. Also tenure does not matter at all. The other option is to kiss your manager's ""insert word here"". Your best bet is to get some years under your belt and find a better job elsewhere.

You get to meet and work with a lot of great people.
Nature of the job leads you to gain a lot of personal growth in developing interpersonal skills.
Typically, leadership and team members will have your back when it comes to support.
Helps develop emotional IQ.
Sounds a little cliched, but there are times when you and a customer will truly connect and you will feel their gratitude deeply. This can be quite overwhelming sometimes (in the best way).
","It's retail, so can be both physically and emotionally draining at peak times.
They make it so it feels good where you're at which can lead to a risk of getting complacent and next thing you know you've been there longer than you intended.
While there is somewhat of a clear path to advancement, management can lean toward favoritism in lieu of job qualifications when it comes to promotions.
Advice to Management
Take the time to calmly look at those you lead and appreciate them as people. The leadership (at least at our store) is typically focused on results and/or customer experience. Employee experience can be forgotten at times and some of them just need to know they are being seen and appreciated for the often times challenging work.

Great benefits for a retail job.
Fun people to work with.
Lots of positions to choose from.
The stores are guaranteed to be clean.
Easy to transfer locations
","Poor and disorganized management at almost every location.
Can be very demanding if you go to school or have a second job.
Stores are always busy, and inefficient.
If you hold an unpopular opinion about a corporate policy it will effect you negatively.
Lack of diversity.
Corporate culture can come off as condescending and egocentric.

Truly first class coworkers and the culture within my org was supportive. I could really focus on the work in a way I couldn't at other larger companies and I knew that my contribution was amounting to an important impact for users. The skills I learned here have translated forward to other jobs I have had afterwards and I am certain I am a better engineer for having spent time here.
","Not sure if it is a ""con"" per-se but Apple is very secretive and you are expected to be part of that. You might have to avoid talking about the specifics of what you do with friends and sometimes even other co-workers.

Advice to Management
Employees should come before the process and the numbers! Check ego and pride at the door. Serve your team and you'll see results. Managers, get to know your team. It's ok to say hi once in a while--authentically. 

Start here...get to know them, then you'll understand what buttons need to be pressed to get the best performance from each individual on your team.

I can honestly say in my three years of working here I am a much better person in my professional and personal life from the knowledge I gained from working here. The pay and benefits are great compared to anywhere else I could work part time. Discounts for friends and family. Very flexible scheduling. Management actually cares about you. Your store becomes like a second family. Its easy to move up if you do well and communicate your successes to your direct manager. Its good to brag about yourself so that your work gets noticed. You can also do career experiences in Cupertino. Some people even go from retail to corporate just by doing a career experience depending on your background.
","There are few stores so sometimes you have to commute to your location. The stores are often very cold. Robberies have become more prominent in the last year. Customers can be very rude.

Don't give in too easily to the demand of the customer especially if it conflicts with what the specialist told the customer. I wish it was easier to get weekends off. Its hard because you have to request time off nearly two months in advance to get it off.

The job is VERY repetitive week-to-week for around 6 months, so you there's a steep learning curve for the first month or two, and then gets somewhat tedious.

","The hours are ridiculous if you're part-time. You'll still work 5 days a week but only 4 or 5 hours a day with some periods of working close to full-time hours until they need to scale you back so you don't automatically get moved to a full-time employee. You have to deal with some of the worst customers who are ungrateful, rude, entitled, and will snap at anything. It can be near impossible to get promoted depending on the store you work in. If you work in a popular store, the role you're applying for will likely go to a transfer instead so. The pay raises and reviews are an absolute joke. The company will act like you are the most important thing ever, but I think this really only applies if you work at corporate. You'll spend all your time trying to get into corporate but you'll have to be there for a long time, kiss a lot of behind, or you'll be stuck in retail forever.

Stop treating Apple retail like a career opportunity for your employees, or start making changes to make it one. At the moment, it's not viable to stay there as a career long term (unless you want to move to CA and work at corporate). A few years as a resume builder is a great idea, though.

","Oh boy here we go 

Customers ( or people in pocession of a iOS device to be exact ) are very rude and abusive be prepared to have racist remarks said to you. And nothing will be done by management. There was one case where this customer was ringing up drunk and abusing tier 1 and on to tier 2 advisors every day for months and repeat over a broken phone that was 10 years old. It’s 2019. It’s ok to fire the customer. 

Call after call. Three seconds intervals. 

The support offered by tier 1 is so broad that Is stressful because you may not encounter the same issue for months and you forget. 

Shifts last 13 weeks and you have to be in the top 5 percent to pick your shifts. I achieved this once but it impossible to sustain as the goal posts are always changing. Be prepared you could easily get a Thursday to Tuesday shift 1130 to 8 pm. There is also no allowance for personal circumstances such as family commitments. Your shift is your shift and that’s that. There is a swap programme but it’s full of people with terrible shifts looking for a less awful shift. 

8 mins a day toilet break or personal time. Go over this time and expect a discussion sheet. 

Leave one minute early and get a discussion sheet but it’s okay to be on a call 30 mins after u finish. 

Holiday booking is bizarre. There is group allowance and you book 6 months in advance. If the hours are not available you need to grovel for a exception so you can go to Majorca with your family. 

Every year you are told you are working Xmas day and then around early December they tell you that it’s closed for Xmas day and your supposed to thank them and sing hallelujah because they gave you Xmas day off. How nice. But your working every other day over Xmas. Believe that. 

Tier 2 support overall are nice. There are the guys who you ring to when you have lost your reason to live and want to die. They can be grumpy but I don’t blame them. They put up with the worst calls. 

There are benefits such as health insurance product discounts etc but most multi national companies offer these anyway. You pay benefit in kind on all insurance and dental and gym reimbursement so it’s not really free at all. 

The day drags and isolation is a major problem. You be talking to yourself on your breaks after a year if your house is empty where you work.

- Legitimizes your professionalism and the skills it takes to acquire to get to that point in your career. 
- The people - if you're fortunate you will meet some great people, find a mentor and keep in touch regardless of who you call your employer. 
- Some teams are very flexible with great work/life balance. I was fortunate to be part of several teams like this. 
- Ability to move around within the company (laterally).
- Product discounts (because if you were getting paid a higher salary than Apple, you wouldn't be accepting the offer right?)
- Pads your resume nicely
- You get to say you work at Apple and make mom and dad proud, if that's your thing
","- Average Salary (they know folks like saying they work there and ego wins most of the time)
- After a few years, politics will become very evident and part of it is keeping the status quo (i.e. innovation has declined you could apply the proverb here ""The nail that sticks out..."")
- Inconsistent policies within organizations (Some teams within the same division/organization are 9-5, others are flexible - up to your manager)
- Apple has become that which it once stood against (an inevitability)

That's what happens here. If you're good at your job and you care about what you do, management will wring you for all you're worth until you're nothing but a desiccated husk. The smart ones will leave before that happens.

Each store is different. I worked at 3. Some managers were amazing and truly cared about developing people, and some were poor at managing a high performing team. Keep doing NPP and seeking feedback, and act on it. If employees report trends or opportunities for management, look into it. Sometimes we’d go a full year before any real action plans to correct bad behavior from management were revealed or implemented.

1. Human Beings work here. Increase pay to ""Adult Wage"" instead of ""Living Wage"". Pay needs increase substantially for Applecare and Apple Retail employees. We are the first point of contact for our customers, and, as expected, our level of knowledge and competency set's the standard for call centers and retail employees in all industries. 
 
 2. If multiple complaints filed against abusive managers, provide coaching / training to said managers. If more complaints continue, reassign to a non-leadership role, or, promote manager to ""customer"". It's rare, but abusive humans exist everywhere. 

3. Create an open and clear path for employees of Apple Retail and Applecare to enter positions in Apple Corporate. Right now, it's best described as a ""black box"" experience. 

4. Increase remote positions within corporate. The standard has been set with Applecare remote workers. It's time to change the 20th century paradigm of having to ""commute"" to a work place when your role does not involve manufacturing.

What’s surprised me was how much I’ve grown to love coming to work. My colleagues are solid, empathic people whose company I enjoy very much. Leadership is supportive, and I learn something new every shift.
","While the vast majority of customer interactions are positive when they are not, they are quite something. People either rely on our products to a degree that a problem puts them in panic/crisis mode and we are tasked to solve the impossible. More often a customer is angry about a company decision “why did you people get rid of all the traditional ports on the new MacBook Air?” Sometimes it’s tough to role with that.

2019-02-17,Anonymous,,"Former Employee, more than 5 years",Great company to work for despite talent retention issues,"Fantastic benefits, feels good to say you work for 'Apple', great career opportunities if you work hard and are a go-getter
","Unfortunately, despite spending 5 years on developing someone, they let them go so easily – because there's no talent team watching and monitoring internal talent. Apple invested lots of time and money into my personal and professional development and then let me leave to join another business because of their lack of opportunities given to internal talent.
Advice to Management
Keep your eye on internal talent at lower levels (i.e. retail and low level corporate), have a team who monitor and work with 'top internals' to ensure they don't leave but instead progress within Apple.

PTO for vacations and sick time is added every check
Discounted Apple products
Great opportunity to move up if you're GOOD and consistent in your position
","Micro managed SEVERELY, someone is watching your every move every second and it's documented
Apple wants you to be a robot, they want to MOLD you, if you can't be molded i.e quiet, passive, not argumentative or opinionated you're a perfect fit, if not? Stop while you're ahead
Apple is ALWAYS understaffed for customer service, be aware. Retail store sends customers to YOU, even if you send them to the store. The stores do nothing but repairs and sell products.
The sole component of Apple is their customer service, you're are the glue. If you're not the best glue, understand you will be stressed because someone will remind you daily.
Not worth it if you're a college student, unless you're graduating.
Benefits do not outweigh the emotional and verbal abuse by management.
Advice to Management
Stop lying to your employees and teaching them that you're a top tier company that doesn't make sense. And please stop saying ""Apple has been doing this for years"" just because you've done something and it worked then doesn't mean it's working now. Find new ways to implement training and teaching so you can retain your employees.

","Corporate keeps technicians in the dark about issues with the products and then expects them to do their dirty work explaining it to the customers with little to zero info. Forcing “part time” employees to have 30 hours of availability during the week. Rule school or your second job out! The work is brutal. Customers are mostly either neutral or nasty. Very rarely did I find myself actually being able to solve problems or make people happy. Leaders dangle carrots in front of employees for promotions they won’t see for a long time. Benefits are great but they aren’t worth it in the big picture. Trust me, giving up the benefits is a small price to pay for sanity. I’ve been much happier since I quit. Work there for a year, lock in your passion in the mean time, and then get out of there! I am not writing all this out of bitterness. I left on good terms and am still re-hireable. I worked at three different locations and just want people to know what to expect under the hood. You WILL encounter these issues.

2019-02-02, Senior User Experience Designer III,"Cupertino, CA","Former Employee, more than 5 years",Remnants of what it used to be... but with enormous career benefits,"From a senior designer perspective across multiple orgs and 5 years
- resume booster / career validation
- great if your satisfied with the status quo and want a paycheck to retire with
- you can say you work at apple if that sort of thing matters
- if you get on the right team, there are awesome people there
","- inconsistent creative direction or vision
- groups within the same org can function 110% different ranging from the 9-5 group to the laid back results oriented group.
- politics and stereotypes internally abound. Was “let go” after a lengthy investigation on a violation of a policy enacted 2 years after I was hired. No psa of new zero tolerance policies, or so they said. 
- certain orgs acquire agencies and they bring that dynamic with them. Most of the time they’re siloed which is good but if you’ve been part of an agency you probably don’t want that culture in your day to day anymore
- if you want benefits (snacks, stocked fridge) , salary at the higher end of the scale and have an impact on what you’re contributing as a designer, this might not be the place for you. If you just had a baby, bought a house, need stability or building your resume now is a good time. But the culture shift will catchup with the rumors as well as the numbers in the coming years.

No hard feelings, great time while I was there and wouldn’t change a thing. Easy finding an engaging mid 6 figure position elsewhere. Companies also match RSUs you might’ve lost out on. Mostly I miss the people and my team, but unfortunately losing faith in where the company is headed... I wouldn’t accept a position again considering the current climate within most major design orgs.

","Constant red tape to ge through if you want to do anything thanks to Corp.
Stressfully busy.
If you aren’t in sales or support on the floor, you are basically viewed as garbage. Your contributions outside of those behaviors are never enough.
Apple likes to get rid of roles and tell everyone it’s “retail evolution”.
Constant advancement of people into roles they don’t deserve while qualified applicants are passed over.
Don’t have strong opinions about things needing improvement because you’ll never be taken seriously since you aren’t soft-spoken and full of woo-woo love. Emotions are unacceptable.
Almost entire store management team are outside hires and favoritism is a real problem.
High-turnover whether management admits to it or not.

Gone are the days of making any meaningful connection with a customer, they've been replaced with endless wave after wave of marketing that can't be backed up with quality products. They need to sit down and do some serious soul searching.

2019-01-23, Specialist,"Portland, OR","Former Employee, more than 5 years","Stressful, yet dynamic and rewarding","— Apple does an outstanding job training and preparing retail employees.
— Apple truly cares about your development (both professional and personal) and gives you time to review and document experiences, goals, etc., while providing reading materials, tools to document learning and progression, and more.
— Great benefits.
— Ample breaks in an 8-hour shift.
— Pretty easy to get time off
","— Stressful work environment.
— Little control over schedule, e.g., you'll work weekends, nights)
— They tend to hire the same types of managers over and over again.
— Not enough breaks depending on shift length, e.g., 5 or 6 hour shift.
— Very challenging customers.
— Very little ability to move up to a management position.
— Stores are often super cold.

","Soul destroying. Was great at the start and even first and second year. Ended up being Tier 2. So if someone rang Apple and was upset or it was too technical for Tier 1 they would pass them to us. I didn’t want to get out of bed for most days. In another job now which is much less pay but I would never go back, money isn’t everything.

","Apple has a lot of departments and they don't all work the same way, so these comments apply to my own group (Customer Systems), not necessarily the company at large. Web tech is de-valued relative to mobile, modern standards and practices for front end are not valued highly. Generally, if you're not working on customer facing content, UI polish and performance is not prioritized. Confusing mish-mash of design standards. Documentation is not at a sufficiently high standard. My group uses a lot of offshore contractors, and they're really treated as second class to full time employees. This doesn't encourage the best performance and quality of work, but it saves the company money. Work-life balance is not prioritized.

2018-12-28, Technical Support,Cork,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",Lovely Place to Work - Not Suitable for All Though,"Work from home - can be very comforting to work in your own home office and not have the pressures or dress code. They supply all the equipment and reimburse internet bills
Health insurance, dental care, vision care
Employee discounts and friends & family discounts
Store credit issued every 3 years
Down to earth managers
Time allotted every week for self training
Easy job - 3 weeks of classroom training and another 2 weeks of easing into the role. After a month it's easy to settle in and if not, the help is always there from managers or senior advisors who are very approachable
","Working from home is also a con as well - the novelty can wear off after some time and it's not for everybody as it can get very lonely and isolating after a while. Especially if your struggling
Work is very metrics based, too focused on stats and numbers
Peer feedback system which people use and abuse to badmouth you to your manager simply if they didn't like you (although this will be taken into account by the manager whether to send the feedback to you or disregard it)
Work is repetitive, mostly calls
Can be very hard to book time off or get the shift you want. This is based on a bidding process which to be fair is a good motivator but even if you're doing great you can never get weekends off
Career opportunities if you don't work in cork are limited. You can progress up the management line but if you don't want to work in tech or in any customer facing role the opportunities simply aren't there
Advice to Management
Try to be more inclusive of work from home advisors, the job can be very isolating and makes it more difficult when you've no one around you. A simple catch up every now and then outside of scheduled meetings to see how we're doing personally and mentally can do the world of good for feeling like we're supported and motivated.

There is also a lot of opportunity for career advancement within the company. The positives definitely outweigh the negatives in this job though.
","As with every customer service job, you have to deal with some mean people over the phone but that is expected. Also, you have to submit a preferred schedule for work but it is not guaranteed that you get the schedule you desire. Being a college student in this position, getting a good schedule for your class load is of utmost priority. On top of that, I was not a fan of working during weekends but you have to work on Saturday or Sunday for this position.

","I am not paid on time due to inept managers. I'm always told they'll follow up with an ""IOU"" on the next paycheck. The government has to subsidize my income because Apple does not pay a living wage considering the high costs of living in my state. Because of the low wages the Apple pays, our family has to rely on food stamps. There is no way to obtain a second income because their ""shift bidding"" is so sporadic. Most opportunities at the company are lateral moves with no pay increase. It's telling when you cannot afford to purchase the products the company you work for produces.
Advice to Management
Apple is no longer innovative. Products are mediocre at best. Restricted stock units shouldn't replace a stable living wage and with the stock performing so poorly, it shouldn't even be considered compensation. Other companies, such as Target and Amazon, stepped up and increased their wages (27%). Most employees saw almost a $4.00 per hourly wage increase. Apple HR needs to stop using cost of labor as an excuse. It's embarrassing to be an employee.

- Customer support can be stressful at times and you want and need to develop in other positions

2018-12-26, Technical Specialist,,"Current Employee, less than 1 year","Team is great, Customers not so much","The team at my store was perhaps the most diverse and interesting group of people that I've ever met, and I would not have been able to meet people like them were it not for Apple. Everyone is willing to help you out when you've got a problem/dealing with some ambiguous situations so there should be little reason for feeling nervous or unsure about how the day is going go.

The employee benefits are fairly generous, with relatively large discounts on products for both yourself and friends+family. Apple will reimburse you up to a certain amount for fitness related expenses like a gym membership.

I managed to secure a fairly good work/life balance at Apple, however I'm not sure about others.

Probably good for the CV?
","Like in any customer service position, the customers are the most painful part of the job. Some difficult interactions would have been avoidable if AppleCare support and Apple stores were on the same page regarding things such as the availability of appointments and other specifics.

Managing customer expectations is also something that could be improved on within stores between sales and support, though management are always actively taking efforts to improve that.

The hourly rate is below market average.
Advice to Management
The most painful part about the job is dealing with customers who have either not been informed, or been misinformed about the support that we can provide. Both are very difficult issues to rectify, but if possible, it would greatly increase the smoothness of the customer experience.

*Aparently it “looks good on your CV”
","*Benefits don’t put bread on the table. Does not make up for the low wages for non-salaried staff 
*Financially stunted wages and “rises” (sun inflation for several years in a row)
*Glass ceiling - very little progression, specifically in retail stores
*Advocates equal pay for equal work but staff in same roles will be on different rates of pay 
*Inherent sexism (low percentage of females in “advanced” roles)
*Demands more than they are willing to give
*Poor work/life balance as they will not implement set shifts patterns

2018-12-13,Anonymous,"Sacramento, CA","Current Employee, more than 3 years",Amazing company to work with,"Working at Apple is a unique experience that will be like no other company. You work with some of the most amazing people who are talented in a wide range of talents. You learn so much from your team members you'll always utilize them as a resource and they soon become family. The culture here is definitely unique and coming from a commissioned background, as far as sales goes, cut-throat and vindictive behaviors aren't encouraged. Moving up and growing is fairly simple, work hard, build a good rapport, and your work should be noticed. The benefits are amazing: top of the line health, dental, and vision insurance, education and fitness reimbursements (if you work near or at a campus they typically have gyms on campus for roughly $5), medical consultation form Stanford University, 3rd party corporate discounts, RSU and ESPP (Employee Stock Purchase Program) and so much more! Every few months there's something called NPP (Net Promoter for out People) in which the company asks us for our feedback for things to implement change.
","Working in retail is tough. The leadership team can sometimes micromanage while not assuming positive intent which is frustrating. My local leadership team tells you ""you own your own development"" but give you no direction or coaching. When first starting with the company you get a lot of training for your role, but unfortunately no training around our company's amazing benefits and how to utilize them, and when it's time to use them you're typically scrambling to get a hold of your resources.

2018-12-13, Specialist,"Birmingham, England, England","Current Employee, less than 1 year",It’s a pleasure working for this company,"Everyday I’m excited to go to work knowing that I’ll be helping people, finding out new things about the various devices or just engaging with my colleagues.

The thing about Apple, it’s not designed to be a hard sell company. I don’t look to hard sell you the iPhone, in fact, Apple’s marketing should garner enough interest in you already, I just want to lead you to a place where you may/may not see an Apple product working well for you.

Let’s talk about support. Out of all the other consumer electronics manufacturer out there, who offers such a diverse support system, whether at home, out and about or even in a different country. I have the confidence that if something goes wrong with my phone or iPad or MacBook, I know who to go first.
","I have suspected that management can be a little off. Meaning some don’t have as enough technical expertise as I’d hoped, some lack in people skills and some you don’t see at all. 

In addition, they talk very well about reaching your full potential, but with that comes a game of favouritism. If they love you, they’ll put in good word, if not, well, you may as well just remain a specialist!
Advice to Management
Be proactive in employee engagement and development. There are some employees who have spoken to me about wanting to do something to build their character and have been shot down. I don’t want to have to do your own work. If it needs be, you step down and I’ll take your place.

2018-12-12, Technical Specialist,"Metairie, LA","Current Employee, more than 1 year","Best retail job, but not perfect.","Great overall environment with coworkers. Allowed for some individuality - both in wardrobe expression and daily operations.
","Dealing with customers is certainly a part of retail, but we get a lot of heat from customers from decisions that corporate makes. And then, most of the time, we give the customer what they want anyways. Not to say that's wrong, but it messes with the standards and adds to the ""other Apple Store does it"" argument.
Additionally, as a part time employee hours can range from 15-30 hours per week - at least that's what the paperwork says. I was getting scheduled for about 28 hours a week consistently while also in college. This was fine until I realized that my academics were suffering, so I went to my managers and asked to reduce my hours. I was denied that because ""there aren't enough people...we need you...we have to have everyone on deck for Saturdays and Sundays"". That's certainly fair, but I didn't believe it when I saw leave requests getting approved left and right and continuous callouts throughout the whole section going unstopped.
My biggest gripe was the lack of scheduling flexibility.
I heard that there was room to grow and experiment with different jobs, but never got to experience that as I eventually ended up having to quit after a long attempt to reduce hours.
When I started not ""meeting standards"" for my position, I asked to move to a different section. I was again denied by basically being told to ""just do better"" in all aspects of my life - even after I said that this job was affecting all aspects of my life negatively and I really thought that moving out of my section would be better for everyone.
Advice to Management
Actually try to find a solution that works for both the employee and the Store. This is a great company to work for - when you can meet their needs.

2018-12-12, Genius,"Philadelphia, PA","Current Employee, more than 5 years",See Past the Shiny Facade,"The benefits are absolutely stellar. Discounts are nice, and other companies offer great discounts on their products/services as well. Competitive pay to start.
","Work/life balance is god awful...I don't know when I'm working until 2 weeks ahead of time, and it can easily change without notice or justification. Taking time off is almost impossible unless it's requested months in advance, and even then it's still dodgy. The pay is quickly outpaced by other up and coming companies that also provide great benefits. Oh, and now new employees are starting off at higher pay than I made in my first six years at the company.
Advice to Management
Make it easier to take a day off. Don't lie to your staff. Stop spending so much money on different color t-shirts to wear on the floor. Pay your seasoned employees better.
