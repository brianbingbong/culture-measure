","It depends on the org and product area; some leadership teams are very biased and unreasonable and all they want is to take credit from your work and make themselves look good. They bad mouth about people who are NOT in their circle of trust and just want to get rid of them instead of helping them to grow. Horrible.
Advice to Management
Get rid of your arrogant PA/DS ladder executives. They don't know what they are talking about when it comes to building a healthy analyst community. All they want is to show how smart they are without understanding the real needs of the analysts who are below L7. Wake up! Or you will LOSE more people.

","Difficult to find a good role in the company.
- 75%+ (90%?) of projects are worthless/pointless & destined to go nowhere. On these projects, you can lead a team & the culture is typically good - but your work will never have a real impact.
- At most 25% of projects (probably less) have any chance of having much impact. On those projects, its very difficult to get a role as more than a cog. Also, those teams can afford to (and tend to) have a crappier culture & push people much harder because people want to work on them.
Most people end up working on things they aren't really interested in, or in roles they wouldn't take or stay-in at other companies.
Management quality varies *a lot*. I've seen some managers who were good at their job and also decent human beings. I've seen some that absolutely didn't deserve their roles, and/or that were vey sleazy. Google will basically always consider your manager to be correct in any dispute/disagreement with you, so a bad/sleazy manager can be very bad for your career at G.

2021-09-26, Staff Software Engineer,"Mountain View, CA","Current Employee, more than 10 years",Senior management cares only about creating good appearance of a healthy company,"- still lots of great & smart people to work with, but the numbers are dwindling
- *some* tech and dev infra is really cool and ahead of times
- company brand that still means a lot to many
","Lots of great people are leaving and being replaced by people that are very junior, or with senior people with values that didn't use to be common at Google.

Senior management is often more interested in just creating an appearance of a happy and healthy company, rather than actually solving some hard problems.

A lot of technical debt that is increasingly hard to address due to the scale of the company.

In spite of increasingly making more and more money, the management invests less and less back into the company and its employees.
Advice to Management
Add ""Don't be evil"" back to the corporate code of conduct. Revisit the company values. Invest heavily into the core infra and people that power the company.

2021-09-15, Financial Analyst,"Sunnyvale, CA","Former Employee, more than 5 years",Bad Promo Process and Mediocre Salary,"Google has an awesome company culture and perks. Culture: management is accessible, your voice can be heard at team meetings and even all-hands meetings, people respect you, and I always felt cared about as a person. Perks: I thoroughly enjoyed the free breakfast/lunch/dinner, baristas, gym, commuter bus, and subsidized massages.
","Google has to make some serious changes to improve its performance management and promotion processes. Called ""Perf"", it's a twice a year process that managers and staff alike despise because it takes up enormous amounts of time and results in questionable promotion decisions. 

In Finance, approximately 10% of the team can get promoted in any given Perf cycle and there are only two per year. I recommend learning about Google's internal level system during the hiring process and asking what level your role is before you accept the job offer. Talk to a friend or contact and see if the leveling of your role is reasonable to start with. I was hired at too low of a level and then slow (3 years) to reach my first promotion. 

Finance Levels at Google (rough work experience required):

L3 Financial Analyst (1-2 years)
L4 Financial Analyst (2-4 years)
L5 Senior Financial Analyst (4-6 years)
L6 Finance Manager (6-8 years)
L7 & L7.5 Senior Finance Manager (8+)
L8 Finance Director (12+)

L5 is the terminal level for many Finance employees. It's extremely difficult to get into management. L6 and above are very political promotions. For promotions at levels 3-5, they are largely time-based (2 years on average for L3/L4, 3 years for L5). Super strong performers do not get promoted more quickly, contrary to what Google claims. 

While total compensation (salary + 15% bonus + equity) is often competitive, the salary component is quite low and makes it hard to afford the SF Bay Area cost of living, especially in your first year before you get a bonus and before any of your equity vests.
Advice to Management
Higher base salaries, more roles outside of the SF Bay Area, and a more equitable/lightweight perf/promo process. Don't hire people at unfairly low levels. Example: Ivy League MBA graduate with 8 years of banking experience hired as an L4 Financial Analyst. Promote high performers at a pace much quicker than average. I've seen many good people leave because they were passed up for promotion too many times while working hard.

Heavy investment into diversity equity and inclusion.

Great work life balance and ability to shut work off to focus on your family. Great support across the organization for this.
","Each of the leaders operates in their own silo, this causes confusion, duplicate work, and no vision cross-organizationally.

There is a ton of red tape to get through to make even the smallest of change for the better.

The organization has a very anti sales culture.

There are some serious issues with the wage gap still at this organization between male and female workers.

2021-09-04, Engagement Manager,"München, Bavaria, Bavaria",Current Employee,Great place to work. Cloud is becoming a different company.,"Benefits
Collaborative atmosphere
Smart and driven colleges
Massive growth in Cloud and potential to shape.
","The Google Cloud part of the company is turning more and more into a very traditional B2B Enterprise company as the workforce has been grown aggressively through external hires from Oracle, SAP and Microsoft. Google's culture is much less present there, with more emphasis on hirarchy, 'sales culture' and politics compared to Google's traditional very entrepreneurial, hands-on and 'engineering culture'.

Still a good place to work with collaborative, smart and friendly coworkers. Just not necessarily how you would expect Google to be.

2021-09-03, Software Engineer,"Pittsburgh, PA","Former Employee, more than 3 years",Amazing if not for a fatal flaw.,"+) Extremely high compensation. When I switched to another big tech company, I actually ended up taking a small paycut despite getting a promotion.
+) Very flexible working hours (I had a coworker who worked four ten hour days and took Fridays off)
+) Excellent perks. Free food for three meals a day (of very good quality) plus snacks, and plenty of ""teambuilding"" events that are basically excuses to enjoy an afternoon off with coworkers.
+) A few years working at Google will make your resume and let you join pretty much any company you choose.
","-) Extremely political. Google is all about bringing your whole self to work, so long as your whole self is progressive. There are a number of activists within the company who will protest at the drop of a hat. This may be a positive for some people, but anyone on the right, or even in the center of the political spectrum will have to bite their tongue to remain employed. 
-) Getting promoted within the company is a difficult ordeal, and the effort may not match the results.
Advice to Management
I'd say to focus on work, not activism, but it's probably too late. I fully expect activists to claim more and more control within the company, and for Google's mission to fully slide into social justice, as opposed to making good products for customers.

2021-08-27, Senior SRE,"Dublin, Dublin",Current Employee,A Big Company that pretends it's a Startup,"Amazing tech, excellent benefits, a very generous employer. Salaries are not top of the line, but certainly high; office amenities are well documented; there are various budgets and stipends for training and learning; out of hours on-call times get (some) time off in lieu.
","Many policies are enforced unevenly, the dismissal of various ""troublemakers"" have made the news and should be reviewed carefully. There is a significant amount of gaslighting and straight up dishonesty about policies, especially around topics where it is easy to be vague such as communications and confidentiality.

The positives above only apply to Engineering teams. Life is very different in Sales, I am told. 

While there are many claims about ""we're a family"" and ""community"" and so on, there is the usual strong disconnect between senior and exec management and the individual contributors at the coalface. This is expected in a huge company, but as it fails to admit that it is a huge company, it takes no steps to correct this.

Be more competitive on pay and work on proper leveling. Also, when you acquire a company. Don't take so long to work on properly integrating the company. It especially makes it hard to transition to any other team in Google when you've never touched any of the tools.

","Hired too many senior leaders with questionable moral compasses, ignored the fact that their technical lead in many areas was rapidly declining, became arrogant in their success, refused to acknowledge that the exodus of many mid-level leaders indicated a big problem
Advice to Management
Google is broken. Seriously, stop assuming you're the leader. You're not anymore (except in a few isolated cases, and even then it's not huge). Get back to ethics and making the world better. Stop hiring people with more salesmanship than morals.

This department uses data to take a proactive approach to ensure the happiness of employees. For instance, when Google noticed a higher turnaround rate for women, they looked at data and noticed most were new mothers, which led to the implenetation of a generous maternity leave policy.
","Many modern American companies have developed a contrived culture of lingering at work. Ambitious, new or young talent may end up hanging out at the office outside of work hours, often working or learning. This can develop into peer pressure to spend a lot of time at the office.

","It can take a really long time for senior leaders to make a decision because it's such a big company and you are rewarded for steering the ship slowly and safely, not for risk-taking.

Boredom. Those office convos? Kinda missing Susan’s cat stories, eh? How long can you go without seeing another living human being?
Working slowly. Sometimes the office has an energy. Sometimes your home does not.
No second monitor. How did I ever work without two giant screens looming above me??? All 74 of my tabs are essential!
Iffy WiFi. At home or in a cafe, when the wifi start to spaz and you switch locations a couple of times but honestly spend more time parking and ordering a 6-shot mint mojito coffee with coconut milk and 16 grains of sugar than doing work.

2021-07-19, Account Manager,"Dublin, Dublin","Current Employee, more than 3 years",Simply the best,"There's a reason why the company is known as being the best of the best. Genuine interest in work/life balance; takes feedback from employees; no micro management; perks are the best of any employer. Free breakfast, lunch and dinner if you want it. Multiple professional baristas on site for expertly brewed coffee; snack and drinks cupboards on every floor in the office; gym and swimming pool and classes on site. Massages, even a hairdresser and post office and bank in the office! At the end of every year you get a salary review/increase and a stock refresh. Management and fellow employees are all unbelievably talented and wonderful colleagues who are keen to lift and support each other.
","Can be slow to get promoted and progress up the company. Upward mobility is hard.
Advice to Management
Continue promoting from within; focus on your current existing employees rather than driving a huge focus on external recruitment. You have an unbelievably talented workforce - focus on them!

2021-07-18,Anonymous,"San Francisco, CA","Current Employee, more than 3 years","Prestigious, fascinating, great benefits but EXHAUSTING and poor work/life balance","It's GOOGLE. Great benefits, probably the most stable OTE pay for a sales role EVER, perks galore, and the chance to develop yourself and shape your career path with the world's greatest resources.
","Despite the perks and the prestigious logo, work/life balance is poor. Google is filled to the brim with over-achievers always intent on promo or their next role. This, along with an INSATIABLE demand for growth, leads to unhealthy work/life balance. My teammates and I regularly burnout and get sick from exhaustion. Management knows about this and still lacks compassion. Instead of truly ""seeing you,"" they say something like ""working hard doesn't mean you are working smart."" This sentiment hurts, especially when mgmt is constantly throwing you last-minute AIs and adding new OKRs/KPIs.
Advice to Management
Your employees give their lives to Google: respect that more and meet employees where they are at. LISTEN/be curious about work/life balance struggles, understand that burnout is becoming more acute as the pandemic keeps going. Please revisit your ""Return to Office"" policy and comms, which created a tsunami of fear and anxiety across the company. You've got plenty of money and resources to up morale. Even a little something would mean a lot.

","It almost feels like a cult full of toxic positivity. The work culture is quite unhealthy - some people are in the office as early as 6 am and leave as late as 10 pm to hit their targets. Targets are often set at unattainable levels that require this kind of time commitment. They also emphasize “culture fit” in the hiring process, but if you start in sales and would like to move to something more gratifying that you would experience more success in, it’s nearly impossible. All that matters is how much money you make them.

2021-07-06, Customer Solutions Engineer,"London, England, England","Former Employee, more than 1 year",Avoid at all costs,"Google will throw perks at you as a way to make you stay; the food is great (outside of MTV), the offices are beautiful and there's a lot of smart people to work with.
","I don't even know where to start.

Internal mobility sucks: the ladder transfer process is extremely bureaucratic; depending on your current role, hiring managers won't even reply to your email; you need to know the right people to get the job, otherwise you'll keep hitting the wall. 
That said, if you ever hear ""gTech"", run like the devil runs from the cross. One of the luring tactics they'll use to get you to enter gTech is to say moving internally is a real possibility -- except that gTech hires engineers to sales support roles, and other orgs at Google don't give a gTech engineer any credit (because we have nothing to show for our work, which is not technical, not interesting, not relevant). I was naive enough to believe the job description, which sounded actually interesting, just to start in a role that led me to depression and undermined my coding skills, because my main task (when I wasn't in useless meetings) was archiving emails.
Don't do that to yourself. If you want to be a Software Engineer at Google, postpone your application and study for an actual SWE role. Don't join gTech thinking it opens doors, because it actually closed them.

Now, for those who care about Diversity, Equity and Inclusion: Google doesn't. Of course, the image we get is that everything is a shining rainbow of happiness, inclusivity and cooperation, but if you speak up about things that actually matter, they will make you shut up. The louder you are, the bigger the consequences. Google is mostly made of privileged demographics that couldn't care less about any event or initiative about DEI internally. What ends up happening is that the underrepresented people end up getting yet another expectation of DEI champion, and that will only slow down their progress, productivity and, ultimately, compensation and career progression.

Overall: the food is great, but it's not worth the trouble 👍

2021-06-28, SMB Account Manager ,Amsterdam,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",Googleyness is real,"Please note that I am working for Google Cloud which is a pretty independent unit within the greater Google.

- Very smart and creative but humble people, you won't find the brashness and blabla that are seen in corporate environmnets too often
- High level of trust, no micro-management, managers are subject matter experts and not just ""managers
- Employees are entrusted with big responsibilities from an early point on and encouraged to take on projects that go beyond the usual scope of the core job 
- Possibility of taking on a 20% project which does not even need to be connected to core job
- Techy, data driven, nerdy, quirky culture
- Great technology + GCP is getting more and more successful particularly among startups/ tech companies
- Intriguing environment, just check things like ""Talks at Google"" on YouTube
- Great benefits, salary, stock options
","- Google Cloud, particularly in the startup/ SMB segment feels a bit like startup itself which also means chaotic at times - Many processes aren't well defined
- Too many complex, self built tools 
- Google is quite insistent on hiring in Dublin, particularly in Cloud SMB. This will need to change since Dublin is an objectively less attractive city than say Amsterdam or Berlin
Advice to Management
Abandon the concept of Dublin as a hub.
Especially since Covid it is perceived even less favourably by people and people are even less willing to relocate there for a job.
If you keep hiring in Dublin instead of offering more remote, in-country positions or positions at local offices such as Amsterdam, the pool of talent to pick from will be small and the quality of our poeple will go down

There is a great work atmosphere in the campus. The work-life balance is amazing as well - no one bothers you after 5pm or on weekends. There is nothing I could say bad about Google culture.
","The situation seems a bit too relaxed at times. There are people who seem too comfortable in their roles. Several orgs within Google could use some hunger/fire in what they do. Senior management is not impressive. Colleagues are.

2021-06-18, Software Engineer,"Seattle, WA","Current Employee, less than 1 year",Prepare to be pampered,"1. Work with some of the very smartest people in the industry.
2. Perks on perks, endless perks, you won't even be able to find them all on the public internet, prepare to be pampered daily.
3. Some of the coolest tech offices in the world. And you can visit any of them at any time if you happen to be stopping by! (Not right now because of COVID, obviously)
4. Quite possibly the best internal tools in FAANG.
5. Stock is a rocketship right now.
6. Get first-hand insight on some really cool and cutting-edge projects. Although unfortunately, you won't always be allowed to talk about them externally.
7. On average, great WLB (30-40 hrs/wk). But as with any company, it's entirely team-dependent, so do your research before joining a team!
","1. Pay is not as crazy as it was, say in 2010. (But still among the top in the industry)
2. Still some uncertainty around WFH policy.
3. Some of the projects are really cool but might never see the light of day. Just how big tech is though, sometimes.
Advice to Management
Take a clearer stance on WFH policy, one way or the other.

2021-06-18, ITRP (Internal Technology Residency Program),"Mountain View, CA","Former Employee, more than 1 year","If the guy who threatened my job could get promoted, this is not the place where I want to work.","The pay was decent for the bay.
Lots of amazing people, got to meet and see all kinds of cool people. 
Got to travel
Occasional perks made some things nicer, but they were often ephemeral. 
FTE status for extra perks sometimes.
","Too much to complain about. I deleted a lot that would have probably identified me. 

My first manager threatened my job in a private meeting. Told me other managers were gossiping about me. He told me my job was in danger if I kept submitting negative feedback about his (eventually proven to be bad) idea. I communicated that the expectations set when I started were being abandoned. I told him how my last job they hired me away from stuck to their expectations at least, and he told me to go back to my old job. 

Another manager, in a small meeting of himself and some ITRs did it to a group of people once too. ""Remember, we're the ones who sign your conversion papers"". I didn't feel secure and was often anxious around management, because I never knew who was gossiping about me and who wasn't. 

How would you react to this kind of hostility? I was too afraid to report him, so I watched him get promoted away from his mistakes and failed responsibilities. I was mentorless, directionless, and the guy who I thought was looking out for me was just looking out for himself. 

This kind of trash happened more than once, and the managers should be ashamed of themselves for starting cliques and discouraging honest, candid feedback. 

This program was not googly, and this is not the only reason.
Advice to Management
It feels like upper management advocated for managers' interests more than ITRs, and didn't chime-in enough to help us when other departments demanded more from us. We got steamrolled and it was almost always one-sided.

Sometimes decisions are made a certain way simply because it is easier not because it is the best way forward. In the system infrastructure team, it is hard to make impact because of the massive change it takes to alter things even slightly.

Ease up on the sales process stuff and let the sales teams do their work. Bonuses are paid based on quota attainment, but for some reason, perf is all about people and process.

2021-06-10, Director,"London, England, England","Current Employee, more than 1 year",brilliant and horrendous at the same time,"great people, smart, friendly, helpful, ambitious, motivated colleagues, very interesting work, superb compensation and general employee package.
","long serving leadership (loads of people who’ve been there for 14+ years) have lost sight of the outside world and have a very over blown sense of their own importance! 
the company is absolute chaos, everything overlaps, no one is sure who does what, everyone competes hard to be seen as the winner
it’s very siloed, all the different bits of google run as pretty separate companies so for anyone or team in roles that have to deal with more than one of the engineering groups, it is very hard to get them to work together.

Pros
Overall, Google is a nice place to work. There's a high concentration of smart people and loads of interesting things going on.
Cons
Avoid 'gTech' at all costs, especially as an engineer.. It's a highly political and dysfunctional org where everything is about ""helping"" customers or sales (never with anything interesting though) and making up bs metrics about what you've done. 

They'll lure you in with all the benefits of working at Google and the promise to work on exciting things. Don't let them fool you, the actual work is mind numbing and the culture is terrible. gTech is easily the worst place to be in Google and you'll regret joining within a year. Attrition is very high and internal transfers to a decent org are hard, so most people leave pretty soon.
Advice to Management
Consider how the gTech org is bringing your brand down.

","Very bay area centric so high earnings don't go nearly as far if you want to be where most things are happening in the company.
Often hard to feel impact, especially if working deep in back end systems, or systems you're not very excited about.

Fix the perf system so that it rewards collaboration and doesn’t foster individualism and “ownership” that can translate into idea stealing.

There are very few bad apples and most people who work there are pretty smart. The engineering culture is solid. You can move around fairly easily. Promotion (at least at the basic levels) is fair.
","The job is a little boring. A lot of what made it famous early on -- 20% time, for instance, and real transparency from leadership, to name two such things -- have withered away as the company has grown to its current global status. It's a big company with a lot of bureaucracy. There's a lot of red tape and approvals to go through nowadays. No one at Google today is creating the next Gmail in their free time.

2021-05-08, Software Engineer II,"Redmond, WA",Current Employee,Rushed out the Door,"Free food, nice offices, resources for mental health that you'll probably need after working there for a while.
","In my experience the focus has been on rushing something out the door. Not necessarily something good, or something completely functional (even for the minimal features in the MVP), just something. Frequently software is rushed, testing is skimped on, and higher up engineers are unwilling to learn modern software development practices to improve software performance, reliability, developer experience, and user experience.

If you do not like to cut corners, do not work at Google. After spending 4 years here, being told by 3 managers that I care too much about my work and spend too much time making it right (while simultaneously being dinged on perf for it being 'not right enough'), and witnessing Google's willingness to protect sexual abusers and the bottom line over its purported values, the veneer of friendliness seems very disingenuous.

","Google Shopping (formerly Express) was quite the hot mess, essentially an immature, messy start-up despite being a part of the larger Alphabet family. No clear vision or direction, more like 'let's throw stuff on the wall and see what sticks.'

Very frustrating experience to be a part of -- unrealistic work loads on the shoulders of a few, constant clashing between different groups that were supposed to be collaborative and working towards the same goal (i.e. the customer). Very hard to make data-driven decisions for the customer with constant bullying and micro-aggressions from the Category Management team to push their specific agenda (i.e. revenue goals and merchant favoritism).

A constant revolving door of contractors who did the majority of the work, who were under constant pressure, overworked, and under-appreciated and under-valued. Direct management of such contractors couldn't even be bothered to manage, engage, or acknowledge these extended workforce folks.
Advice to Management
Doesn't really matter anymore since almost all of Shopping was cut/let go, redistributed, or left...because it was a FAILURE. 

But essentially it's pretty clear that when you stray from your core mission and values, you all but guarantee failure. Also not hiring people who actually had eCommerce/retail experience didn't help either. Another prime example of mediocre people milking the company and never really get evaluated or held accountable for results. Instead they just get shuffled around, delegating busy work to others, all while cashing in their checks. Alphabet may be huge and making huge profits, but you still gotta trim the fat and cut out dead weight.

2021-04-27, Product Strategy Lead,"New York, NY",Current Employee,Great place to grow and learn steadily in your middle to late career,"Benefits and perks are industry-leading, and work culture is very conducive to separating work and life. I feel supported by the policies and management expectations that are put in place to encourage wellness, honest feedback, and time off when necessary. The average tenure of a Googler seems longer than the average big-tech (ex-FB), and I think that's due to the long-term mobility you can find here - whether it's across business units, movement to XFN teams, and even to new markets/offices.
","Very large and ever-growing company creates a lot of product and workstream silos, potential for overlap, and definitely an incredibly heavy consensus-driven culture. Working here teaches you to collaborate and manage internal stakeholders, but this comes at the expense (sometimes) of moving quickly and feeling autonomous.

- Great learning opportunities as you can virtually sign up to learn anything internally as Google has many different teams/orgs/functions.
","Given the size of the company, it might be tough to tie your work to the impact you are making. If ""what"" you do matters and if you are not passionate about advertising, it can be tough to grow further. Additionally, each team/org has their drawback, whether it is an excessive focus on metrics/target, or how you need to manage upward to get further in the corporate ladder (but one can argue that you need that skill anywhere in life).

Business Outlook
Pros
My favorite thing about working at Google is the people you work alongside. Everyone I have ever worked with at Google is an intelligent, hard working, and overall kind person. The work environment is also fast paced, ambiguous, innovative and rewarding. The company has a great culture overall and a lot of opportunity for learning and growth.
Cons
It can be difficult to land a role in your location of preference due to high competition and focus on specific hub offices. In addition, job mobility can be harder when you are in business and non-Eng roles. Most positions are also located in expensive cities which may not work as well for people further in their career with greater preference and limitation on where they are willing to live.

Advice to Management
Re-evaluate your workloads against the average rate of burnout.
Re-evaluate how much revenue or how many clients managed per person is ""necessary"", and then lower this target.
Don't perpetuate work cultures where workaholism is implicitly or explicitly championed as the 'normal' worker state.
Even the workaholics are showing signs of burnout!
Encourage your product & policy leadership teams to proactively anticipate, respond to and solve for problems, before they snowball into much larger problems that create massive side-effects and productivity drains for other teams (especially client-facing teams).
Be more proactively transparent internally about ethical challenges facing Google, so we hear about them from leadership before we read about them in the media.
Continue taking employee feedback to heart and making significant changes based on that feedback -- don't stop at reminding employees that you are listening -- show demonstrable improvements & beneficial actions, AFTER they have been achieved.

While you're working at google, you can trust that your benefits are nearly as good as they get, and your salary is probably about 80% as good as it gets.
","People who are fresh out of college, or maybe have been at Google too long, forget what other jobs in the field are like. The reference for comparison can be very skewed. At the same time, management can talk a big game about the culture that google has, but rarely lives up to the promises of transparency, and innovative thinking, etc. But it's such a big company, I'm sure this is all department by department, team by team.

","Extreme competition among engineers (expect being compared with people doing overtime to get promoted). Substandard designers, managers are just promoted engineers (so ""manage yourself, I want to code""), custom tech for everything (so most of stuff you learn there you will never use again). Also you feel like playing a game: rules are highly artificial, people are ""mastering strategies"" to get ahead, nobody really cares about product. When you get in, learn the rules from someone who works there for 4+ years, and don't trust common sense.

","Your happiness depends on which org or team you're in. Some teams are great and healthy with solid engineering practices and priorities. Others are managed top-down, driven by money and deadlines. Your work-life balance will vary depending on this. Also frontend tech is slightly behind the leading edge.

2021-03-31, Associate Account Strategist,"Dublin, Dublin","Current Employee, more than 3 years",Do not join Google in this role,"-everything related to Google and not related to this role or the GCS org
","Summary: it's not what it used to be anymore

-calling client's that don't want to talk to you and convincing them to do things that are often not needed for them but for Google to generate more money
-learning curve flattens extremley after 3-6 months. After that, just a very well paid call-center job
-no clear career/growth path. Google keeps enforcing level (promo) requirements that force you to do a job that could be done by a computer for 2 years. 2 years ago, you would only have to do that for one quarter. Back in the old days, you would do 20% projects with other teams to get out of GCS. But this becomes harder and harder as most people know how terrible the GCS Org/Job is and simply leave after a short time. It's also very hard to learn any transferable skills as all you do is call people and convince them to stuff (no brain power needed) 
-higher management in central Europe does not have a clear strategy. Feels more like they try to push their own promo as hard as possible. Also, they block any rotation that would help you to get out of GCS to more interesting roles
-Higher management in central Europe always says stuff like ""we put you and your career first"" - which only applies to the sales roles that almost no one wants to do for a long period of time 
-The level you will be joining on (l2) in GCS is so low that you can't even change to (almost) any other department before a promotion. Even after a promotion, your level is often too low. You are stuck in this role for 2 years + 1-2 years on the next level before you can do anything interesting 
-A location that almost no one likes. That's why they hire local irish people for higher management to enforce the location
Advice to Management
-Vendorize Scaled & Engage, only focus on MMS
-Do not treat Bachelor and Master students the same way. Hire Bachelor on L2 and Master on L3. 
-See GCS as what it is: an entry to Google of high skilled people. Do not force people to stay in this org 
-Realize that Google is no longer the best employer in the market. Treat employees fairly, tell them what the job is like during the interviews

- No real internal promotion or career support
- No specialist track so people have to become people managers to progress, hence middle management is very poor and managers aren't concerned about the careers of the people they're managing

- Highly political culture -everything is done with promotion in mind, people treat work like a game of chess here. Doing your job is not enough (I once sat in a training where we were told explicitly that ""consistently meets expectations"" on a performance review was not an acceptable rating). This approach leads to burnout and some drama within teams.
Advice to Management
Hire more senior leaders with emotional intelligence. If you are only interested in the bottom line, your core values will erode over time and you will lose all the values that made Google such a remarkable company in the first place.

Advice to Management
The only advice I can provide to management is to actually self reflect on what they are doing. Managers are too focused on their own performance and what they can ""contribute"" to the organisation, creating an extremely toxic and competitive environment between themselves. Also there needs to be less reactive and more proactive initiatives. Nothing innovative; new or progressed during my time in the residency program.

Humble yourselves, listen to your staff and actually start acting appropriately. A plethora of managers were in the mindset of ""They are only here for 20-26 months, the problem will go away"". Do something out of the box, go against the grain, grow a spine and actually spearhead change.

The disparity between locations around the world was unfathomable. It is literally a roll of the dice whether you will have a good experience in the program based on the manager you were assigned to. I was extremely fortunate to have a fantastic supporting manager but my counterparts had a very different experience.

The director is not fit for their role. They hide behind their curtain making communication almost impossible. During all hands they were always stammering and choking on questions...the organisation needs a confident person at the helm that is able to answer questions without hesitation. The lack of strong leadership and direction always harmed morale.

2021-02-16, Children's Center Teacher II,"Mountain View, CA","Former Employee, more than 1 year","interesting preschool environment, typical lack of appreciation for educators","- work at a tech company and enjoy most of the benefits (if you can work It into your schedule)
- freedom in day to day work (*very team dependent)
- health insurance
","- very low pay for the area - my recruiter literally told me my offer was considered ""below a livable wage in the bay area"", however I also had no room to negotiate based on experience ..lesson learned!
- unfair / biased hiring practices - theres at least one lawsuit in recent years alleging unequal pay between male and female teachers. I can confirm I knew of at least 1 male teacher who was hired as a level II when every female teacher I knew had been told by their recruiter they *must* start as a level I regardless of education or experience. I knew of at least one peer with a Masters who had to start as a level I - $16/hr. I am confident the male teacher did not have the same level of experience.
- unfair promotions - all about who you are friends with. if your team is a sinking ship you will likely go down with them at performance time regardless of your own individual performance
- HIGH attrition due to all of the above. constantly understaffed and making huge crazy sacrifices to stay in ratio 
- used to give stock options at hire - took them away without telling the population. huge uproar when everyone found out, followed by walk out protest and calls for raising base pay based on market standards. told by google leadership ""we know educators being underpaid is a problem, but Google is not going to focus on that right now""
- few growth opportunities - only 3 levels of teacher when I was there in 2017, otherwise like a handful of operations and leadership positions. 
- base pay is bad but promotion compensation was worse, a slap in the face. when I was promoted from a level I to level II teacher (the 2nd of 3 levels I could aspire to, remember) my raise was literally less than a dollar + a few stock thank god, and my manager actually acted like It was a big deal. I cant really blame her, knowing now how some companies manage promotions and $$ when It comes down to It, but that was just insulting..for the both of us. not unusual for educators, especially in preschool, but Google sets their own standard high and when a company is always preaching how ""employee first"" they are you kind of get to hold them accountable to it in practice.
Advice to Management
advocate better for your teachers. you have all the power and they are doing all the dirty work. show up for them first - with parents, with google & the compensation team or internal mobility team. Treat them just as well - no *better* - than they treat the kids. Focus on why you are losing people, listen to their experiences, and find solid solutions for them. Put people with actual people management skills in leadership roles.

2021-02-03, Software Engineering Director,"Mountain View, CA","Current Employee, more than 10 years","Google is an amazing place to work for the people, the growth, scale, variety and perks!","-) The people (coworkers are smart & nice). 
-) The growth (you willl get invaluable development feedback from 360 degree reviews, that, if you are able to internalize and incorporate the feedback, will propel your career forward)
-) Variety. So many groups in one place, that when you're ready for your next career exploration, it will be easy and smooth. Google wants to be the last place you'll ever work.
-) Scale. If you want to have lots of users, in some cases billions, Google is a lot of fun and you are helping many people who use your product directly or indirectly. 
-) Free food and stocked ""micro-kitchens"" with snacks. And, the shuttles (okay, in 2020-21 this isn't a factor, but it will be when we all go back.)
Help the environment and make friends with neighbors, while riding a climate controlled bus with leather seats and friendly bus drivers, to work & back. If you can read in cars, you also will probably be able to get all your email done on the way to and from work, and the day is just about getting real work done.
","It is a large company, with over 100,000 employees, so there are often many people involved in any given project. You will need to be patient to work with stakeholders. Most teams have minimal politics so this goes smoothly. Things take longer than in a startup, but on the other hand, the scale of users, products, infrastructure is much greater.

-Nice people for the most part.
-Benefits and perks.
","-Most employees are miserable. The golden handcuffs keep people there.
-Diversity and inclusion are just buzz words. They have no clue how to achieve either.
-If you speak up about inequality too much or too loudly they will find ways to push you out. Creating a culture of gaslighting, discrimination and structurally reinforced racism.
-Many employees are suffering in silence as a result.
-Most of the leadership have sold their souls for a paycheck.

Stop paying your pr machines to push out information about all the “significant ways” you’re trying to make the company more diverse and inclusive, instead focus on dismantling all the systems that contribute to creating a toxic place for anyone that’s not white or Asian and male.

2021-02-02, Associate Account Strategist,"Redwood City, CA","Current Employee, more than 1 year",Foot In Door To Google,"You get to work with intelligent (socially and book smart) people constantly whether they are your customers or your coworkers. You don’t have to know Google Ads to start the role and they train you in the product very well. By a year in the role you’ll be in the 95% percentile of Google ads experts and you’ll have the opportunity to explore other roles at Google if you please. If you do well your pay goes through yearly refreshes and It can make a huge difference. You get to bring your whole self to work and that’s really cool.
","If you are joining the role from another company It is very vague if you will come into the role as an L2 (hourly) or L3 and that can make a big difference in compensation. People with 2-3 years of experience can make the same as a college grad and that can be frustrating. While pay has the potential to go up if you perform well, promotions can feel slow due to only 2 cycles a year which can limit you from going to roles that require certain levels. You will be challenged and need to have discipline, but it’s not a cutthroat environment in the slightest everyone helps everyone.

* The business model allows for the company to provide outstanding free services (gmail, calendar, maps, etc)
* It is on you to prove yourself for promotion (also a con) which means that managers don't unilaterally decide who should get promoted based on biases and favoritism.
","* The employees have grown to expect to continue to be treated extremely well (pay, benefits, and perks).
* It is on you to prove yourself for promotion (also a pro) which leads to a ""do what makes you look good, not do what is good"" perspective.

- monetarily this is a great place to be a UXR. If you are good, you can expect a good pay trajectory. Great benefits & perks.
- lots of stability
","- experience varies a LOT depending on the team & product
- If you like speed, this is not the place for you. Things are slow unless you are in a new bet area. 
- career growth is gradual..there are steps & you usually don't jump levels. (This can be a pro if you want to have slow & sustainable growth)

2021-01-13, Account Manager,"Dublin, Dublin","Current Employee, more than 1 year",The job is really not that interesting |The company really cares,"- Perks are great and you will use them (gym, food, pantry, education, insurance, dental, ...)
- Working for a big company logo helps to open doors and makes you ''an interesting'' person in the room
- In the right team and with the right portfolio, you can make a real difference to businesses and communities
- Very empathetic, inclusive, and open environment
- Job safety. If you do your job, are on time, do what you're asked, it's a road to retirement

Generally, I'd recommend this job to someone in their mid-20s looking for a career in one company with a lot of resources, or an older individual with less drive looking for a safe place.
","- Some roles are really not as glamorous as the job description reads. In customer-facing roles, you will often find yourself being an extended arm of Customer Support filing tickets and following up
- Getting a promotion is a steep challenge and fairly political (You have to be visible to the directors and sign up for all kinds of projects to show your value. This isn't much of an issue to me personally, but many people view it as an unwanted obstacle).
- You have to master your calendar to have time to actually do a job you want to do (After filing tickets, attending a dozen training sessions, taking multiple internal meetings a day, and replying to your emails, there are days when you find yourself having only 2-3 hours to do the job you hoped to be doing when they hired you)
- Inter-office transfers are very difficult to accomplish
- Irish tax system isn't really income-friendly (for those coming from low-income tax countries, you'd be shocked with how much money is lost every month).

Generally, I'd recommend dynamic, hungry, and entrepreneurial people to consider a smaller scale company where feel like you're making a difference, you mean something and your work is tangible, and not just a digit in Google's multi-billion dollar revenue.

Don't allow engineers to tank PM's performance reviews. Remove ""complexity"" from perf as a requirement because not everything needs to be as complicated as it is. Unnecessary complexity is why a lot of our stuff is unstable and slow (eg android and assistant)

","When high speed growth is hard to achieve, managers are trying to grab cakes from each other. One way to do that is more and more non-sense projects. On the other hand, nobody really cares about the so-called moon shot projects, as they are doomed to fail due to either poor judgement initially or short patience in execution.

We really should have Elon Musk as our CEO after Larry quit. I believe we would have set feet on Mars already. LOL

- lots and lots of possible stuff to work on internally, bc google really does Everything
- the perks + good job stability
- good work life balance; my workload is totally manageable
- cool to work on stuff that so many people use
","- the company (and codebase) is so big it will swallow you whole if you are not careful
- getting promoted / ""growing"" in your career is a big corporate game which feels slimy at times, to me 
- takes forever to launch anything. sometimes you will work for months and months at a time on something and the project will get cancelled. it's fine when this happens once but when it happens several times in a row it can be disheartening
- the culture of your specific team & manager kind of defines your experience
- can feel like a cog in the machine

2021-01-05, Software Engineer,"Boulder, CO","Current Employee, more than 1 year","Overall good work environment, highly team dependent though","Google is well known for its perks. In non-covid times the offices are well equipped, all the snacks, food, gyms, massage rooms, nap pods. It's the stuff of much satire. It's very nice.

The compensation is really good. Collaboration across teams can be great, although it does depend on product area. The culture in the company and much of the scandal that comes out is born out of transparency and freedom. Freedom to express yourself many employers stomp down on and sometimes.... it's too much but usually it's quite freeing.
","The promotion process at google is well intentioned but poor, IMO. It is honestly probably the single biggest reason google is known for abandoning products. We develop things for promotions because that's what gets them. Maintaining and improving or spending the energy to rebuild and transfer data doesnt get you a promotion.

You need to land something, but you also need to excel for over a year this dissuades people pushing to do something to try and get a promotion which is good but also disincentivizing. The whole thing is political, you need to land grab at times to get work other teams might be doing so they can't do it.... again so you can get promoted. If you land in the right place at the right time it is easy to move up, rising tides raise all ships. A bad manager, a bad product idea, can sink you even if you are doing good work.

Advice to Management
I would advise, holding employees accountable who are not meeting the expectations or standards. Many dependable employees are burning out because they have had to pick up the work of others not performing. I believe it is finding a balance of addressing performance and mental health.

2020-12-16, Associate Account Strategist,"San Francisco, CA","Current Employee, less than 1 year",Great Launchpad to Senior Strategy Roles,"Gain experience generating millions of dollars and managing tens of millions more. Alumni from other parts of Alphabet come speak all the time, so internal transfers are pretty transparent. It's Google, so benefits are top of the top. Free gourmet food that changes every day (with some popular staples), free dessert, free barista-made coffee, free snacks. And that's just the food, not to mention free gym, free rock climbing walls, free Ayco (Goldman Sachs) financial advice, free massages, etc. Plus, the people are super quirky, getting to know any one of them is so fascinating. There's always something that sticks out, like ""oh! that's their special quirk"". I remember my first day meeting people that came to Google from producing Emmy award-winning shows, are related to people that founded a literal sport, or have been to all continents. Google is full of incredibly smart people with interesting stories to tell.
","There are a crazy amount of benefits that its hard to keep track of. The main ones are listed and obvious but some more niche ones, or office-specific perks (like the free Lime scooters for some locations) are harder to find unless you spot the email. Maybe its more of a west coast office thing, but people are very easy going. I kind of wish it were a bit more competitive and people would flex more. I'm proud of the work people are doing but they gotta speak up!

Advice to Management
One-sided conversations, mixed messages and wordy documents are problems.

The frequency and depth of the review process may vary by company based on company size and goals of the evaluations.

This quarterly performance review example has sections for both achievements and areas of improvement. It also has a section for core values, as this must be a key performance indicator at this company. Different companies will have different measuring sticks for success.


To conduct an effective performance review, it’s important to deliver a positive and solution-focused message. This will be less discouraging to the employee.

This performance review example shows how you can offer constructive feedback, while also praising the employee’s efforts. The majority of the sections focus on the employees’ achievements and strengths.

 

It should come at no surprise that our leadership team spends a considerable amount of tim each quarter conducting performance review.

Make it clear at the beginning of a new hire’s employment how and when employees will be evaluated. This should be part of your onboarding process and is especially important if you’re managing a remote team.
Allow employees to prepare for their review by completing a self-assessment prior to their appraisal, then allow the employee to walk their manager through the reasoning behind their self-assessment.
Deliver a positive and solution-focused message (whenever possible), this will result in a less discouraging message.

2020-12-09, Software Engineer,"Zürich, Zürich","Former Employee, more than 3 years",Great technological company marred by bureaucracy and politics,"Salary might be high and various perks are nice. Depends a lot on the country / office you are in, though. A lot of smart people, computational resources and great (even if proprietary) tools for everything. The company carries the whole burden of your relocation. You have the ability to somewhat easily find a different project when you want and to move to that different team if you have spent 1-1.5 years on your current one. A lot of various projects to choose from.

If you are not a white heterosexual male, you get special attention from recruiters, also numerous internal support and career mentoring resources are at your disposal, so the company might be a good choice in that case.
","Depending on the project and the team you might feel inefficient of even irrelevant due to projects being huge, old and slow. Despite all the talks about fighting biases etc, your future to a high degree depends on your manager, who is often a great engineer, but with the upsetting probability might be useless or even detrimental as a manager. Your future also depends more on your ability to demonstrate your work than to actually do something useful, which makes sense, but the company does not do a nearly good enough job teaching you how to perform such demonstration the way it is expected of you. Sometimes you have to choose between doing something useful for your team or something good for your ""career"". Having to stick to all those internal proprietary tools (that are otherwise great to have) makes it hard for you to do much if you leave the company and those tools behind.

You might end up in a team that won't be nearly a good match or might get a wrong role due to the recruiters making mistakes and then neither recruiters nor managers caring about fixing them.

HRs pretend to be your friends, but make no mistake - they are not. They only seem to care whether you are a potential issue to the company. If an issue might go away as a result of them bullying you - they might do that, as actually figuring out how to fix internal culture is harder than putting pressure on people.

The company keeps changing internal performance evaluation requirements, disrupting rythm of work on regular basis probably so someone up high might add ""revamped evaluation process"" etc to own resume at the cost of all the damage to the rest of the company. The CEO, Sundar Pichai, is great at photo ops, but otherwise uninspiring. The company's top management pushes American politics onto the rest of the company even if you are outside of the US. If you do not share radical left-wing American perceptions - either learn to stay silent or start searching for another job.

In 2019 there was a big situation where a bunch of black employees and their ""allies"" were harassing a white employee for that employee being unfortunate outside of work to call the police after noticing a black man who acted as a trespasser and who refused to leave. The top management of the company in a company-wide meeting ""addressed"" the situation by pledging their support to the black employees and said nothing at all that would prevent similar harassments in the future.

There are an incredible number of opportunities in all kinds of domains, and Google makes project and location transfers smooth and fast. In most countries, the compensation and benefits are top of market.
","Google is on a downward trajectory, and it’s depressing. VP-level leadership doesn’t appear to understand the simple fact that processes have a cost, and it boggles the mind. Every new VP introduces more random process without ever worrying about the cost to time and morale, and then erects a wall of program managers and forms to insulate from any criticism or pressure to simplify.

Worse, most VP-mandated process is introduced because the VPs don’t trust middle management to do its job. Criticism and comments are discarded without response, and managers and directors I have spoken to are completely resigned.

The beatings continue until morale improves.
Advice to Management
Trust the middle managers and directors. Stop it with the one-size-fits-all-50k-engineers and mandatory four-week processes to file forms in triplicate to do anything, regardless of whether it makes sense. Actually listen, don’t just give us a canned response.

2020-11-24, Software Developer,"Gurgaon, Haryana, Haryana",Current Employee,Best firm for Software Developers!,"Google offers free food, with various dining halls at the Googleplex catered to all kinds of cuisine. On a given day, there are options ranging from pasta to fresh sushi rolls, sandwiches, salads, and other kinds of Asian cuisine. There are even cafes at Google that allow employees to get a free coffee pick-me-up from a local third-wave cafe, on campus.
Google offers on-site physicians, nurses, medical services, and health care coverage to keep its employees happy and healthy. Googlers can travel without worries; employees are covered with travel insurance and emergency assistance on both personal and work-related vacations.
Google offers its employees one of the most innovative work environment cultures. Google cares so much about innovation, that one of its principles encourages Google employees to spend 20% of their time pursuing innovative ideas about which they are passionate. Products and applications, such as Google News, Google Alerts, and Google Maps Street View, have been born from this principle.
Google offers shuttle services to employees who work out of its Googleplex so they can avoid long wait times in traffic and even the stress of driving to work. Every morning, big black buses equipped with WiFi pick up employees to get to the office.
Google also offers some of the best paid parental leave for new parents. Its employees have paid leave up to 18 weeks if the father is the primary caregiver, or seven weeks otherwise. Mothers are still entitled to 22 weeks of maternity leave. Google cares so much about new parents that it offers parents one-on-one consultations to figure out their scheduling for daycare options, money to spend on baby bonding time, as well as four child care centers on one of its campuses.
Google also offers a Global Education Leave program, which enables employees to take a leave of absence to pursue further education. All of this education is covered by Google.
Since Google is one of the most well-known technology companies in the world, it offers employees better job prospects should they decide to leave the Googleplex. It also offers growth within the company, whether it be for middle management or higher-level management opportunities.
Working at Google provides employees with a sense of contributing to the worldwide population. Google employees positively impact society with the applications and technology on which they are working. These technologies would surely benefit the human race; for example, self-driving cars could enable its passengers to catch up on sleep during their commutes. Its accident rate is uncanny, with just a handful of accidents in the more than 20 million miles driven since January 2020, many of which were determined to be caused by human error.
Google only looks for the best and brightest minds, and employees are always exposed to other amazing employees and intelligent thinkers. Being around other intelligent thinkers allows for a creative work environment, collaboration, and disruptive innovation.
To help with morale, employees are free to bring their pets to work. Some Googlers describe that being able to bring their pets to work keeps their energy levels up, as well as bringing joy to other employees.
Although there are highly intelligent employees at Google, there is no rocket science that goes into Google offering one of the best work environments. Google simply treats people with respect and supports its employees' creative and innovative endeavors.
","The competition is brutal.
Let’s face it: When you work for one of the biggest organisations in the world, your employer can easily afford to select the best – which makes for a highly competitive environment. When you work alongside some great talent, competition will be pretty much inevitable.

Learning is self-driven.
There is an expectation that you will actively continue to educate yourself and expand your knowledge as a Google employee. You are encouraged to commit to self-improvement as well as expanding your skills. Some might see this as an imposition on their time, but it is simply part of life in today’s ever-changing work environment – especially in technology – and many businesses have adopted a similar culture.

Launches drive advancement.
Google is known to promote staff as a result of product launches rather than as a reward for incremental improvements. Of course, in reality, most software developers will be involved in code improvement and bug fixing, yet the incentive scheme is not generally geared towards taking that into account.

Work-life balance – not always balanced.
Many modern American companies have developed a contrived culture of lingering at work. Ambitious, new or young talent may end up hanging out at the office outside of work hours, often working or learning. This can develop into peer pressure to spend a lot of time at the office. Apart from coffee shops and libraries, some places have “sleep pods” for that swift power nap to help you keep going for longer. The Toronto Office even has a crazy golf putting green on the roof!

TK is doing well to orient the organization, however the VMWare sales staff need to work with engineering and product. Sales org is totally out of whack with what GCP is.

Make product a focus as well to prevent runaway engineers from building products no one wants to use but gets engineers to get promoted as they built something complex.

Make cloud promotions easier, lots of L5/6/7 talent is leaving for facebook, amazon and even microsoft. The reason is slow pace of promotions and slow erosion of benefits by the CFO.

","the performance culture incentivizes the absolutely wrong behavior
impossible to get promoted now that there are so many people and the requirements at job levels are arbitrary
Googlers who've been there forever and been promoted have clearly been promoted past their level of competence
Arbitrary leveling during hiring usually brings people in at the wrong level
Advice to Management
the google culture is not helping you, it's hurting and should change to be team focused, not individual performer
nobody does anything to help the team or the customer, just themselves during promotion. 
Promo cycles are a huge wasted effort. You need to make it way more efficient.

2020-10-26, Technical Solutions Engineer,"Waterloo, ON","Current Employee, more than 1 year",Big company - safe haven,"- Strong hiring process ensures that the bar is in general fairly high. Of course there are always exceptions
- Decent benefits. Far better than rivals Amazon or Microsoft. But no match to other Bay Area counterparts such as Facebook or Netflix. 
- Bureaucracy is there. But the company tends to be data driven and makes tough decisions based on where the data points. Which means that the typical corporate fiefdom politics will have diminishing returns in the medium to long term.
","- Big company. Which means the company culture is rather diluted in day to day experience. What really matters is the team, organization, manager and role that you sign up for
- Tough to make an impact as there are plenty of smart people around. This means the ones who are well entrenched in the system tend to perform better. As a new comer, don't expect immediate success
- Imposter syndrome is a real thing. But you need to remember that this is a well oiled machine and will function very well without any single individual. This includes even the CEO - Pichai. Yes, Google will run very well without him.
- Expect to be low balled in terms of salary/designation. Google has plenty of applicants. And they can always find a better person for the role at a cheaper price given enough time. So be ready to eat humble pie and join on the company's terms.

","I've worked for Google 5 years by the point I moved to Netherlands to work for this division. 

I was discriminated for not being Dutch. I was discriminated for being a woman and technical.

I especially do not recommend that you work for Kate Adams/Anne Spijk***.

During my medical leave of back pain, she and her replacement used to call me back into the office every week or second week in order to harass me about how I am feeling. To try to convince me to quit, well at the same time a colleague was similar issues was treated like a queen. when I mentioned that I was told to my face that I'm not Dutch and can't expect to be treated the same. 

I was frozen out of work by an underperforming colleague. I was recommended to be less me, because this person was 10 years older than me and intimidated because I had been in the company for longer time than him, because I was a higher level, because I was far more technical, 10 years younger, having lived in San Francisco, etc.

basically I was asked by my manager to be less of myself because I intimidate one male colleague that she had a crush on. she actually said directly to me that if time comes to choose between him and myself she will choose him. He had been at the company for 6 months and was not performing. I was for 5 years. 

He was subsequently fired for underperformance 6 months after I resigned on a settlement due to harassment from my direct manager. 

I genuinely believe that my manager had a crush on this person despite of them both being married with children.

Google is the new Microsoft/government job, bureaucracy to the very core. 

Your product/project will likely be cancelled, and it won't be a drop in the ocean. 95% of the staff is just reducing probable risk or cost or compliance work. Innovation is dead, and company is too marred by process to execute anything. Acquisition is Google's only remaining innovation strategy, which too takes 2-3 years. 

For those passionate about a tech career/impact I strongly recommend finding a real job instead (startup).

2020-10-03, Technical Solutions Manager,"New York, NY","Former Employee, more than 1 year","Good benefits, bad everything else","Google pays reasonably well, and makes an effort to keep employees happy enough to stay.
The benefits are great, and the pay is competitive.
","It is nearly impossible to transfer into engineering if you aren’t already there, and the company culture is very strange. You are expected to be friends with your coworkers, and you are expected to treat Google as though it is the best company in the world. 
The diversity and inclusion strategies are very tokenizing. As a queer person, I was immediately asked to get involved with diversity efforts. 
The culture also seems to be such that people like to pretend that Google is not a corporation that makes money.
Worth mentioning also that I was hired for a job description that had nothing to do with my actual role. 
They told me it was consulting but turns out it was product support. Big fat lie.
Also, the team I was on did things that were antithetical to the company’s “mission” and cloaked it under the guise of a necessary evil. 

Basically, unless they offer you a job as an engineer, avoid.
Advice to Management
Be transparent with your incoming hires about their roles. Accept the fact that you are a corporation. Don’t expect the minorities to speak up for themselves. Make an effort to keep things equitable and honest.

2020-09-30, Technical Program Manager,,"Current Employee, more than 10 years",A shell of it's former self,"Benefits are solid. Health, dental, yearly bonus, vacation, and pay raises are amazing.
","The culture and environment has become a joke. Google was once the most sought after company for employment, but it has lost it's unique charm from over a decade ago. Now it's a corporate monster that has grown far too big. We were once the #1 company on Forbes' 100 best companies to work for and it hurt us deeply when we dropped to #2 after many years at the top. Fast forward to 2020 and we don't even make the top 100.

There is a serious lack of coherence and communication anymore. Motivation to succeed is not based on making great products, but instead on what you can do for promotion. This is clearly evident in the products we develop - or develop then abandon. It's also why we once had nine discrete messaging apps while many other products included messaging functions.

The world would be a better place if great ideas like Google Fiber, Stadia, and Voice were better executed. However, we're left with products that are not only made fun of by the public, but given countdown clocks to when they'll be discontinued. What remains are disjointed products like Gmail - including a UI so butchered and bloated, they needed to add a loading screen so you didn't think long loads times means the service is down. 

We once did great work and were on the top of the tech world. This is no longer the case and I doubt we could ever get there again. We're too large, too slow, too disparate, and have so many competing visions, that there is no return to our former glory days.

2020-09-30, Account Manager (Sales),"New York, NY","Former Employee, more than 5 years",Great company to settle down,"- best perks in the tech industry
- great salary and equity compensation
- great work/life balance (depending on the team you work on)
- great job to have when you're ready to settle down, get a mortgage, have children, 9-5pm, work from home once/week, take lots of vacations. You will see people who have been working at Google like this for +10 years with very junior titles who are very happy. Success isn't always about the never-ending race to the top at work, spending time with families is also ok and Google provides the opportunities for that.
","- Google sucks the best talent in the market, people who should be using their skills to be doing amazing, ground-breaking work to improve our society, are instead optimizing for how to get more clicks. You'll be surrounded by people who are way overqualified for the job they do but are only there because of the ""golden cuffs"" (the free food, the endless perks, and work/life balance). 
- eng vs. non-eng divide. Engineers get the best perks, salaries, off-sites, offices, etc. If you are not engineer, you're disposable, master degrees in anything else but computer science don't really have any weight here. MBAs won't automatically give you a different title or responsibilities at Google than a college grad.
- Really hard to move laterally once you have reached the plateau of your learning curve. If you're no longer challenged or happy with your job, why invest in you when they have hundreds of people lined up to take your job?
- no diversity among senior management (few women or people of color who are, in turn, not interested in raising people up the career ladder).
Advice to Management
Invest in good management training, ensure that people of color have great managers who are invested in their professional careers and have quarterly OKRs for this. Otherwise the internal surveys (both the official one and the ones led by ERGs) will continue to show negative results among employees of color and you will not have diversity at the most senior levels. If you want to be a leader in D&I, please prioritize this.

Great perks
Lots of fun problems to work on
3/5 bosses were excellent, 1/5 bosses was good (and the other would show up in the cons)
RSU stock grants were amazing. If you stay at Google for a few years, those RSUs really start to stack.
","Sales job (initial entry level job) became boring pretty quick - lots of sales reps tried to move into product / strategy roles (with good reasons I think)
Google is now just a big company - there's lots of people and a competitive talent pool. This makes getting stretch opportunities a rarity.
Lots of distraction from day-to-day work with protests against Google in China, DoD deals, sexual harassment, etc. While the sexual harassment protests were definitely merited and Andy Rubin was absolutely in the wrong, I thought there was frequently more negativity than was warranted against the company that fed you 3x/day, paid you handsomely, and gave you the chance to interact with other amazing people.
Advice to Management
Ultimately, I decided to leave because I determined I could learn more by leaving Google than by staying within Google. I had a great 4 years though, and am proud to be an ex-Googler.

","Perks and role requirements blatantly misrepresented and greatly exceed contract. You better learn to do everything; code, manage, lead, but without corresponding comp. Long hours that bleed into personal life.

Core contributions marginalized in favor of ""grand visions"". Professional advancement artificially suppressed by committee. Zero long-term vision or commitment. When contacted about discrepancy in offer, HR blamed recruiter and ""walked back"" written promises about total comp after contract was signed.

Original ""Googley"" company culture, benefits, innovation has been killed in name of cost efficiency and scale. Company actively discriminates against conservative viewpoints.
Advice to Management
Do not misrepresent responsibilities of ladders. Do not marginalize hygiene contributions by core members. Don't favor of glorified contributions by vocal minority with a ""grand vision"" (that they then proceed to quickly abandon).

Slow career progression and lack of opportunities to move fast and innovate.
Advice to Management
The company should strike a better balance. The ""people-first"" mindset does makes low performers comfortable (resting and vesting) and sacrifices strong performers who struggle to find opportunities and leave. In the medium-long term this cannot benefit the Company.

When rating people during perf cycle, listen to the colleagues, not only to an immediate manager, because s/he might have a nasty hidden agenda in mind.

","Working in Dublin has some challenges due to property crisis, and Google Ireland continues to ignore this. For example the company wants staff back in Ireland by Dec 31st, even though it’s unclear whether the office will be open. In addition many staff have been vocal about the impact on their wellbeing of working out of a damp overpriced Dublin flat (the alternative being living hours from the city), but the company doesn’t seem very concerned.

You get to use awesome developer tools-- everybody who leaves misses the tools. Great perks: free food, gym onsite, etc. Very stable and secure job (even during covid). It will look good on your resume forever if you can get here! I'd say try to get in and work a few years to build your skillset but if you don't get a good project then move on.
","So many smart and ambitious people who want to do the Next Great Thing that it can be hard to get a chance to work on a good project. Some people can get lost in the shuffle. It is a Big Company. The interview to get in is a bit of a lottery-- lots of super smart people don't get in on the first try... or second try.

","Google hiring is the most ridiculous process ever - Its a joke! they make you go through 3 months of crazy interviews with dumb questions. You keep your life on hold for things to pan out.

Next they will downlevel you even if you do really well in interviews cus they want to low ball you! Interviewers dont want to see anyone joining from a non FAANG company at a higher level they joined!

Once you are past these stages and are at the finishing line - You are told that the position is eliminated! 

 You make things more complicated then they should be and exploit job seekers. Take this somewhere else - Pathetic!
Advice to Management
Grow up and get your act together, Stop hiring for roles which dont exist!
You cant pull this act for too long! Google's best days are behind it!

The culture is very free and flexible, and it’s very ground up company. 
Management is more like a adviser to coach you on career development, and give us the freedom to do what we want to do to enhance our career. 
Even during the covid-19, Google pay attention to our well being, we have 1000$ to purchase WFH furnitures and they even give free holidays to take care of ourselves. 
I’m very lucky I’m working at Google.
","Sometimes, thing could move slower than expected as Google is growing to be a giant company. But it’s not a big deal, overall the speed and efficiency is much faster than any other firms I’ve worked at.

Advice to Management
Most of the management I've met or worked with is pretty well inept. Huge tribalism and self centered behavior among managers, if it doesn't help them they do not care. 

Lets also take about hiring practices. Targeting minority groups and making quotas, accepting anyone who fits a demographic being targeted is diversity, but it creates issues also. Rampant entitlement, lack of responsibility, management not holding folks accountable, and tanking great engineers/technicians because folks are weaponizing HR against White and Asian Men.

2020-08-31, Software Engineer,"Mountain View, CA","Former Employee, more than 3 years","Solid Experience, would work again","- Highly competitive pay, best benefits I've seen, best perks I've seen (yes, this doesn't matter, but when everything else is good, this helps).
- Very strong individuals. The average engineer here is very skilled and some of the best in the industry are here. This does not mean everyone is a genius, but there are certainly some here. To do the work, you definitely don't need to be the best, but the quality here is definitely among the best I've seen (I've worked at other ""top"" companies).
- Stellar work life balance. I've seen reviews for this that are negative, but I feel like they're on the wrong team or something. My team was busier than most and promoted people quickly and I still rarely pushed over 40 hours a week. I've seen some people work significantly fewer hours as well and still progressed. You can coast at L4 if you just do basic work and rest and vest.
- Good projects if you're on the right team. If you get lucky and get on the right team then the work is definitely interesting. This can be a con if you are on the wrong team.
- Interesting tools and learning opportunities. You can definitely learn a lot about system architecture if you are new to it. You can learn about any product area and go into the little details of that domain. Some tools at Google are used elsewhere and the knowledge can be transferred (Guice, Bazel, gRPC, protos, etc).
","- Work does not translate to other jobs. You never get to work on stuff like Apache Spark, AWS S3, RabbitMQ, and other technologies that are very common in industry. Instead you learn things like BigTable, which is similar to Apache HBase but not exactly. Your knowledge of internal frameworks is mostly useless in other jobs. The concepts learned are not, however.
- Half the projects are objectively boring and stale. Most of the projects are maintaining some aspect of the system (cloud, ads, etc) and a lot of it is tedious infrastructure work.
- Office politics as usual. The general population is friendly, but this does not mean everyone. Office politics definitely do play a role.

Pay is close to what competitors offer.
","No career growth opportunities. It is generally agreed that the fastest way to climb the ladder is to leave and come back a few years later. My personal experience confirms this.
Unengaged managers.
Internal mobility is low, but restructuring is common. Many of my co-workers have been forcibly shuffled between failing projects without their consent.
Co-workers are uninterested in socialising. Most people are here just to do their 40 hours a week and get back to their families.
Skills are non-transferable. Management discourages using open-source technologies.
Hires people into roles they are over-qualified for. It seems HR are incentivised to put new hires into a role below their skill level so increase their chances of passing the interview.
Massive bureaucracy invades almost every aspect of the job. This slows on-boarding, hinders innovation, and discourages curiosity.

People are generally honest about feedback and criticism, but do it in a respectful and constructive way.

I've liked all managers, and have been able to make my own projects and priorities.

Started as a contractor for two years and was converted to full-time employee.
","Too many teams trying to do the same thing. The size of the company can make it challenging to get things done. Most projects require approvals from dozens of stakeholders with different priorities, and likely someone else is already working on the same project on a team you've never heard.

There's a paradox where collaboration is both necessary to get any project done, but also incredibly challenging. It requires you to navigate complex and overlapping org structures with simultaneous and competing priorities.

I don't blame the company for it, as it's a reality of working at any place this large.

Working at Google can be as good as it's painted out to be. When it's going well, it is by far the best job I've ever had.
","Managers play a huge role in your success and day to day happiness. Do you report to a good manager that you have a great relationship with? You're golden. Enjoy every minute of it. Unfortunately, Google has a tendency to do frequent and sometimes drastic reorgs. Sometimes this is helpful in turning a negative situation around. Other times it pulls the rug out from under workers with no other options given. Having a bad manager / team means the day-to-day is a struggle, promotions are hard to come by, and it's easy to get lost as another cog in the giant machine.
Advice to Management
Reconsider remote opportunities for full time employees. Yes, working remotely poses huge problems. But I don't think a post COVID Google should be so rigid about having all team members in the same physical location.

2020-07-12, Software Engineer,"Mountain View, CA","Former Employee, more than 1 year",Misogynistic. Toxic. Retaliatory.,"Money. That is the only pro.
","Google is the most toxic place that I have ever worked. Everyone is obsessed with levels. Yet, levels are largely determined by personal connections and stereotypes. I found out after I started that some employees had spent years researching the hiring system to game it. My coworkers were all significantly less qualified than my peers at prior jobs. My recruiter did not understand anything on my resume and pointed out that it was very different than all the resumes that she saw from entry level men. She assumed that meant that I was less qualified than them and never considered that I was far more qualified. She kept saying things that were horrifically sexist. She attempted to route me towards a non-technical position even after I had passed the interview and gotten approval from the hiring committee. The hiring processes are set up such that the recruiters determine someone's level and the interviewers and hiring committee cannot fix a mistake no matter how glaring. This results in some employees being underleveled. Most experienced women are underleveled by at least one level, but some are underleveled by multiple levels. Other employees are overleveled. This results in an entirely toxic culture. The underleveled employees are wondering what's wrong with them that their entire careers suddenly evaporated. The overleveled employees are extremely insecure and resort to bullying the underleveled employees (mostly women and people of color) because they know that they're less qualified than the underleveled employees. Even the managers who recognize what's happening are unable to fix the problems because HR is more concerned with covering up the problem. As a result, underleveled employees are being given work far below their competence level (because HR won't allow them to get higher level work) and told that they have to prove themselves again.su
Advice to Management
Admit that you have a problem. Admit that women and people of color are systematically underleveled and have been for years. Admit that all your lies have bred misogyny and racism throughout the industry. Fix the levels of current employees who were hired at the wrong level. Make reparations for the careers that have been destroyed or hampered. Reduce the emphasis on levels. Hide individual people's level and instead provide more transparency about the company as a whole. In particular, the average amount of experience for each level upon hire broken out by gender.

2020-07-07, Associate Account Strategist,"Ann Arbor, MI","Former Employee, more than 1 year","Too sales-y, losing sight of their mission","Great people, amazing pay and perks
","In this unit, it's too focused on the sales when the position was not initially stated as such. They're losing sight of the helping customers aspect in lieu of incredibly difficult targets for employees and higher profits for corporate. Work-life balance is lacking, unless you happen to be incredibly good at this role. Proclaim they want you to have a life outside of Google, yet emphasize sales targets more than anything.
Advice to Management
Be clear about what the job entails before hiring. Being told you don't belong after such a rigorous interview process is very disheartening. It's hard to believe in the mission when the ""culture fit"" and goals of the position are contradictory. Several employees less interested in sales feel they'd love to stay with Google in any other position, but if we can't succeed in sales, we're told we don't ""fit."" Try spending some time in the associates' shoes—you'd be surprised about what they deal with day-to-day. Finally, with the amount of money this unit brings in for the company as a whole, salaries should be automatically higher (not just bonuses).

The industry analyst will sing, your partners are going to dance, your customer will be blinded and perhaps GCP will become a big revenue contributor to Google - perhaps. Make sure the money and investments continue, soon as the wine runs out everyone wakes up with a bad hangover. And that is the truth

The people are smart and nice, its a good work environment. They're very generous during the pandemic as well.
","There's a lot of bureaucracy, especially in the Search org. Programming style guides are a bit out of control, to the point where conformity is a goal in and of itself. For example, strings using double quotes in javascript are outright banned! Also, teams at google seem to not really care about product quality, but instead focus on metrics and ways to be promoted. You'll often see projects launched successfully one year, only to be removed the next year - both of which can be used to justify promotions. And yet, long standing bugs and usability issues get ignored, because bug fixes and core usability improvements aren't incentivized.

It's harder and harder to make an impact and the culture is changing now...,"Stable, growth, opportunity, people are usually great. It still builds great products at scale that no company can rival. Perks and benefits remain top of class.
","Getting so big it's that scope is shrinking. Innovation is less so than that it used to be. The leaders are more about protecting downside risk than really making the bold bets of Google's past. It was disheartening to see this trend towards less transparency and bold ""bets.""
Advice to Management
Make sure to keep hiring innovators who really can drive change and bring back the Google culture of old which was about having ""healthy disregard for the impossible"". I think now that the founders are gone, it will be a tough road to recapture this magic. 

Also, the People Ops org has lost a great deal of respect both internally and externally. It used to be a shiny beacon on a hill that other organizations looked up to and emulated (Laszlo Bock days). 

For People Ops, the answer always seemed to be ""hire more people"" rather than fix some of the tools, systems, and process that created the inefficiencies to begin with. Maybe this just comes with scale and growth, but the humanity seemed pretty far stripped and all about protecting Google's assets first and foremost.

There was a sense of ego that permeated much of what the org did that I found off-putting: admit when you screw up and take ownership. Use outside vendors SW when it makes people's jobs easier. Make faster decisions that scale with the business and commit to making everyone's job easier in People Ops, not harder.

","In spite of Google's quirky reputation, it's a massive company with all the red tape, processes, layers, etc typical of big companies. As a result, I've found the process of writing software here to be exceedingly tedious, as my time is swallowed up by learning internal tools and standards.

There is no semblance of a ""start-up"" or ""hacker"" environment. If you need an environment that is engaging, fast pace, multi-faceted, and gives you the ability to solve higher level problems and use creative skills, you will likely find the work environment here to be suffocating.
Advice to Management

2020-04-29,Anonymous,"London, England, England","Former Employee, less than 1 year","They talk the talk, but don't walk the walk","- As someone joining their corporate side from a different industry, getting a tech level salary felt amazing.

- Equity offer is a blast.

- Opportunities for global relocations.
","Crash-landing in Google from a well structured, corporate environment, was absolutely shocking, to a degree where my brain just froze. It is an unprecedented level of chaos that honestly, no one expects from a brand like theirs. Admittedly, it must be grand to work for Google as an engineer, but for the downtrodden 2% which their corporate side represents, it is demotivational, stressful and very, very badly structured place.

- Every corporate job assumes you are an engineer - requirement (badly communicated during the interview process, btw) to understand and use programming languages and various convoluted systems which don't talk to each other for even the simplest tasks. Pulling data together requires one writing their own scripts even if working in, say, facility management.

- Work-life balance is a myth. Everyone is super stretched. Priorities pile on top of priorities. Diaries are triple-booked with pointless meetings. No head-down time during the day. Most staff work weekends and are on email until they go to bed, despite management banging on how this is not the expectation.

- Tendency to bring meetings forward - if you have 30 mins free in your diary, expect someone to fill that in with a later meeting, creating a situation where you are suddenly late and being chased on Hangouts.

- Practically zero support, despite promoting ""supportive culture"". Processes are badly structured and even worse documented. Your only hope are colleagues. There are many genuinely nice people, but they mostly don't have the time to deal with newbies, endlessly rescheduling trainings and meetings while you drown.

Very case specific, but my line manager turned me down flat several times when I was asking for help. Her instructions were often one line on the back of an email chain going back months. When I finally quit, her only consideration was who had I talked to and did I somehow blame her officially. I didn't out of pure fear...

2020-04-28, Product Marketing Manager,,"Former Employee, more than 5 years",Ups and downs during my 5 years,"Great benefits

Offices everywhere so opportunities to travel

Massive company with lots of roles and projects so always new opportunities to explore

Company values executional excellence

There are teams that you can choose to be on that are rigorous and will work you hard, but also an opportunity to just ""rest and vest"" by going to certain teams. In those positions you can have a good work/life balance and just use all the benefits

Generally found the Google teams open to remote work. For example, working from home on Fridays. Typically, no one micro-manages your day-to-day schedule. Some managers might be different though

People are open even if they're on a different team to having a random meeting scheduled for you to get to know them or their team if you're interested in what they do
","While perks are great, sometimes salaries are below market rate

Became progressively less open during my 5 years. For example, they severely cut down on the frequency (and I think ended up canceling all-together during my last couple of weeks) the regular all-company meetings

A lot of drama with all of the scandals and constant protests. I found checking my email I would sometimes feel stressed out

Not much progress on the diversity front even over the course of 5 years. From day one, I heard about how much of a priority it was, but the representation numbers hardly moved and the sentiment from the underrepresented communities didn't get better either

Middle managers are often not good. Manager training isn't amazing so it really depends on the individual. Some really value being a manager and care about their people, but they're not required to do so. I've been part of situations where whole teams complained about an abusive manager to HR and nothing happened
Advice to Management
Although the company is huge now, need to find ways to still engage with employees. It feels now with new rules around email list discussions and the cancelling of TGIF, there isn't an appetite to engage with employees and let them know what's going on

2020-04-24, Interaction Designer,,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",Truly one of the best places to work,"The people are the best part, my colleagues are some of the brightest, kindest, most driven and thoughtful humans I've had the pleasure to work with. The company does take care of you as I think people see in the media with perks and such, but it is also a lot more transparent than other large corp. places where I've worked and decision-making, feedback, and general growth. I feel like they're taking exceptionally good care of us and our non-full-time counterparts during the pandemic as well, which makes me even more grateful that usual to be here.
","It's big and you really have to show measurable benefit of your work to move up. This is easier in some parts of the company / some roles than others. You work with really ambitious, bright people, and that can wear on your sense of your own ability sometimes (cue imposter syndrome), but people tend to understand this and are supportive. It's not a utopia, there are bad apples in every bunch. I think it's easier to be critical coming from other big tech companies, but having come from a non-big-tech background, it's miles and above other large companies.

The flexible location, flexible hours, and remote/in person clock-in was fantastic. Combined with excellent food on campus and vibrancy of NY, fantastic place to work. New York campus is surprisingly robust, has a great culture. It doesn't feel like a satellite office.
Cons
The chief drawback is not being at Mountain View HQ if you're looking to move up in company long term. That's the power center.

2020-03-21, Contractor,"London, England, England",Former Employee,Not what I had expected as a contractor,"-big company with a lot of freedom to do your work however you want to
-free, tasty meals throughout the day
-nice offices with enough breakout areas
","-2 class system with divide between Googlers and contractors
-lots of fakeness from a lot of employees. Many people pretend to be happy go lucky and caring people to impress their superiors but once they are out of sight they show their true colours
-Googlers will categorically ignore you and spend less time with you if you are a contractor
-Zero job security. I was made redundant before the end of my contract
-I am disappointed with the level of intelligence in many employees. A lot of them are very average but will try to talk down on you for no reason
-Not much diversity especially in leadership roles
-No proper onboarding for contractors. There is chaos when you first start and you are expected to figure it out on your own. This leads to a lot of inefficiency and time loss
-No proper access for contractors for internal tools and resources. We are unable to do our work in a time efficient way, so many obstacles in getting access to internal documentation.
Advice to Management
Please just guarantee work for contractors within their minimum contract term time. As a huge global company you surely have the means to do that. Stop playing with people’s job securities.

Actively try to help contractors get a permanent Google role after 1 year. Prioritise them once their contract is nearing the end or they are made redundant.

Give contractors the same authorisations to work with internal tools and documentation.

What you've read in the press is true, and doesn't just affect activists (although they bear the brunt of it.) It affects anyone in a toxic team. Employee satisfaction surveys are a joke. Managers who get the lowest scores possible are still promoted. 

Google used to be a welcoming place to work. Now that's just a superficial image with massive problems brushed under the carpet. Everyone I know is burnt out and looking to get away.

2020-03-02, Program Manager,"Boulder, CO","Current Employee, more than 3 years",Google Boulder is the place to be!,"Unlike previous tech companies I have worked for, I rarely feel overworked at Google. Managers and team mates are respectful of work-life balance and even promote flexible work hours. The colleagues that I work with are all such nice people and I attribute that to the emphasis that the company puts on only hiring people that are Googley and how performance is partially measured on how well you work with others to accomplish a goal. Google Boulder in particular is fantastic with new office facilities, high quality (free) food, and a laid-back office atmosphere.
","Compared to my previous employers, the purse strings at Google are extremely tight when it comes to T&E. Many teams only have the budget to see their non-colocated managers and co-workers face-to-face one a year, which is a real shame and can be a huge productivity hindrance. This does not seem to be getting better YoY.

In terms of progressions, it depends on the department. Majority of staff switch to other departments so they could climb to the next career ladder, and this is normal at Google.

2020-02-06, Technical Account Manager,"New York, NY","Former Employee, more than 3 years","Focused too much on metrics, we were understaffed, implicit pressure to work on weekends","Great compensation, benefits, and food.
","Far too focused on metrics, which ate into productive time.

Our department was understaffed for half a year. Which meant we spent more time working on tickets, and less on more interesting project work that could yield great reductions in ticket work.

The type of work was not good long-term for a career as it was primarily product support. If you are a software developer considering a role as a Technical Account Manager, it could be hard to get back into software development later.

No easy way to measure difficulty/complexity of a ticket, so an easy one would net you the same amount of credit as a difficult one. So the incentive was to take lots of easier tickets, which caused resentment.

You feel an implicit pressure to work first thing when you wake up, then again after work, and even on weekends to meet certain metric goals.

2020-01-31, Software Engineer,"Mountain View, CA","Former Employee, more than 1 year",Tons of Bureaucracy,"Lots of great things about Google that other people summarized. But to give my list:
- Smart coworkers (on average)
- Best tech infrastructure of any company in the world
- Reasonable work-life balance
- Perks and Food
","- So much bureaucracy, tons of pointless meetings, lots of decisions being made for political reasons. As a ""rank-and-file"" software engineer, there were instances where I disagreed with what was asked of me and was told to do it anyways without being given a convincing reason for why (the cynical reason is that doing it would get someone promoted).
- Promotion process is broken. There were instances where I did what was best for the product/company, and it hurt me when it came to perf time.
- Hiring bar lowered over time. It's still okay, but definitely not as high as some smaller companies.
- The food is free, but it's not great. I'd rather pay for good food.

2020-01-30, Senior Technical Product Manager,"London, England, England","Former Employee, more than 1 year","Lost its mojo: lonely, frustrating and disappointing place to work.","Context: gTech team

- Perks, benefits and pay (if those are important to you; they aren't as impactful to most as they think in the long run and create an over-privileged, ungrateful workforce)
- Travel and freebies opportunities
- Looks good on a CV/outside perception strong
- Flexibility in working hours/how you manage your time
- Clubs and talks, volunteering opportunities
- Stable company
","Context: gTech team

- Still too US (Silicon Valley) focused. Incompatible culture with Europe mindsets
- Still culturally tailored to 20 something privileged (Ivy league) males e.g. having to share hotel rooms at most events, expecting people to want to relocate, and assuming everyone is the same in terms of motivations and beliefs
- BIG ethical problems- see news
- Management are very poor: low EQ, lots of turnover/infighting, just care about results not people. Don't like it when people question them even though they say the opposite- lack integrity and many are bullies or just keep their heads down and do nothing.
- Many people are managed by people several timezones away leading to poor communications and relations. Fundamental misunderstandings arise because there is an assumption, by the US mainly, that because people speak English they share a culture.
- People are very competitive, arrogant, and selfish, don't care about each other as people due to low EQs and being over-privileged or insecure. A person can faint or breakdown in tears in a meeting and everyone will just ignore them.
- Low internal mobility if you want to stay in London- it's very competitive and if you enter a bad role/team and have bad projects, it's near impossible to transfer, especially because you need your manager to help. Getting stuck is easy; HR are no help.
- Low trust in HR and Employee Relations- so much sexism, ageism and mental health discrimination. Google keeps paying people to keep quiet. HR are near useless (by their own admission) because they have no power. Again, see news.
- Company is classic large corp now- ruled by middle managers empire building. Historical culture is not really present anymore, e.g. no 20% projects allowed.
- Work is meaningless- little control over strategy, repeating past projects/mistakes, impact of deliverables questionable as they are politically driven more than anything.
- Work is still technically driven and people who bring project management experience are not well respected as they are seen as an unnecessary overhead and remind people that Google is now a large company and cannot support old practices such as one to ones with everybody and informal knowledge transfer.
- Lots of big company politics and constant problems with delivery because company is still technically driven rather than people/process/organisation driven
- Internal systems/tools not fit for purpose unless you are an engineer. Refusal/arrogance-led negative attitudes to using external tools such as JIRA or project management tools. Everyone just uses Google Suite for everything- with some hacky tools built on top sometimes.
- Lots of internal snobbery over working for gTech- little respect or knowledge from the rest of Google
- Interview system is ridiculously complicated, and has tons of bias, and doesn't recruit the people needed due to the abstract coding questions that people need to answer to prove that they are ""technical"" even when the job doesn't require coding. You therefore end up with people who want to code in jobs where they aren't required to code which causes a lot of problems.
Advice to Management
Stop hiring/promoting people based on technical competence and get some managers who actually understand and like people.

Remote management is bad. Have people managers colocated.

Give HR/ER more power to remedy situations that don't involve putting people on stress leave or just moving managers.

Fire/demote bad managers.

Train managers properly.

Stop thinking Google can operate like it did 15 years ago- it's a completely different company- different people, values, ethics and culture.

2020-01-17, Google Cloud Manager,"London, England, England","Former Employee, more than 3 years","Google Cloud - Great brand, but toxic environment","This review is about Google Cloud. Biggest perks were big company name (great to have on CV), big offices, multicultural & diverse colleagues/teams, casual dress code, lots of training courses/seminars available, and supportive of employees relocating to different roles and countries. 

Salary and benefits were good, but nothing special compared to any other big-ish tech company. 

Work from home was not ‘officially’ supported, but can be possible depending on your team and manager. Every team was different. Some more tolerant of it than others. 

Free food was a nice perk, but it's also a bit overrated. I think it's more about the convenience rather than the food being free. E.g. it was nice to not have to think about what or where to eat. 

Good choice of latest tech. You had a choice between latest Google, Apple, Windows devices for what you needed at work.
","From my experience in Google Cloud specifically (can’t speak on other parts of Google), it had all the symptoms of a toxic environment and an unhealthy workplace. It was quite shocking to see and not what you would expect from Google. I was also very surprised as not many reviews on Glassdoor reflected this. 

In short, there was an abundance of crazy workloads, no work-life balance, poor morale, very aggressive people, strong argument culture (lots of tearing others down), destructive gossip, very political, poor leadership, poor communication, chaos and disorganisation. 

In more detail: 

1. Workloads were very intense with impossible targets and no work-life balance. From what I’ve experienced, the morale was very poor. Employees felt very miserable, were in high stress all the time, were overworked and almost never took holidays. And if they did took holidays, it was very common for them to be working during their time off (often not by choice, but because of the high pressure and intense workload). As much as people loved working for Google (massive brand), not many employees had many positive things to say about being in Google Cloud, but most would endure because of the brand. Constant complaining and venting were very common. Breaking down and crying in the office were also common. It was widely known and acknowledged that this was a problem but for years, not much has been done to correct and the situation remained the same. 

2. I was also quite shocked by the style of working. Yes, you do work with very smart people, however, many were also very aggressive. It was their style to get things done and it was what had worked for them. Many others were just good ‘talkers’, but were not good at actually doing things or making things happen. If you’re dependent on them to hit your targets in a high pressure environment, it can be quite challenging to work with. 

3. Your experience will probably be better if you had a good manager. I was unlucky to have had a toxic one. I was heavily micromanaged, constantly chased and workload consistently increased. I witnessed the whole team being in a state of misery and being overworked. It was a very negative vibe and very hard to watch. 

4. The organisational structure was quite heavy and not flat. You had high pressure, but everything moved very slowly and was overly complicated. There were many layers and many middle managers who were bad leaders with poor leadership skills. Not sure why this was. There were some strong leaders, but very very few. 

5. I found the way the company did performance reviews to be quite outdated. It was based on peer reviews and was done twice a year. Because it was done on a peer basis, most would select peers they got along with or those who would give them good reviews. 

6. In general, the environment was very chaotic, disorganised, and lots of last minutes. Lots of silos and duplicate efforts. Everything was broken and nothing worked the way it should. So there were lots of firefighting and troubleshooting for very simple things. 

Systems and tools were usually made in-house and I found many of them to be outdated. The company liked to create their own tools versus using tools from third parties. There were pros to this, but the downside was that many of them were just outdated and inferior compared with other tools on the market, which can make your day to day job frustrating. 

7. Overall I do not recommend Google Cloud and would advise anyone to stay away. But if you are considering, do take caution and know what you are signing up for. Do what you can to find out and decide for yourself.
Advice to Management
Setting the right culture with healthy expectations and work-life balance can only be positive to any major corporation as they scale and grow. Employees’ wellbeing are important and can only bring increased productivity when they are properly nurtured. These things can only be possible from top-down and should start with senior management. As leaders, you are accountable and you are the cause for toxic environments and bad behaviours, but you also have the power to change this. Sometimes you just need to take charge and walk the walk. I hope this can happen.

That is why you see walk-outs and hear about things that employees want to improve. 
Google executives listen and employees are empowered to speak their minds without fear of retribution. Life at Google is far better than almost any company and just about every employee comes to work and leaves work happy. All the news articles looking to find something wrong with working at Google are misguided. The writers don't understand that voicing a desire for equality, inclusion, and diversity are cornerstones of the Google culture. It doesn't mean employees are unhappy. It means they are good people fighting for continuous improvement in these areas even if Google is already excelling in these areas. People will always ask Google to do even more good for the world and their employees because they know Google will take action. It's awesome.

Work life balance is a joke. fancy onsite perks helps them stay at their desks longer, but who wants to live at the company?

Bad manager will use you as a resource. Company policy recommend fte to treat contractors as second class citizens. Even though you feel bad about that, there’s nothing you can do. It makes you the part of mean people.

2019-12-28, Senior Staffing Services Associate,"New York, NY","Former Employee, more than 3 years","Good Intentions, Struggling with Growth Momentum & Scaling","Truly the cushiest place to work on Earth. Fantastic perks, benefits, and pay. There's runway to run with creative ideas (to an extent), but as with any organization of 100,000 full-time employees globally, it can be impossible to see organizational change move quickly.
","Challenging culture of employee performance management, can beget an undercurrent of competition and rat-race syndrome to greater visibility, impact, recognition, promotion and better pay. Your experience can be really pendant on the manager and the function you're in. Managers are not as intentionally selected, well-trained, or well-incentivized as they should be. Not all managers are trained diligently enough to operate with a true servant leadership style, and it's palpable, and can be detrimental to the growth and development of employees underneath them. This is something Google is actively working to redesign, but a behemoth of an organization takes many cycles of evolution to move the needle. Prepare to constantly exist amidst re-orgs and change. The organization is so large, that the work is segmented into singular functions, and the result is that you feel this urgent need to pile project work onto your plate to prove your worth and get promotion-ready. Career opportunities are there, but internal mobility is a true black box. Feels slow-moving, inaccessible, and not very transparent. A huge hiring push across the last 3 years has made for growing pains, a culture of question-asking, and culture of leaks.

2019-12-12, User Experience Engineer,"Mountain View, CA","Current Employee, more than 5 years",Declining at a steady pace,"- Smart people
- Products that affect millions
- If you're junior it's a great learning experience
- Ability to move to other teams in the company
","- The food is free but it's become considerably worse. Specially in the Mountain View campus.
- Traffic going into campus is at all time worst
- Headcount openings for UX are at all time low
- Large amount of products getting canceled after people worked on them for 7-14 months
- Promotion biases people to work on whats important for them not whats important for the company
- The open culture is gone. Google canceled TGIF, and is locking down tons of documents that used to be available.
- The fear and obsession with empowering minorities forces them to nerf majorities by preventing them from getting promoted or getting the best work assignments
- Short selling current employees and new hires on base pay and overall TC
- Forcing shady chrome extension into employees computers without fully disclosing what they do; refusing to open the design doc for it even after people complained about transparency
Advice to Management
- Look back at Google in 2015-2016 for inspiration
- Stop trying to hire minorities just to look good. Empower the current ones, make sure they have the same rights as everyone else, not more, and specially not at the cost of people that worked hard to get where they are
- Bring back the open culture

- Some truly brilliant and helpful people
- Opportunity to eventually switch to a more worthwhile role in the company
","- Quintessentially Indian culture of sycophancy and hovering around certain ""popular"" figures, coupled with corporate double-speak around equity and transparency makes for a fascinating study in contradictions

- Convoluted, opaque (and therefore prone to hacking and favoritism) performance metrics combined with some toxic management leading to unchecked, ever-increasing meaningless busywork to stand out. 

- ""Visibility"" in front of management, who lack all touch with the day-to-day reality of the job, is emphasized above all. This encourages cynical hustling and high school-like jockeying for popularity and recognition. Or, as Google likes to call it, ""bringing your whole self to work""

- Massive sense of entitlement flowing from the Google brand reflects in hiring and onboarding - including coerced ""voluntary"" activities for new hires and relocation and joining at almost a day's notice. Expect it to become more dysfunctional if hiring ramps up

- The famed contempt for the privacy of its consumers bleeds into norms around ""openness"" and ""sharing"" that pervade the work environment.

2019-11-21,Anonymous,,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Great choice if you are in your 20s, poor choice for mid-career professionals","- extremely nice and helpful people, great perks. 

- Generally take software engineering extremely seriously.

- Hiring standards for young engineers are outstanding. We don’t hire programmers, we hire people who can think critically about problems and have the communication skills to solve them collaboratively

- after a couple of years, the pay can be quite decent if you learn to play the Perf game correctly

- senior leadership comes across as very competent, although they sometimes forget that they have gotten pretty far removed from things as the company has added more management layers
","- hiring practices tend to favor smart people who have no relevant domain experience and it can take years for those hires to become effective 

- Extremely slow moving, with lots of red tape and badly outdated product development processes not seen elsewhere since the 20th century, at least on some teams

- These processes tend to stifle the creativity and problem-solving skills that the engineers on the ground have in abundance

- insular culture of self-regard. If it isn’t a Google product or technology, no one has heard of it or has any interest in it

- Very consensus-driven decision-making, to the point at which groupthink is almost ubiquitous

- This means that lots of smart people with limited information make lots of poor decisions when they get together as a group - the hype about data-driven decisions at google is b-s

- Also worthy of note, your experience outside of Google, regardless of what you have accomplished, will be ignored or forgotten after you start. You are just another number among 100,000 others.

- You will come across people who have worked at the company for 10 years or more and have completely lost touch with the outside world, yet are somehow put in charge of building products for those users in the outside world!

- many longtime employees, including fairly senior folks, have only really shipped 1-2 products before because Google is so slow — and are much less experienced than they would otherwise appear

- In short, if you have more than 8-10 years of work experience at other tech companies, don’t work here. You will work for people who are much less experienced than you and it will set your career back
Advice to Management
- Fix the company’s PR problems and confront them head-on
- put more emphasis on experience and domain knowledge in hiring practices, now that we are a huge company 
- place more value on speed and high-quality execution. - - - Shut down all software projects that take more than 3 months to ship a first version

","In some divisions there's a strong incentive to spend a lot of time on your own perf (self evaluation), there are a few employees that are ""professional perfers"", they're excellent at embellishing their work while more humble coworkers who do a better job might not shine as much. Also in smaller satellite offices it's difficult to have the visibility required for promotion.
Advice to Management
Make sure the workers identified as top performers really are top performers at all the levels, and if they're on the sales side it would be useful to check with their customers how they feel. (e.g. did a sales rep block 3 days in the week to work on his or her perf when his or her customers are waiting for answers?). Otherwise amazing company to work for, it's very difficult to keep a great company culture with the huge growth from the last 15 years, good job!

* Community - There is a interest group for everything, board games, marathon running, ping pong. Organizing such meetings is awarded as community contributions. 
* Smart people - Nothing boosts your development as working with people smarter then you.
* Performance measured by results - No-one will blink an eye if you will leave work early, work from home for a day or two, or just spend whole day in gaming room. Of course when going for promotion or bad planning can lead people to overwork but it my experience it's employee decision
* You can always switch teams - feeling like changing something or burned out? There are pretty loose rules about changing teams. 
* Self-Development - there are lots of internal courses, options for guidance to learn how to get better at your job, or skills you want to develop.
* Focus on individualism and Collaboration - Your given hard open problems that you are directly responsible for. There is a big focus on collaborating with other teams to reach agreement.
","* Slow development cycle - When working on problems on such scale, there is lot of time spent on design and no much on coding. 
* Project Management - Every team decides on their own project management method which can lead to mismanagement and chaos. 
*Possible location + project mismatch - There are a lot of interesting projects and available locations, but there is no guarantee that you can find a match on both. There could be a great project but not available in your location. There is no option for remote work (in usual cases).

","Don't believe the glowing reviews. The company may seem fantastic if you're a fresh graduate who's still overawed by free food and on-site laundry. But once you reach the higher levels, you'll realize that the company has become a cloying, insular, and claustrophobic place. Internal technology falls further behind the outside world every day, but people still speak and act like they did when Google was years ahead of everyone else. It's an environment of total hubris.

God help you if you try to rock the boat. If you do, people snipe at you in design documents, slander your work and your mannerisms behind your back, and undermine you in performance reviews, all the while presenting just enough of a friendly facade to maintain plausible deniability. Nobody will tell you what's really going on. Very few people are interested in technical excellence. The joke is that Google hires the smartest people to ""move protos"" (i.e., do drudge work) all day. It took me years to realize that the ""move protos"" meme resonates because the L7-L9 old-time clique comes down like a fist on anyone trying to do more than make uncreative, incremental, and low-impact changes.

Maybe you don't care about technical excellence. If you don't, you won't be alone: ""merit"" and ""heroism"" are dirty words at Google. Maybe you want to work your 10-4 job, land a few CLs, eat your free lunch, get your middling performance scores, and collect your above-average paycheck, all the while crusading on memegen or whining about how unfair it is that the company evaluates your performance twice per year. If that's what you want to do, Google is the place for you. But if you're the kind of person who wants to advance technology, to apply your intellect to hard problems, and to bring something new into the world, then (unless you get extraordinarily lucky with team placement) Google will suffocate you. Go anywhere else.

2019-09-19,Anonymous,"Mountain View, CA","Current Employee, more than 1 year",A wonderful place to work before you get too burned out,"Google is a truly exceptional company to work for in so many regards. From the amazing perks like unlimited food, to free transportation to work, to everything in between, the company really does have everything you could want from a benefits package.
","The downside of having all of this, is that you attract the worlds best colleagues. Seemingly you would think this is a good thing, and while to a degree it is (pretty much everyone I work with is outright brilliant), the repercussions of this are far greater than you would initially assume. Imagine the most type A, overachieving folks in your old college classes. You know, the ones that will literally go way above and beyond to do a truly exceptional job (chances are if you work at Google you were one of those folks). Now imagine only the top 1% of all of those people are in one place at the same time. Now think about what happens to the culture when you put all of those folks together and keep hiring them as your company scales. Suddenly everyone is taking on the max possible amount of work and doing the equivalent of 3 people's workload, and then that becomes the norm for everyone. And no one will ever complain about it because at the end of the day everyone wants to be a team player and never say no to a request, regardless of the time commitment. This leads to everyone working long hours, working on vacations, and even while sick. 

To make matters worse, your manager is probably the same way. Since Google will hire a director from another company and make them a manager at Google (because Google is so big a director's scope of work will be similar to that of a manager at Google), chances are your direct manager has the ambition of a top preforming senior leader. And while they are likely to be very nice (for example my current manager is absolutely amazing) , they will set your workload based on your peer's workload since the average assumption is that if the others on the team can do it, why can't you?

Put this all together and you quickly have folks burning out left and right, and consequentially a very low average tenure for your team despite people loving their core jobs. It quite sad really because everyone I know in my Org is very happy outside of the amount of burnout they feel. 

Another important note is that it takes forever to get promoted at Google because regardless of how good the quality of your work is, you have to compete against colleagues who generally speaking are willing to do whatever it takes, and make any life compromise necessary to get promoted.

Overall, I think Google is a well intended company, with well intended employees that sadly have fell victim to losing their own culture through scaling and hiring the best.
Advice to Management
Be consciousness of what example you are setting for your directs . It is completely okay to be ambitious and hard working, but understand that type of workflow isn't sustainable over long periods of time. Very few people want to leave the team because they are unhappy, most leave because they simply are burned out and have already given everything they can to the team.

We love Google, but it has to be a team effort to keep making it a wonderful place to work as we continue to grow.

2019-09-18, Senior Software Engineer,"Seattle, WA","Current Employee, more than 10 years",Still a great company to work for,"* Almost everyone around you is pretty darn smart and works hard.
* Managers are generally competent, smart, well intentioned, but not experienced and trained as managers, as they were mostly former engineers. (this is me :-) )
* Salary and benefits are good. Free food etc.
* Performance review system is complicated but understandable. You can generally understand pretty clearly what you need to do to get promoted and succeed. At least up to L5, Senior Software Engineer.
","* It isn't as good as it used to be. 10 years ago, focus was entirely on doing the right thing for the user. Now, focus is on keeping the money train going. This short term thinking is hurting long term potential, and is often bad for users.
* Management ""Ethics"" seem to be mainly: Whatever they can get away with, without annoying European and US governments too much, and makes money, is good. Even if it is not good for our users.
* 10 years ago, we had a lot more bottom up innovation. 20% projects, taking risks, trying crazy innovative things. That's pretty much gone now. Top down planning, lots of status updates to management, proving that what you are doing is working and contributing to the organization's goals. Much more bureaucracy then there used to be.
* It's just another big company now. Good, but not exceptional the way it used to be.

2019-09-09, Data Center Technician,"Dublin, Dublin","Former Employee, more than 3 years",Falling short of expectations,"The people. The lack of micro-management. Trust. Flexibility. The environment (pool tables, computer games blah blah, if you are into that type of nonsense)

Compensation is fantastic (after time) for the type of job they ask of you. 

Information is at your fingertips. Lots of it

IT Techstop. Good lord, how I wish every company had an IT service this amazing.
","The people - specific to the DCOps environment I suspect, they can be particularly difficult to work with when so much focus is placed on their technical abilities during hiring. Those technical abilities which will likely never be anywhere near fully utilised. 

The use of the DC specific Internal learning platform. Expect to spend/waste a lot of time reading poorly created presentations and perform quizzes. If you do not like to be patronized, you will likely not like this aspect of the job. It has a fantastic purpose but is incredibly poor in its execution. All constructive criticism of the tool and it's content is never acknowledged and due to the understood benefits of the tool (despite never asking if they are actually obtaining said benefits), management do not speak out against it. Thus techs are on their own with this.

The technician title should really be changed to ""contractor management"" or something similar. It is a huge aspect of the job and oones technical skills are very rarely utilised or further developed in the environment that has become of late (2019). In the early days, one was able to grow very quickly but over time, much needed bureaucracy has crept in and slowed everything down. If you enjoy spending time, looking at paperwork and have a rubber stamp and red stapler, this is a good job for you.

2019-08-16," Data Scientist, Finance","Sunnyvale, CA","Current Employee, more than 3 years",Avoid the Finance Org!!,"Great tech infrastructure systems, but it's hard to know which ones to use. This is usually served by having senior team members who know what they're doing, but teams in Finance generally don't have that (employee churn)
","Innovation is nonexistent: too many in the company are from non-tech / corporate backgrounds. This is especially true for those in management positions. As a result, decisions made are often too conservative. There are lots of talking points about how the org is innovating what a finance department can do but most of the people who do the innovating leave as soon as they can. 

Not a gateway to Google: I joined thinking that the I could work in Finance for a while learning new skills and working on cool projects on my way to moving into the eng org. This is generally not the case. What I didn't realize when I joined is that I was on a Finance ladder. As a result, transferring to the eng org involves a full interview process. These interviews are (from many people I've talked to) more stringent than the external ones. Ask which ladder you'll be placed on before accepting the offer! (This is also why the offer was FAR lower than what I expected)

2019-07-13, Senior Account Manager,Sydney,"Former Employee, more than 10 years",Not what used to be,"- Generous benefits package, including competitive salary, free food, a beautiful office...
- Friendly colleagues from all over the world.
- Company is supportive of internal mobility. Google is a great company for anybody considering international career opportunities.
","- Many sales jobs are extremely repetitive and boring, and they offer very limited room for growth. It sometimes feel like working in a glorified customer support call centre.
- Sales organisation at Google is extremely political. Career growth is completely linked to internal politics and zero-impact projects purely made for visibility. 
- Promotions and your level affect the amount of internal opportunities available, so you need to play the politics game in order to advance your career, otherwise you can get stuck in boring roles.
Advice to Management
- Pay more attention to actual clients' needs, rather than focusing in internal metrics and priorities. 
- Support employees' career growth by rewarding real impact projects, and not just internal politics and visibility.

Lot of career change options within the Org. Good work-life balance (depends completely on your role and manager though).
","Really slow paced org, it takes mostly 2 -4 yrs to get promoted & eventually apply & move to roles in other locations. Hikes are very low 10-20% YoY, unless you get promoted which brings 30%. Lots of internal politics & plagiarism, mostly in Hyd based team. 

The Avg. Pay, growth & learnings is comparatively below standard & lower than most of the Indian startups & similar companies.
Advice to Management
Be competitive especially with the packages offered and learning opportunities. Start learning from other startups and same vertical companies in India. If the attitude doesn't change you'll mostly end up becoming another Inofsys or TCS in next 2-3 years, where people mostly join to move to an onsite :) 

The culture is primitive and needs changes, so some bit of learnings required here as well. You need to bring the HR's in to the picture inorder to reduce some bit of politics & fair growth, most of them are never seen after you join.

","- working, the actual work part, at google, is paralyzed and tedious.
- PMs. You could be a world-recognized expert in cryptography but because a first year PM has an opinion about cryptography that he read on Techcrunch, you are subjected to it.
- Arrogance. Everywhere. Designers vs. engineers. PMs vs. designers. Everyone within their team is tight, but teams fight because the company historically only needed engineers. So engineers think that they can be designers and PMs, and the ladders truly support it. So everyone is constantly vying for relevance.
- there is no leadership at this company. the founders treat TGIF like it's open mic at the local cafe's comedy night. if they even show up.
- people like james damore are given jobs here. there are a lot of them. scared, incel warcraft men.
- no barriers to movement mean nobody gives a crap about their projects. there are few experts, just project tourists looking for promo

2019-06-17,Anonymous,,Former Employee,"Sales, or 16 hour days and MINIMUM 150% of target","Great perks (if only we had the time to use them...)
","Work from home is not allowed more than once a fortnight. 
We were so overworked and so stressed no one had any time to use any of the perks. What's the point of free food and on site massages and free yoga classes if you have no time to eat and skip lunch to eat at your desk, and no time for anything else because you are pulling 16 hour days only to get a ""meets expectations"" and effectively be told you're not good enough. Engineering at Google may be great but let me tell you that's not the case in Sales. Turnover is super high (I saw many people leave) and managers only care about you achieving MINIMUM 150% of your targets plus multiple side projects in order to have acceptable performance. What's the point of setting sales targets if the unwritten rule is that you need to reach minimum of 150% of your targets and if you only reach 120% or less you will be on track to get fired. True story. Corporate rat race. Absolute hell. Join Google for engineering but please stay away from the Sales teams unless you want to work from 6am to 11pm and weekends on a regular every day basis. As my mentor told me ""If you want a 9-6 job, Google is not for you. You will not get anywhere at Google unless you put in 16 hour days"". So I left.
Advice to Management
Allow people to work from home more often. Set reasonable targets so employees don't need to work 16 hour days every day just to stay in the company

Now, with Thomas Kurian and his new posse, it's clearly becoming Oracle. We should just change the name to Oracle 2.0 since Google is effectively dead.
","In June 2019, leadership had a bright idea to redesign our compensation plan by moving it from a 50/50 split to a 40/60 split. Thus, 15 - 30% salary reductions for all sales. Mine was a $25K reduction. On paper, having a 40/60 split would be amazing because we can make more on the upside. The reality is that with a revenue recognition model that is based on consumption, you will need a healthy consumption machine to hit your number.

Google has made it clear they want new logos at the sake of large enterprise deals. Large deals take too long so go find some small workloads. Skip trying to develop a large oppty, just find some low hanging fruit. 

It was no shock that PH and Klayko was bounced. The challenge is the rest of the clowns in leadership. Chicago office has 2 - 3 managers who should be released. NYC has at least 5. Austin is hilarious. Seriously, these guys??? LOL. Time will tell but I bet a bag of breakfast tacos that all of them will be out by year's end (2019).
Advice to Management
Your Directors need to be much better. No strategy, no messaging, no confidence. All they do is resend or forward Exec messages with no message of their own. 

You are alienating some really good sales people. It's clear you expect (maybe even wish for) some attrition with the new policies and comp plans. Unfortunately, a lot of us won't stick around long enough to see this through. We are hoping for the best but recognize it's time to move on. I think 7 years at this sinking ship is enough.

2019-06-07, Product Marketing Manager,"Mountain View, CA","Former Employee, more than 8 years","Great place to coast, not great for ambitious people","- Some of the best colleagues you'll ever find. Kind, brilliant, reliable, funny.
- Great compensation for non-tech; I will not easily be able to match my total comp package elsewhere for a PMM role
- Lots of responsibility available if you want it
- Prestige factor; once you have Google on your resume you can work anywhere

I used to love working at Google - a factor of being early in my career, and starting out when the company was only 20k employees. I learned a ton and made some great friends. But over time, the cons really started bothering me and I left.
","- Stakeholder management is rough. It's a huge company that refuses to adapt to being a huge company. If you worked at Samsung or Amex, there would be a clear hierarchy of decision-making and approvals. Google is huge but teams rarely have any clear approval processes, decision-making processes, etc. It is all decided by individual team managers, most of whom don't set up a process at all or stick by it. So you end up halfway finished with a project, and then your manager will ask you to get approval from a random PM, and then you have to start all over. It's insanity and nothing gets out the door on top because of this.
- Bad managers are never held accountable. Basically if you're a star-performer individual contributor, you'll get a direct report, under the assumption that you'll create even more value when you have help. Not because you display any great leadership or managerial prowess. If your team continues to *produce good work*, you'll keep rising and you'll certainly keep your team. If you get consistently terrible management feedback scores, you'll still get promoted if you produce good work. Bad managers never get held accountable, your feedback will not get any serious response - just a LOT of meetings to ""discuss"" what's wrong and some vague action plan like ""manager will send more regular updates and hold more 1:1s"". Consequently, finding a team where you do work you enjoy AND there's a great manager is like finding the holy grail. 
- Product excellence and solving for users' needs is not really strongly prioritized. Instead, you feel a strong sense of ""we can't fall behind and thus are creating a copycat product from our competitor"" - see Google Home, messenger apps, Google Shopping Express. PMs are incentivized to ship products, and often things go out the door that lack product-market fit.
Advice to Management
The above cons are well-known and will not be fixed unless an SVP cares to do so, and even then, it'll only be because the market demands those changes. So, there's no point to giving advice.

Management should put more effort into behaving properly (only 1 out of 6 managers I had was an actual normal person, the rest were: vulgar sexist, work thief, politicking instead of working, threats on my life if i went to HR and so on). Those managers only got a slap on the hand and are still employed there. I got PTSD and burnouts.

As a woman, you will never thrive, you will be paid at least 10% less than your male counterparts and you will get promoted less often than males, despite hard work and equal accomplishments or more.

HR is there to drive the victim to the leave, not help it.

Ideas and processes that worked when you were in the Wojcicki’s garage in the 90s won’t work for a 100,000+ company. Grow up. Make some strategic plans.

2019-05-26, Principal Software Engineer,,"Former Employee, more than 8 years","Great company, but getting too big","Some of the best engineering talent and systems in the world. Many great challenges to work on and an incredibly diverse product portfolio. Tremendous opportunities to learn from some of the best in the industry. Gives you the opportunity to build products used by billions of people. Fantastic workplace perks and benefits.
","I was at Google for the better part of a decade, and during that time observed many changes in the company culture and leadership strategy. Generally, Google still behaves a lot like a startup, which is not really the right model for a company nearing 100,000 employees. The product strategy is poorly thought out and the culture encourages teams to spin up new product efforts without doing their homework and thinking beyond the first launch. As a result, many new products end up getting launched which have poor longevity. Google also expects that every product scale up to the billion+ user level which means that many niche products don't get the support they deserve. Finally, leadership has become increasingly disconnected from the rank-and-file of the company, and trust in HR and leadership is very low. The most obvious example of this was the $90M payment to the head of Android after being accused of sexual harassment, but there are countless other examples of recklessness and poor judgment by the company's leadership.

2019-05-25, Human Resources Operations Specialist,,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",Great benefits but using them depends on your manager,"- Health care is incredibly generous and covers so many things
- Depending on your team, the culture can be really great. However, as mentioned in the cons, its entirely up to what management you have.
- The work feels important and you can have a wide-spanning impact on people's lives.
","- Culture of teams and orgs largely depend on the management. If you have a manager who is willing to let you work from home or have a flexible schedule it's fantastic. However, not every manager or even director of your org is like this so it can be a real crap shoot.
- Leadership does a lot of talking about commitment to diversity & inclusion but takes very little active role in supporting programs to reach those goals.
- If you're not in management you often have pretty little say in the direction of your work.
Advice to Management
Spend more time and money focusing on support for culture in structured ways. Culture should not rely on whichever manager you get.

If that's your thing,"Perks like all you can eat buffet at all hours of the day, shuttle transportation is free if you're FTE and $1.50 each way if you're a TVC. Some dogs around campus available for petting. That's about it, the food quality has gone down drastically since people become entitled here and take food home for their families.
","Toxic work environment in some BUs. The leadership here are completely detached from their teams. I wouldn't call them leaders but bosses with superiority complexes. If you think FTEs are treated badly here, what about the TVCs? They do a lot of the heavy lifting and get zero recognition from uppers. TVCs know 98% of the processes yet are treated as disposable at the end of their term, leaving FTE managers to scramble to find replacements to overlap for information transferring. They are also required to document everything before they leave in hopes the new TVC will know how to handle processes, the leads never learn how to do things themselves. The dependency is not sustainable, especially not in operation type roles. It's a never ending cycle. I felt really bad for the TVCs on my team!
Advice to Management
Value your people more. Recognize and reward them more, don't continually punish. Don't criticize your peer's work, but educate them on best practices on why things should be perceived in a certain way. There is no wrong or right way of doing things, remember that. That's inhibiting creativity, ironically something that Google is known for as a brand. Please invest in your workforce, both permanent and temporary. These are the people working to serve you, they deserve to be happy, not punished.

What I love about the company is the amalgamation of great minds, collaborative work, amazing opportunities (both work and personal), flat structure, continual education and the freedom to do your work as you seem fit without having to adhere to strict processes and protocols.
","- Your core job is mundane as they tend to hire over qualified people
- They tend to promote unqualified middle managers. I have had met teams where the subordinates are much more knowledgeable and capable than the managers. This, many times made them lose great people.
- What you put hard work on might not materialize to fruition in the future as change is constant. Projects get scrapped all the time. In the end, you feel like you don't achieve much at all.
- Feels like a cult. When you work at Google, you live and breathe Google.
- Distracting work environment with so many going-ons, travels, open office, etc; hard to do work if you are not focused. 
- While they promote work life balance, the truth is, this is hard to have since there are so many projects, changes, travels and filtering of information to have a decent work life balance 
- Ridiculous amounts of unnecessary meetings

You have great people but really bad managers. You need to revisit at how you promote middle managers and directors and not just those who are visible.

2019-05-11, Stylist,,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",Great at the beginning,"Remote online styling. Flexible schedule. Work whenever you can. Fun work. Love helping when put together outfits and give style inspiration from an app. 

FYI : you have to be a self-starter, be able to teach yourself, comfortable with a learning curve. And be apart of the Tailor community to be informed about what’s going on and learn from others.
","Compensation. Lack of training and support. No one-on-one or even Zoom support. Very strange pay determinate. One week I’m at a certain tier and if I do they same work, I get lowered to another tier making my pay and time uncertain. Lots of stylist are confused and frustrated. At the beginning I could make $300 to $400 every two weeks as a side job. But now I barely make $100 every two weeks. Partly bc of the lack of motivation but also bc it doesn’t seem worth it anymore. I love this job but I can justify working for the amount of money I’m making now.

2019-05-11, Manager,"York, England, England","Current Employee, less than 1 year","Toxic environment, best for self interested entitled people","Benefits, free food, interesting problems to solve
","The perf system creates a super toxic culture. People are encouraged to serve their self interests instead of what’s best for the company or consumer. In order to get promoted, you need to launch something impactful. Sounds valid right? No, because once something launches people move on to the next big thing instead of maintaining the product.

As such, people who are rude, sexist, unpleasant and not team players get promoted. One of the Sr product managers drives his roadmap entirely based on what will get attention from marketing or in the press, so instead of building for everyone, we build based on what new idea marketing has. On top of that, he had had multiple complaints filed against him be women, and has faced no disciplinary action.

Also, this is one place where you are constantly told to “stay in your lane”. I’ve never worked anywhere where trying to fill gaps in for the team have repeatedly been not only discouraged, but dinged for. And the justification is always “it won’t help your perf.” Meaning that I can’t get raises, bonuses or promotions because I’m doing something off my official job description.

The people here are entitled and when there’s a poor performer, instead of taking care of the problem, they just shuffle them into another team. It’s like the Catholic Church.

Yeah the free food and perks are great, but it’s been a hostile work environment from day 1.

2019-05-10, Stylist,"Harrogate, England, England","Current Employee, more than 1 year",Not Worth Your Time,"Remote work & 24/7 hours
","This started off great! I loved working for Tailor in the beginning. I made great money. I usually worked whenever I got the chance and tried to answer about 25-30 questions a day which would always lead to about $60-$75. This was probably the best side hustle I've ever had especially because I already had a job on top of this one. A couple months ago the ENTIRE PAY MODEL CHANGED! I went from making about $600-$800 every pay period to about $350. When you calculate that I realized I wasn't making anymore than around $5 per hour. Completely ridiculous! They also implemented these ""tiers"" which make no sense imo. I was sending clients great suggestions and developing relationships with them and my pay reflected that yet I was put in one of the lowest tiers, so I completely stopped working. It became a waste of time even if you have nothing to do - it's still a waste of time because if you're not spending 15 min on one client due to all of the tech issues then you're waiting hours at a time for someone to pop in your queue and hopefully you snag them before the other hundreds of stylist waiting do. 

I honestly think they realized how much money they were dishing out to all of us and couldn't keep up. I noticed something was up once they started charging users for the app and forcing us to sell items. I think their ROI is far from what they projected and they're trying to cover their butts before it all goes down hill.

Shut the company down and call it quits or find some new investors, revamp the structure and pay people what they're worth.

FAANG Prestige
","Management is dangerously political. Promotions are not only hard to come by, but are not substantial enough to merit trudging through the “meritocracy” Google claims to embrace. While Google will look good on a resume, unless you are in engineering, consider this a stepping stone in your career. In fairness, competing against some of the high caliber coworkers Google has to offer will prepare you intellectually for your next career. However, be prepared to watch your peers advance their careers and make more money than you during this chapter.

2019-05-07,Anonymous,,Former Employee,Hey Google - check your recruiters. I got hustled.,"Everybody I interviewed with was smart, experienced & knowledgeable. The team was great.
","I was interviewing with Google and another company at the same time. The other company offered me a contract first. I was honest with the Google recruiters and told them I had an offer on the table. They told me Google would offer me the job b/c my interviews had gone well (I did all of the hangouts, went onsite, etc.). They even asked me what the offer was and assured me that Google would beat it. We discussed exact figures. Things were going great. We communicated multiple times, both on the phone and through email. Each time, they said an offer was coming & repeatedly told me not to sign with anyone, but I'd have to wait a few more days or ""next week"". Eventually, the other company pulled their offer. I informed the recruiters of this and they said they'd have a verbal offer for me in the coming days. By this time, we are about 2 months into the process. I've heard that it can take up to 3 months to get into Google, so I was complying with everything they said. Another week went by. Late on a Friday afternoon, I get a voicemail (not a phone call) from one of the recruiters. She says there is no offer and she cannot tell me why, but I can call her if I have questions. Of course I do, so I call. She will not pick up. I left her a voicemail, asking for her to get back to me. To this day, she is yet to return my call. Here I am, without a Google offer and I burned a bridge with a great company that actually did want me. Definitely not the experience I was expecting from a leader in our industry. Is this how Google conducts business? Thanks for nothing.

Don't just act like you care about your employees, but actually live up to it. Google plays a liberal, sensitive company, but I don't think they really care about their employees. It is the fear they might get from the public that might plummet their stock that makes them act like they care.

2019-04-24, Data Analyst,"San Francisco, CA","Current Employee, more than 5 years","Great people, perks, and benefits. Could be better for work/life balance","The pay, perks, and benefits are awesome. The food is good, and the people you work with are almost all universally at the top of their game. There is no one I work with who doesn't pull their weight or doesn't know what they are talking about (like other jobs I have had).

The offices are really good and it's a fun place to work. I don't know any other job where I can get what I have here.
","Google has a reputation for being different, but in a lot of ways it is still a big, hierarchical, company. Work can be stressful and lead to long hours and the amount of work can be hard to manage. The promotion and review system is really opaque. It's sometimes hard to feel like your job is being appreciated.

Work/life balance is not great, and they offer a lot of perks to help with stress and mental health (like massages, 25 counseling sessions a year, discounts to the Headspace app, meditation rooms, etc.) but in practice it seems like lip service. When you have 50+ hours of work per week on your plate, it's pretty hard to cut out early to take a walk around the block or grab a massage. A lot of people are here for a long time, but around the 5-6 year mark a lot of people burn out.
Advice to Management
Walk the walk if you're going to talk the talk. Nice offices and cafes are nice, but I would rather have some more headcount on my team, or a shift in management perspective, so I can disconnect at night and not stress so much.

2019-04-20, Customer Engineer,"Denver, CO","Current Employee, more than 1 year",Google Cloud's culture is being purged,"All the perks of Google -- great benefits, free food, smart people, great tech, lots of resources, etc.
","Google Cloud management is creating the same authoritarian, highly political, uncaring culture that is common at many other companies. Work/life balance is nearly non-existent and, as a result, there are increasing levels of burnout within the organization. Recognition/reward for the high amount of effort employees are putting in is terribly out of alignment. The majority of the sales force doesn't hit quota as targets are set by those in the bubble of Silicon Valley who don't understand the difference between Cloud-native organizations and Fortune 500 enterprises. Opportunities for advancement are minimal as these positions are typically being filled from the outside including a healthy proportion of insiders bringing in their former peers while overlooking those who have worked hard and sacrificed for years.
Advice to Management
Stop recreating an AWS/Microsoft/Oracle/IBM cultural clone. People left those companies for a reason and now are bemoaning what Google Cloud is turning into.

","Prior to Google, I have had a long and proud engineering career. Passed the notorious Google interview and got the offer at T6 like a breeze. Was hired to rescue a big broken software component, without any a-priori awareness. (was never told so, before and after joining). Was promised to have 6 months of learning (like all Nooglers do, regardless of level), but by 9 months, despite tons of good work already went in with measurable improvements, was already criticized by the manager, f2f, word exactly: ""do you feel it a shame that xxx is still broken?"". Manager was a nerdy, self-eccentric, and ruthless ""genius"". Here is his favorite behaveour: in private conversations he says: "" you are the TL, you should have a vision, should be the role model, and should lead the team"". In the public, however, he does everything he can to knock you down as a TL! He would refute the comments you post on junior team member's code view, for very insignificant reasons. He would criticize & question your own code change in all the ways he can, making it stay in review for 2-months, without any significant functional changes (Yes it was working from day 1). Yet, he comes back to criticize hard your code velociy, citing the 2-month code review as a critical evidence! He assigns some one from a remote location to work on this component, without even notifying you! You see old teammates who worked on this component for many years leaving the group. Finally, you see your manager himself also leaving the company.

- Work / life balance and personal development are heavily encouraged
- Tech and brand are well established, but there's still room for growth and impact
","Most of the cons come from the fact that the product team I work on is very large and spreads across multiple offices. A lot of product teams are pretty large and cross-functional.

2019-04-03, Software Engineer,"Sunnyvale, CA","Current Employee, more than 1 year",Management does not care about you,"+1 star for the good perks.
","I left Google Cloud almost 2 years ago to join a different org in Google. My experience in Cloud was disappointing, and not a day goes by where I don't regret leaving earlier. My current team, while not perfect, treats me with respect; it really goes to show how huge the variation can be across Google.

Here are many lessons I've learned in my previous team which I hope will benefit you:

- If your project is not listed as part of an OKR (Objective & Key Result), no one cares about your project. While most managers will make sure you have a project that can grow your skills and career, many won't and may even try to mislead you into believing your project is more meaningful than it is. Voice your concerns, and firmly ask for a meaningful project. As an L3 engineer, it is not your duty to come up with projects, so your manager has the responsibility to find a good one for you.

- If you feel your career is going nowhere, transfer to a different team (which can be done without manager approval after 1 year). Do not fall into the sunk costs trap of refusing to leave because you didn't get what you wanted out of your 1 year on the team. For my first half year at Google, I fixed bugs, set up system health monitoring, did deprecations, refactorings, migrations, etc but never had a genuine project. I thought that after a half year of BS work, I would be given better opportunities. Then, I was assigned a monolithic project. I worked long hours to move the project forward. However, our sibling team repeatedly bailed on their responsibilities in the project, and I had to continuously adapt the design accordingly. Eventually, it became clear that our sibling team was not going to contribute anything, and I felt I could no longer leave the team because the project would require significantly more work than initially anticipated. After one year of working on this project, our management decided not to launch without any basis. If you're not treated well after a year, don't think your coworkers and boss will suddenly start treating you well in your second year or even third year. Don't be idealistic or loyal because Google was rated #1 in employee happiness; it's a big company and not every team is the same.

- Management is perfectly fine wasting 1+ years of your time rather than have an honest conversation about the relevance of your project. On my previous team, this was the norm, not the exception. See the previous bullet point for one example, but this had also happened to my next project, as well as many of my coworkers' projects. The reality is: Managers don't face as much penalty for cancelled projects as engineers. Some managers have 30 reports working under them on a variety of projects, and the performance evaluation has a word limit and a limit of 5 projects. If a project fails, managers can just add more words to the other projects. However, as an entry-level engineer, you may only be working on 0-2 projects, so a cancelled project is much more detrimental to you. The same applies for cross-team collaborations. Make sure the partnering team has a tangible investment in your project. People have a tendency to promise commitments for a reputation boost, but when it comes to actually doing the work, they will flake if there's nothing in it for them. One way to reduce the chance of your project getting abandoned is to make sure your project is part of your team's (or the partnering team's) OKRs. Managers have an explicit responsibility to fulfill their OKRs.

- In 1-on-1 meetings, do not believe everything your manager says about your career path. Actions speak louder than words. Has your manager been giving you ample project opportunities for growth? Are you getting opportunities for impact comparable to your peers? If the answer to these questions is no, you're not on a strong path to promotion, no matter what your manager says. At Google, performance evaluations are done at a cycle of every half-year. In my second cycle, my manager told me I performed well, and was on track to getting promoted in the next cycle. In the following cycle though, my manager said it may take another 1 year before I would get promoted, even though I never received any indication I had gone off-track. While I would imagine most managers are honest about your career growth, some aren't. By telling you that you have a chance at promotion in the next cycle even if it's not true, they have effectively kept you for another half-year and postponed any consequences for their dishonesty until then. Also, it does not matter if you're assigned an unimportant project or your coworkers failed to do their part. No one is going to say: ""Johnny's project failed to launch, but Johnny did an excellent job and deserves to be promoted anyway"" because it implies someone else should be blamed, and no one is willing to make that sacrifice for you. Also, the promotion committee frankly doesn't care; they need to see measurable impact because that's one of the criteria for promotion, regardless of whose fault it is.

2019-03-26, Software Engineer,"Mountain View, CA","Current Employee, more than 5 years",Excellent place to work,"* Scale! In Google you can improve the products used by billions of people, or shape the future of the entire industry. Few companies can boast that;
* Outstanding developer and production infrastructure;
* Great culture and supportive peers;
* Tech management done right - usually your managers are your senior peers who are incredibly helpful and have first-hand knowledge of your area;
* Good compensation and perks.
","* Things may move slowly - even the smallest changes and experiments take a long time;
* In established and seasoned products, your contributions might look small and negligible at first;
* You mostly work with internal tools, and have no idea what's happening in the wild.

2019-03-26, Senior Operations Program Manager,"Dublin, Dublin","Current Employee, more than 5 years",Best place I've ever worked,"- Very smart people
- Perks (free food, gym, swimming pool, snacks, ...)
- Ability to make the role your own (in some roles) and start your own projects
- 20%-time roles in whatever area you want to develop
- Self-started / self-motivated environment
- If you want to explore other jobs and are open to relocate, there are lots of opportunities.
- Multicultural environment with people from all over the world
- Easy to make new friends (at least in Dublin)
- Quite flexible (work from home, arrive when you want, etc.)
","- A lot of people want to join the company because of the company and not because of the role, so there's a lot of over qualified people doing things they don't really want to do.
- Because of the perks it's difficult to leave the company even after losing motivation.
- When a manager under performs, often they just move them to a different team, instead of moving them out of people management. 
- It can be very hard to relocate to countries outside the headquarters.
- The atmosphere in Dublin is amazing, but in smaller offices you don't feel the Google vibe.
- It's easy to get away with performing at 50-60% of your real capacity after some time in a role.
Advice to Management
- Keep hiring brilliant people, but encourage them to move to another position once they feel too comfortable. 
- Don't move poor people managers around. Move them into Individual Contributor roles.

2019-03-25, Sales,"Zürich, Zürich","Current Employee, more than 3 years","Google is great, but stay away from Google Cloud","Incredibly smart, talented and diverse colleagues in the sales and sales engineering teams. This is Google, so the perks are amazing, the offices are gorgeous and the company does some incredible things across the portfolio. It is a bit like in the movie about Google, called The Internship.
","Sadly, all the cool things you heard about Google do not apply to the Google Cloud organisation. A mess of mindless micromanagement, by self absorbed, arrogant, old-guard types. Everybody manages up, but does not share back down. This is easily the most old fashioned sales management team I have ever experienced. The Cloud sales and sales engineering organisations spend a ridiculous amount of time focused inward on things that reduce time with the customer, while offering no benefit to the customer. Combine that with regular fire drills, where EMEA management needs some information (without communicating why) and everyone! scrambles to provide it, with local management just passing things along, all the while pressuring you about your quota. Speaking of: If you are not in retail, don't even think about having a chance to make quota. Most enterprise customers see no reason to work with Google Cloud and even the sales engineers (CEs) haven't found a reasonable answer to the ""why Google Cloud?"" question that gets asked by almost every account. The new leadership under Thomas Kurian is implementing the ""strategy"" of throwing more sales people at the problem, and trying to play catch up on traditional workloads that make money, but where AWS and Azure are years ahead of Google. Not very creative or visionary. Publicly stating this, is even more damning. All of the DACH sales leadership comes from companies that have lost in the public cloud market (HP, Vmware, etc), but bring their mindset of traditional software sales with them. Finally there is a mix of arrogance (we are Google, we know best) and naïveté (if we build it, customers will come) that permeates the organisation. Instead of adapting industry best practices around sales processes, literally hundreds of people internally spend valuable time in creating over engineered processes for large deals that almost never materialise. It is becoming harder and harder to consult customer on GCP, because I'm starting to believe that the company will get bored of it, if it doesn't turn a profit in the next 24 months and will abandon it.
Advice to Management
Read ""How Google works"" and ""Work rules!"" written by former leaders at Google, and maybe you will realise that you have killed everything that makes Google great, and that customer love about the company, in the Google Cloud org.

","You'll go from having 50 clients available to speak with to less than 5. Over time the list starts dwindling and Tailor will claim it's because not as many users are logged in. That would make sense for 2-3 hours; it doesn't however make sense all day long for weeks on end. Highly frustrating and difficult to maintain a steady income. Additionally they keep changing things so it becomes increasingly difficult to create relationships with clients.
