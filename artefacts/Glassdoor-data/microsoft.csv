2021-10-01,Anonymous,,"Current Employee, less than 1 year",Still unsure how to feel,"I worked at a startup before Microsoft. There are a lot more hoops to jump through to get things done, but overall I'm enjoying it. They pay well and the benefits are great. The resources Microsoft has for professional development is awesome too. I think my manager really cares about work life balance and encourages us to take time off if we need it.
","I think it depends on your manager or section of the company. I guess the biggest con for me can be that North star metrics ruling over your every thought and action to the point where you may end up doing something that isn't great but it really beefs up the metric.

","Too many decision makers, politics, non-collaboration between silos, difficult to drive impact or do the right thing, leadership often disregards the recommendations of their teams, mandates for coming into the office vs working remotely, illegal vaccine mandates, frequent re-organizations without assessing operational efficiencies or keeping people aligned with their natural skills and talents, poor long-term decision making
Advice to Management
Do a thorough assessment of your GMs and VPs for sociopathy/empathy. They often don't reflect company values and their frequent disregard for their teams' recommendations/efforts wastes $millions and has a huge, negative impact on morale.

Rethink how you do re-orgs, which can often feel like hostile take-overs of organizational resources, disrupt productivity and creativity, and decrease trust and morale. 

Invest in better cross-company collaboration and long-term thinking and decision-making.

","Pay gap against other companies is expanding. Work life balance is not very good and is reflected in the dramatic increase in people leaving the company. Like every other big company, do not expect Microsoft to look out for you. They care about what effects the shareholder and nothing else. Do not assume they care about people or ethics unless it benefits them.
Advice to Management
The top is bloated with management that is too political and is always demonstrating a lack of ability to work across divisions. Most middle to senior leadership are terrified to make a decision so nothing ever moves fast. When it does it is usually a major reorganization that slows down productivity and kills moral. Recruiting is the worst I have ever seen in a major company.

2021-09-27, Explore Internship Program,"Bellevue, WA","Current Employee, less than 1 year",Pretty decent program.,"Overall it was a decent program. I wouldn't call it stellar, but it was ok.

My team was super cool and friendly.
","As an international student, I didn't appreciate waiting a whole month to receive my relocation bonus, as that's what would have allowed me to find somewhere to stay, as opposed to crashing on a friend's couch. Bold of them to assume I have family to live with during my internship like the domestic kids did.

Being virtual made asking for help hard. It's easier to drop by your workmate's office and show them why your code isn't working as opposed to having them drop everything and hop on a teams call.

Doing my internship virtually also made all the events a little subpar. I definitely would have preferred watching Sofia Rodriguez live as opposed to over a live stream. Just didn't hit the same. Felt like youtube tbh.

Not a lot of training on the best coding practices, or Microsoft's secret sauce. I basically YouTubed everything I needed to learn to get the job done. I had expected a little more structure from a program for people with little to no prior experience.
Advice to Management
Pay the relocation for international students earlier.

Include an explore academy and actually teach explore interns stuff.

- Some cool projects to work on.
- You get to work on products that are used globally.
- Decent healthcare.
- Stock price is decent right now.
","- They believe that raising leads and managers from the ranks will always work. The result is managers and leads who don't know how to manage a diverse set of employees and instead simply look to forward their career. Managers can be caustic and will happily play favorites.
- Pay is below comparable companies
- Work life balance is given lip service but never actually improved.
- While working remote, people are often impossible to get a hold of unless you nag nag nag. Your management will yell at you for not being creative enough about how you nag people if you tell your management you're blocked by someone else.
- Be ready to be combative with management. They won't always help you, argue for you or be understanding. Some leads will be good, many will not.
Advice to Management
Train good managers who actually care about the success of their employees. Come down HARD on people playing favorites. Train management to handle feedback in a positive way. An IC giving feedback & concerns to a manager shouldn't be met with condescending, dismissive and off-putting responses. I felt crushed on a regular basis, putting my life into my work and getting dumped on with zero recognition of my efforts. Asking to talk about feedback and being told ""We're not going to talk specifics. Accept the feedback and move on"" is unacceptable.

Business Outlook
Pros
Leadership values the opinions of the workforce here where you'll constantly see them refer to polls and workgroup advocacies.
Cons
It's a huge company and they rely on impact to rate performance. This impact mindset means those who write better performance writeups are bound to have higher performance appraisals than those who may be working harder but are less skilled in boasting their accomplishments and/or claiming the work of others. Also, the best way to career advancement will typically come from a career change, internal moving happens frequently.
Advice to Management
Advocate for your employees and be willing to listen openly, everyone's position and experience are different.

You can maintain a healthy work life balance as long as you are not workaholic. This won't affect your growth as long as you do your best.
The environment helps you thrive by giving you the opportunities to closely work with teams abroad no matter what your level is. You also get a good chance to keep learning and developing your skills.
Most of the senior leadership people are very appreciating, inclusive and encouraging.
Managers do welcome people's decisions to relocate to other places and join other teams (as long as the process was transparent).
","Probably the compensation would need to get a bit higher to stack up against the competition.
Given the size of the lab, the opportunity to grow beyond the principal level is close to zero.
Senior leadership needs more technical coverage and depth. Also they need more behavioral skills to be able to manage the people reporting to them.

- Due to employee pressure, it is trending towards Diversity and Inclusion, but still has a long way to go.
","- Front line employees are underpaid compared to leadership. 
- The salaries and bonuses of employees through principal band are the first to take a hit on a less successful year (or even if leadership is worried about the future), and senior management reaps the rewards on good years with the only trickle down being maintaining just below market rate salaries.
- They consistently pay slightly less than their main competitors, because they sell their culture and benefits as worth more.

I've worked at Microsoft for the majority of my professional career in several different PM roles (technical and non-technical) across a few teams. By and large I've been treated well, had wonderful colleagues, and benefited greatly from the opportunities available to me. Who your manager is matters a lot. The company culture does seem to be improving and evolving under Satya's lead, reducing some of the competition between departments that my colleagues indicated was common when I first joined.

","The work culture is horrible especially in the azure team. 
The HR and finance teams are outsourced with no check on them, so if you've any issue with the salary, reimbursement or HR your queries won't get resolved for months with no one to complain to.
The salaries are much below industry standard, with little increments leading to brain drain. 
Most of talented staff from india has either quit or moved to US.
The senior management is India full of people, who do nothing and create a toxic culture for the teams under them. 
Won't get to learn anything, as a fresher.
Advice to Management
Have a proper team to handle employee's concern instead of outsourcing it to random companies who don't respond to employees. 

Create a more hostile working environment, otherwise brain drain will continue. The company won't be able to attract talent just for brand name

2021-09-03, Azure Specialist,"Dublin, Dublin","Current Employee, more than 3 years","Microsoft is great, Dublin office not necessarily.","1. Opportunity to learn -> you can learn from many interesting and technical people, get free certifications, develop some new skills - that is undeniable. Microsoft supports all kind of learning or personal development which is really cool.

2. Microsoft in your CV. It really helps :)

3. Getting to know some amazing people. Dublin office is huge and there's loads of great individuals worth hanging out with!

4. Awesome office, including:
- great food (although not free) 
- great cafe
- music room
- yoga room
- ping pong
- chill out areas

5. Huge amount of materials to learn (not only related to IT), possibility of getting your MBA or other study course funded - super cool!
","This is only related to Digital Sales in Dublin Office!

1. Salaries are joke. Comparing to Google, Facebook, Hubspot, Twitter and other big players in Ireland, Microsoft pays less. Sometimes even 20-30%. They will tell you that 'they're adjusting salaries to market' but it's not really a thing. If you wanna earn a lot of money (especially in sales) go elsewhere. Negotiation/salary increase/promotion is rather symbolic and the promotion process has been criticized many times by employees yet nothing much has changed. There's a bigger change of getting promoted if you're 'visible' than getting rewarded for your hard work. That means there's a very little chance to get a proper salary increase regardless if you're a senior or not. Fun fact: Even MS managers tend to say - if you want a raise, quit and come back after 2 years. 

2. Taxation in Ireland is ridiculously high -> keep that in mind when considering an offer. Income tax is around 40% and bonuses are taxed 50%! Big chunk of sales salary is a bonus... so do the math. There's nothing much Microsoft does in order to change it (even though they could, there are special tax schemes that, neither you get any benefits while paying highest taxes in the country. (No free healthcare, no public transport, no free childcare + ridiculously expensive rentals starting from 1700EUR/a month for 1bed apartment).
 
3. No career growth opportunities in Digital Sales. As a few other people mentioned already, Irish managers are always first to consider, regardless of their experience. That makes it really difficult for anyone else becoming a manager. Other than first line manager position, there's not much available (unless you wanna change position/workload but that's not too much of a change now is it. Finding a job outside of Digital Sales is very challenging and can take years (although it's possible).

4. Visibility Bubble. You'll keep seeing and hearing the same faces getting rewarded/awarded/highlighted etc.
Advice to Management
1. Be truly diverse -> Hire more non-irish folks as managers!
2. Stop the 'visibility game' once and for all.

Longtime Microsoft fan-boy here... Microsoft needs to have faith in some of their more edge IP... too often they have backed off of great ideas only for other companies to swoop in and profit on the market Microsoft hatched. (Looking at you maps, smart phones, tablets, and wearable devices.) I fear they're going to short-change HoloLens the same way.

During my time there, I worked with exceptional leaders, peers, and my direct reports kept me on my toes making me a better leader. Other things I liked included:

Supportive leadership team and team mates 
Smart and caring people
Great benefits and perks - Especially during COVID, Microsoft offered excellent benefits!
Lots of professional development opportunities and resources
","Lots of meetings and work to get done in a standard 40-hour work week. Leaders are supportive of finding balance, pushing back, and asking for help...but sometimes there's no help and you just have to weigh the benefits of your real options: working more hours or lettings balls drop.
Advice to Management
Don't under-level people when they join the team (internally or externally).
Protect your people's time from meeting overload. 
Don't overload people managers with too many customers/ICs so that they can build deep relationships and knowledge.

- Depending on the area, there are a lot of interesting positions and cutting edge research.
- Diversity and Inclusion is central
","- No dedicated QA. Developer engineers are in charge of testing, they have to dogfood internal software, and often be on call (in case they work on an Azure service).
- Communication flow among teams within the same company (but on different projects) is difficult and depends on personal connections, or hardly searchable wikis. This can lead to developers reinventing the wheel, because they can't easily use the knowledge from other teams.

2021-08-22, Hardware Engineer,Tel Aviv-Yafo,"Current Employee, more than 5 years","Very bad management, nothing as seems from the outside","The company has many divisions, large facilities and all means for employees to fulfill themselves and make a great business impact by technology.

Salaries are good, facilities are top-notch, many activities encouraging creative thinking.

I believe that career opportunities should be great, but it really depends on how supportive the direct manager is.
","Nothing is like what was offered prior to signup.
There isn't any governing about promotions, bonuses, rewards, etc. 
Whoever is close to the direct management benefits from all Microsoft has to offer regardless of their impact, technical skills, or efforts. 
Very often managers make things very personal. Giving the employee the minimum possible under the terms of Microsoft, while taking advantage of many ambiguities to their favor. 

Paternity leave and annual vacation days are a must, however, they will justify the demand from an employee to keep working while on vacation by ""Critical urgent needs"". Enforcing employees to cancel already ordered vacations, day or two before the set date, leaving the employee to bear the costs, while other employees are prioritized and are allowed to have long vacations over the same period of time.

No clear pathway for career development and promotions. Managers will interpret level advancement criteria by their perspective just in order to prevent certain employees from advancing their careers. Likewise, providing false negative feedback with made-up failures, to sabotage the employee's chances of changing role in the organization, leaving the employee the only option of leaving out.

Needless to say, none of the pledges are never fulfilled, always with ""perfect"" pretexts.
Advice to Management
Refresh procedures amongst direct management who are surely not capable and not suitable to manage people.

O nome Microsoft agrega a qualquer currículo.
","A Microsoft, maior empresa de tecnologia do mundo também é uma das mais burocráticas para se trabalhar. Existem dezenas de acrônimos, processos burocráticos e aprovações para se fazer qualquer coisa! Todos os funcionários e vendors precisam saber de compliance, privacy, finance, independentemente da area em que trabalham. Tudo muda o tempo inteiro e o excesso de informação atrapalha qualquer processo de aprendizagem. As pessoas são extremamente workaholics e isso é o “normal” de lá. 
A cultura de self-service (onde você não é orientado/treinado a como fazer, mas sim a ir atrás das pessoas e informações) é um grande problema, principalmente para recém-contratados.
É uma empresa para quem já possui muita experiência, aos que estão em início de carreira, podem encontrar problemas para se adaptar.

Pay can be very good depending on your role and the way your territories are structured. Diversity and Inclusion, environmental awareness and Time Off are all great and encouraged.
","Confusion at the start of every year - account shifts are made in advance, but quotas and other numbers are not, so you don't even know what your target is until Q1 is almost over. And now they're making 'refinements' to quotas mid-year, so if you're doing well in the first half expect to see some increase in the second.
Advice to Management
Management needs to understand that not all segments work like Enterprise. If you have a subsegment, like Small-Medium Corp and SLG, expecting the timing of opportunities, buying cycles and seasonality to match Enterprise is a recipe for high stress and demotivation of your sales teams. Likewise, you cannot expect an account exec or specialist with 160 accounts to do deep dives into customer business the same way an Enterprise team can do with their 3-5 accounts. 

Also, we say we lead with empathy and encourage people to speak up, but I've seen firsthand how a tenured rep who is considered a Rockstar can go onto a Director's hit list and have their job threatened after one isolated instance of missing some details on a pipeline review.

My first role post MBA was at Microsoft and it was a great first entry into the industry. Managers were supportive of my skills and helped me learn and grow, to a point. PMs who define themselves as Product Managers in Technology need to be vary careful about the PM roles they select to work on within Microsoft, to ensure they reflect the skills they want to expand on in the industry.
","Microsoft does not do career evaluations/reviews on Product Manager skills. Instead Program Managers are a catch all of Project Management, Technical Program Manager skills, with limited exposure and oportuntiy to develop Business Strategy, pricing, market research etc. that is typically needed for Product Manager & leadership roles in other companies, this makes it challenging to grow as a product manager and stay industry relevant while still working at Microsoft.

No cohesive strategy or leadership, things go in circles based on who is in power in your organization for a whopping 9 to 18 months, you can kick butt in your performance and you will still only get slightly higher than average rewards, promotions to the higher levels are entirely politically based, 9 times out of 10 they hire in higher levels instead of promoting from within, they spend millions on consultants to come in and recommend what you've already been advocating for months, teams spend a lot of time (corporate) virtue signaling but if you step back and look at their actions you see they don't actually live it.

Too much of kiss up culture, boss worshiping, not very balanced workforce
Advice to Management
a holistic leadership from diverse background of services, sales, consulting is needed. Microsoft has had to evolve from office license selling and windows OS selling to more business specific solutions. But the mentality of leadership and teams below is still the same. They still operate at license mentality and no client centricity when it comes to business needs. They make 90% margins because of monopoly and being a large player. They killed Nokia precisely because the inclusiveness as a culture is missing. They have an overarching outlook to consume everyone with their own inbuilt culture. Very less outward focused to build their own culture. So poor balance.

2021-07-28, Software Engineer,Prague,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",Poor work life balance in D365 for Marketing Prague,"Lots of resources to learn and progress in your professional career. Lots of projects which that allow virtually anyone to find something that the like to do.
","The D365 for Marketing organization is run like a startup. High level managers openly embrace it and say that it is a good thing that we are driven by urgency.

Work life balance is bad in many levels. Starting from having calls after your EOD with your US buddies, to having to work at night or weekends as this is what everybody else does. This means that if you do not do it you are seen as an underperformer.

There is virtually no time for formal training. Even though management gives the official message that it is encouraged, in the day-to-day pressure to deliver tasks is so high that telling your manager that you want to do a soft-skills training would sound like a joke and you would be seen as an irresponsible person. This is evident when you are told ""Please feel free to do the training, just bear in mind that you are a Senior Engineer and we have lots of work to do"". 

And the worst sadly, is that these situations are not specific to any particular time (e.g. before a product release), but they sustain in time. It is very usual to hear people complaining about the same off the record.

2021-07-28, Cloud Solutions Architect,,"Former Employee, less than 1 year",Unbelievably Woke Company,"Phenomenal learning environment, great software and services solutions, ok compensation, very smart colleagues, some growth opportunities.
","The company will do EVERYTHING on their power not to give you a raise. In fact, even if you get promoted you won't get one. They are also intractably woke, and everything seems to be about diversity, inclusion, LGBT and race issues - if you are a woman (or if you belong to any minority, for that matter), you're definitely in the right place to rise very quickly. The pace is intense, which can be good and bad. There was no HR department on my building (in fact, it seemed that every HR function was concentrated in Singapore). Management is relatively poor (although I was personally happy with all my management tree all the way to Satya), but this is fine, as Microsoft hires extremely smart, hardworking and self-managed people.
Advice to Management
Get real! You're not here to change the world! You're running a business, so treat your employees well and fairly (including on compensation and benefits) without resorting to favoring minorities (I know a case of a competent candidate that was not hired solely for being a man, and HR didn't even hide it). We also don't need a new newsletter every other day about LGBT issues, women on the workplace, or the likes of it.

2021-07-21, Content Developer/Writer,,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",I don't know about you but this place is exhausting,"Excellent medical coverage benefits!
Good benefits overall when compared with most other companies. Most people do not take a look at the depth of benefits that MSFT provides or take advantage of all of them (1200/year for wellness/hobbies, discounted eyeglasses at their internal eye doctor place, you get deep prescription drug discounts if filling at their pharmacy for example). Awesome other perks like use of the maker space, free yoga and wellness programs, even relationship or nutrition coaching.
Opportunity to learn a ton in a short amount of time - 1 year at MSFT is equivalent to many more years at a mid-size business. You'll have access to a lot of learning resources online, through their library, etc - it's as much learning as you can cram into your brain although there may not be enough time in the day to prioritize it. 
Most people are very smart and talented, tends to be a very driven, results-oriented team of people which can be fun and motivated
Excellent work life balance on my particular team but can vary depending on your team (Azure is not great at it for example) 
Compensation is not the highest in the industry but it is in the top 5, stock is on the up and up so financially the last year or so has been really advantageous.
","The main takeaway here is that this place is really stressful. Expect to grow some gray hair and also get good at managing your own stress. 
In my organization planning takes 8 weeks of a 16 week quarter which is totally ridiculous.
If someone leaves the team, their work is just reallocated to everyone who is still there, backfills during the pandemic have been rare in my organization. This has led to a lot of people being frustrated and burnt out. 
The sexism and racism is still real despite major efforts on the D&I front. Too many people who don't get it are in major leadership roles. Making actual progress on D&I issues can be insanely slow due to organizational size and lack of will. Senior Leadership Team (Satya etc) have a vision and want the right things, middle layers of management either don't care or might want to care but are so busy it's the last thing to ever get done. 
Review/Connect system has undergone changes and is supposed to be casual but isn't, ways to advance at the company are very murky. The old ""make alliances with the cool kids and promote yourself by sending status mails about your projects to look promotable"" is the best strategy to get ahead and that is unfortunate as it means a lot of the people in management are good at either manipulating people or ass-kissing but not actually good managers or good at their jobs. It is less ""stab people in the back to get ahead"" than it was but paths for advancement can be limited and confusing. 
Retention numbers of minorities, which they do not often publicize, are low.
Every person who was the best at their job on my team has left for Google or Facebook or to start their own company. Not sure MSFT is retaining best-in-industry talent (possibly because comp is better at other companies). 
Priority in my particular team is to make ""good enough"" solutions rather than great solutions. It can be frustrating to work with a lot of people who just want to keep their heads down and do whatever is easiest rather than what will end up being right for customers or right for long-term product development. Long term planning ability at MSFT is limited because changes are so frequent to organizations. 
Onboarding is non-existent, MSFT is a sink or swim environment. You might get an outdated OneNote with some notes from someone but I would not expect more than that as someone joining!
Amount of time spent fighting fires is more than spent on regular job tasks. There can be interdepartmental sparring for resources, attention, because two incapable dudes who somehow became managers feel like it, etc. which can be frustrating.
Advice to Management
Promote people who are talented at what they do and have actual emotional capacity to lead teams
Realize that employees are burned out and adjust expectations accordingly
Do not make all the minorities at your company do your D&I work for you, it's insulting and annoying.

Pay is good for the industry, and benefits are great. The stock has performed remarkably well for a company that was written off as ""the next IBM"" just a few years ago.
","If you want Fortune 50 benefits, you will work Fortune 50 hours. You will encounter and have to navigate politics, reorganizations, managers good and bad (sometimes both at once), and the sacrifice of time spent with family, friends, or hobbies. Some people can balance it all, but for the mere mortals, working at Microsoft (or any highly competitive corporation) means sacrifice as well as great personal gain.

2021-07-19, Customer Success Account Manager,,Current Employee,It’s ok,"Working for Microsoft has its benefits.. the stocks, employee stock purchase program, and benefits are all top notch.

Many of the people that I work with are amazing! Especially on the CSAM team.

Diversity and inclusion is a priority at Microsoft, and I feel it at a corporate level (although not necessarily within my organization- leadership in GAMD).
","Unfortunately, the list of cons is quite extensive. On the team that I am on, work life balance is non-existent. 

Pay is below market average, and incredibly low compared to other roles within Microsoft.

Our tools are terrible. Most of our tools are designed in-house, and often don’t work.

Partners and customers are terrible! I’ve seen a trend the last few years that our customers and partners are becoming more aggressive and disrespectful. It is making it challenging to work with some of them.

Support can be challenging, and the customers and partners will let you know it.

The biggest challenge is when someone leaves the team, their responsibilities get divided out to the remaining team members. We have some teams that have been down almost a third of their staff- which means the rest of the team is responsible for picking up the slack.

","You will likely work on legacy tech that isn’t all that exciting or “modern”. Many large successful services are maintained by thousands of engineers toiling away on an ancient legacy monolithic codebase. Making changes take a lot of time to get to production due to over engineered paranoid levels of gates and flights. It’s not a web app running in the cloud. It is the cloud.
Advice to Management
Find a way to create an exciting work place for developers that want to use latest modern development tools. We build great tech for customers to use on azure but our own code bases and engineering systems especially deployment are just painful to work with and supported by the blood sweat and tears of oncall engineers being paged.

Business Outlook
Pros
Work \ Life balance, Welfare, culture I could go on but I would run out of space! 

The main point from me is, it is when you have a problem in your life the company shows what it is made off and I could not have go any more support if I tried, from management and team mates. 

There is access to as much training as you can manage to fit in, there is support for new ideas no matter how junior you are. The pace can be a little fast at times but this is more than recognised by the management and take an active part in making sure it is not too much to handle.
Cons
I only wish I was as smart as some of the others! Compensation is not as good as some of the others in the industry but is is not too bad.

Good Parental and assistance leaves

Many opportunities for lateral movement (much harder for promotions)

","Irish Sales directors like to hire Irish employees as managers from other departments (Ops, Engineering...) rather just promote Sellers

They have cut a deal with the Irish gov to not optimise the Income taxes of the employees (so Microsoft employees pay more in taxes than other companies by default)

Promotions are given for political reasons (they massively hired sellers from Egypt just to silence an ex-employee - who was rehired as a sales manager in Dublin - has threatened HR if they do not hire his vendor employees)

No black or African sellers (Except those of Egypt)
Advice to Management
Stop the politics, be more inclusive, promote people based on meritocracy and not Irishness

* Decent Work Life Balance but completely up to employee to manage
* Customer First mindset - everything starts with the customer
* Most teams have a collaborative environment
* The new Microsoft under Satya's leadership is really awesome!
* New Performance Management system does not force managers to label employees with a rating, or meet a bell curve/forced distribution as a result managers are motivated to keep people discussions very positive and healthy, and not a blood bath like it was several years ago.
","* Some teams are very fast paced (Azure) and can be overwhelming. Work Life Balance has a potential to go out the window so you have to own/manage it.
* Promotions are hard to come by at Principal/Partner levels.
* Newer employees make more $$ than those who have stayed for long (which I believe is true everywhere). Employees who do not want to lose their edge on earning potential may be tempted to leave the company to other FAANG/Tech companies and come back (boomerang) at higher levels/compensation in a few years, which is quite common.

- Very slow moving for projects and initiatives, so much red tape.
- Sometimes too structured, tend to be risk averse.
- Career development not driven by management typically, no clear path or direction.

Those ""current goals"" are usually the sweet spot on a venn diagram between Microsofts ""current goals"" and those of the customer...which is not what the customer is concentrated on.

2021-06-09, Software Engineer,"Redmond, WA","Former Employee, more than 1 year","Lots of good, lots of bad","In Redmond, M$ has a pretty campus with a variety of architectures for its buildings. Compensation and benefits are ok, not at the level of FAANG but better than most companies (think $105k-110k salary for a new college grad, or more). They provide nice ergonomic setups like an ergonomic keyboard, ergo chairs, and adjustable-height desks so you can sit or stand. Plenty of phone rooms/conf rooms with whiteboards. Free drinks from water (obviously) to coffee, milk, Pacific northwest sparkling water, and soda.

Tech is not as good as FAANG either, but still not bad compared to other technologies -- I wrote microservices in C# / .NET Framework and/or .NET Core / Azure. Some parts are frustrating with a lot of footguns (esp Nuget and the .net Framework, and sometimes hard-to-debug memory issues), but C# is still a great language -- it provides a lot out of the box like functional programming, monads, closures, plus it's flexible enough to do low-level (C) stuff if you want.

There is some opportunity for learning and growth. Quite a bit of flexibility in when you work and there are a few good resources for learning such as free online tech courses and an onsite library.

Work-life balance depends on the team but you can coast if you want, maybe not even make it to 40 hours a week if you don't have too much work.
","People are very siloed, defensive and petty/bickering. Lots of people are just trying to keep their job, maybe because they need M$ sponsorship for visas, citizenship etc. Lots of fingerpointing/blame culture. This especially hurts with the pager duty / oncall rotation because when an issue happens nobody wants themselves or their team to take the blame, everyone deflects issues, etc. I think it's because of pressure from higher up (anywhere from skip managers to VP level) but not sure. There is a wave of culture change under Satya that seems to be helping but I would check back in 10 years to see if things have healed.

On-call duty as an engineer is terrible. You typically face at least 1 outage from another team every week and you will see multiple outages that don't affect your team, it's very discouraging to see. You will have to fight other teams when you ask them what's going on and they blame it on your service. Also issues always tend to happen right in the middle of the night instead of during the day because we depend on teams in other parts of the globe. You are guaranteed to get woken up at least twice every time you go on call.

The Partner Center team sucks. The culture is basically just to keep your head down and not cause issues. There are no good engineer role models, and nobody knows our own technology very well.

Company values only matter around performance review time (~6 months).

As a young person it is hard to make friends with anybody except for other new grads/early in career people. Everyone else tends to keep their head down and not take any ownership or responsibility.

If you work really hard and apply yourself you will get promoted a little faster (maybe 1 year). Otherwise you can coast and do little work/bare minimum work and get promoted every 2-3 years. Not much incentive to do the former but my manager pressured me to work hard and called me out in front of the team whenever he believed I made a mistake. He did the same to my teammates as well, I tried to kindly ask him to stop but he refused. I felt he was abusive.

Managers are put on a pedestal and get tons of power, but also tons of responsibility. They have to deal with tons of external noise and somehow also help guide your team, so most mgrs I see are e.g. working late nights and weekends. This leads to a lower quality of their output IMO.

I got held back from promotions for dumb reasons. One was that there is a waiting line for promotions and even though my manager promised me a promotion, the committee found some other guy who hadn't been promoted in 9 years so they gave him a promotion and made me wait. Right after that my manager promised me it would only be 3 more months, then I heard nothing until 4 months later where he told me the promo would take 1-2 months to apply. So more or less he held a carrot on a stick and misled me for an extra 6 months.

People here look for small petty reasons to write you off. So whenever I gave feedback to my manager he would call me defensive and say I needed to get better at working with others. That was another of his and the promoting committee's reason for holding me back. Not to mention they hadn't even worked with me personally but still said I was hard to work with.

There is a cult of personality-kind of attitude about leaders high up in the company. In my experience these people are pretty fake and really don't care about the product ie Partner Center, they just care about advancing their own career.

Microsoft's HR and ""career"" advice (even from our own managers) is kool-aid, more or less. They really only focus on what Microsoft wants and discourage anything else. This is still better than a lot of companies but IMO bad compared to engineering companies like Stripe (but I think I heard some criticism about them recently? idk).

The Microsoft name is better than most companies, and would be fine for getting into some companies like Amazon, but I think lots of the best tech companies think very little of Microsoft. So it's risky to put it on your resume if you dream of working at strong engineering companies.

2021-06-07, Principal Software Engineer,"Redmond, WA",Current Employee,Proud to work at Microsoft,"I’ve spent my entire 10+ year career at Microsoft and would give the era before Satya leadership a 3/5. The last 5 or so years though have seen many improvements in the bold bets, disruptive technologies, and cultural improvements. The leadership is transparent and accountable.

The best parts of working at Microsoft are the culture of the company (growth mindset), the executive leadership, and the exciting world class products.
","I’m the lower and middle layers, the cross group politics and reward structure can result in competitive internal partnerships. They try to encourage a “one Microsoft” culture but conflicting organization priorities can cause friction.

Satya has really turned the company around for good (bye bye, stack ranking!) and it's the best company I've worked for so far.
","Your usual big company politics, but it's OK and not bad. Sometimes can be lots of internal processes but lots of improvements made lately so as not to impede revenue.

Don't judge a book by its cover and keep giving all your reports a chance. Keep up the great work! You are doing your best and it shows. I appreciate the growth mindset both ways that is truly practised and not just preached.

2021-06-07, Software Engineer,Belgrade,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",2 years in Azure Data team at MDCS Belgrade,"Quality of people is above everything else. People working there are far above average in terms of skill. Everybody who works there for a longer period of time is there because he loves and is seriously invested in some part of software engineering. If you are in it just for the money you wont endure for long. Also, contrary to things I have heard before joining, people are more than willing to help even if they are extremely overwhelmed with work. That is a thing I mush applaud.

Opportunity to work on truly uniquely large projects. I worked in SQL team, developing a new service within Azure Data, and I must say experience is quite something. You get to work with extremely big clients, educational systems of entire countries etc...
","Knowledge. Firstly it is mostly internal. While that is the case with most large companies, it must be mentioned. Secondly, internal documentation is extremely bad, virtually non existing. Usually it boils down to going through 20 years old code, files of 10k lines or more in order to get how things work. It is extremely tiresome. 

Tooling. Amount of time wasted on bugs with tools, simulators, authentication is amazing. And, unfortunately, even though everybody knows about it, it is expected that time you spend on those kinds of problems, isn't included in regular working hours.

There are several top tech companies that I refuse to work for because I have fundamental issues with what they put into the world. MSFT is not one of them.
- Compensation better than many (most?) smaller companies
","- Compensation lower than most other large tech companies
- As with any large company, every team has its own culture and expectations, so it's hit or miss depending on the leadership in your org, from execs who set the overall culture down to your manager who sets your day to day.

2021-05-24, Customer Success Account Manager,"Washington, DC","Current Employee, more than 1 year",DO NOT BECOME A CSAM,"- you work at Microsoft and benefit from the global perks of it being one of the top tech companies.
","- your base pay is minimum 20k lower than any other role at Microsoft (yes, we compared salaries across a pool of 137 new hires, and don't even get started on the difference between this role and engineering)
- you get 3k starting stock as opposed to engineering's 75k (ok, I compared it, plus their base salary is 50k higher by default)
- your career opportunities, network, and benefits pale in comparison to working in engineering
- your role is just as important in generating millions of dollars of revenue as sales people and other members of your teams as your share metrics, so despite you being paid 20k less base (and less commission) you shoulder literally as much responsibility as them.
Advice to Management
Recompensate the role so that it's not a complete mockery of working at Microsoft. We are literally lumped in a core circle of who is critical to the account teams in GSMO (with the Account Tech Strategist and Account Executive) but we make baseline 40k less and almost no commission. This job is not worth it, it sucks the life out of you, and has no career prospects. Why on earth would you put new hires into this role.

","Panders to minority groups by promising progress year over year yet never ultimately delivers.
Stands on accolades of stuffing recruitment channels with Black & Brown employees throughout COVID however did nothing to resolve decade-long known issues of pay inequity, slow promotion velocity, and exclusion from career advancement opportunity.
Launches numerous employee focused programs to address workplace diversity concerns with abysmal success rate, then cherry picks the limited successes for external broadcast.
Significantly below average pay for employees with more than 5+ years tenure.
Repeatedly states promotions are limited while hiring lesser skilled individuals at higher levels (1-2).
Advice to Management
If you have been a manager, leader, or VP of 10+ years go back to the basics and remember core values preached when we were a smaller company.
Stop using public media narratives to initiate equity & diversity programs for corporate gain and flash notoriety. You are filling the hearts and minds of minorities with dreams and visions that will never come true. At least within Microsoft.

","Redmond, WA US centric thinking is still found throughout the company. Some teams are more progressive then others.
Still lets people sink or swim; full of people willing to mentor but very few ""sponsors"" as they often don't want to sick their necks out when they believe in someone. 
Diversity metrics are leaving some talent behind.
Advice to Management
Please watch that diversity metrics don't lead to loss of meritocracy.

Cons
Need to cover on-prem Microsoft products, M365 and Azure, and endlessly be responsive to the customer's urgent break/fix issues, even though there are backend support engineers and product teams, mainly because of language barrier.
Advice to Management
Set CSAM free of break / fix issues. Even though Microsoft introduced a new initiative Incident Management Plus, they just do mechine-management

","The schedule is rotating. It's challenging to go to school and work here (if you attend school in-person)--but it can be done. Running events can be somewhat unorganized.

Pros
Flexibility to get involved with interesting projects and employee resource groups and communities outside of your normal work responsibilities. Culture of empowering others and the best experience with diversity and inclusion I've ever experienced. Customers will always be enterprise level accounts so experience is excellent on most projects.
Cons
I've run into at least one manager not interested in promoting their Consultants unless forced by outside pressure. This experience was verified by discussions with others.

It's easy to find yourself feeling ignored due to the size and amount of work constantly going on. 

Work/life balance with MCS employees is constantly an issue but Microsoft is trying to solve this.
Advice to Management
Find a different metric (impact, for example) to grade Consultants that does not solely rely on utilization. Utilization is frequently not under the control of employees.

Pathethic leadership
Too much office politics

Worst job ever. Please stay away from Microsoft CSEO even if they are paying you high as the high salary is a golden hand cuff for you to tolerate the internal politics. There are senior PMs, Group PMs and delivery managers who are very average technology people and are only passing their time in this organization. You will feel lost in this crowd if you are a high performing and the job will take you 4-5 years back in the career trajectory.

Having talked to multiple people in the organization, it was very evident that it's a known fact that MS IT isn't a good place to land into. Be clear during interviews what you are hiring for and it's high time the organization is revamped.

2021-04-21, Engineering Manager,,Former Employee,Great for Certain Demographics,"Pay and benefits are outstanding. If you are type A and are pushy, your actual competence is less important than your arrogance. After all it's software and computers. So perception of your intelligence is more important than your ability to be humble and simply do a reliable job while slowly learning and becoming a true experts. In hardware, there are no experts at Microsoft, only arrogant fakes.
","If you happen to be a white male, you best not go into management. There have been specific statements including in training of managers that Microsoft is actively seeking to remove white men over 45 to ""get their numbers right"". White men are being removed from management roles in an active fashion, simply for being white. It's revenge time there.

Avoid!,"- Pay and benefits can be initially appealing (however getting a payrise/promotion is near impossible so you're stuck at a certain level for years) 
- talented and smart colleagues 
- work travel used to be fun pre covid 
- work flexibility to choose hours and work remotely
","- Unrealistic/delusional expectations to match competitors in terms of client service with very limited investment in terms of people or product tech. These expectations can lead to bad work life/balance.
- Inadequate management who have a tendency to take credit for the work of the talented people they manage to get ahead. 
- Career progression is tough due to unfair performance review system where popularity is more important than performance 
- Big ambitions but without the budgets to match which leaves the business always playing catch up to competitors 
- Colleagues can be cut throat to protect themselves when things go wrong, team spirit is questionable
Advice to Management
be honest about your failures within your team and address them accordingly whilst admitting your limitations. This fake hot air about being an 'awesome' business all the time grates at so many who have been burnt by the business at some point or another.

- Workforce diversity is visibly higher than in other tech companies I know
- Quality of life in Norway is very high
- Good pay and benefits
- Company supportive during COVID-19 (we got 5 extra days of paid vacation for 2021 to take care of our wellbeing)
- You get a Christmas and Easter gift package sent to your house
- Intelligent and skilled co-workers
- People are nice & polite without being too much into political correctness
- You feel you can speak your mind without fear of repercussions
- Company's focus on privacy is a positive differentiator from some other tech companies (think Facebook or Google)
- The focus is on *customers*, not *users*, which means that there's much less of the ""user as a product / resource to be exploited"" mentality so prevalent in the tech industry
- Very mature product range with world-beating products like Office 365
- Comprehensive relocation support when moving to Norway
","- There is no local HR or payroll, so sorting out any issues takes a lot of time and can be quite stressful esp. when you're relocating
- There is some fighting between the teams over who does the most glamorous bits of data science work
- Systems and documentation are very fragmented, it's hard to find information or to work out how to do things.
- Insufficient investment in computational infrastructure means we have to scale back our ambitions in AI space
Advice to Management
- Sort out HR & payroll in Oslo
- Increase investment in infrastructure to power our ideas and make them work in production
- Integrate systems, processes and codebases more

2021-04-15, Senior Software Engineer,"Redmond, WA","Former Employee, more than 8 years",Probably the best big tech company to work for,"+ Only one of the big tech companies that isn't embroiled in controversy for the kind of harm being done to society, being anti-competitive, having their users be THE product, or being investigated by Congress.
+ Really took care of employees during COVID-19 - for example, Cafe staff were still paid as though they were working full time even though the campus was closed
+ Awesome mission, and probably the most mature culture 
+ Relatively high concentration of talent - you can easily find role models 
+ Work has humongous impact that generally improves productivity, empowers people and organizations, and improve lives.. and because the company does so much open source or uses so much open source, a lot of the work you do has high visibility. I mean imagine being a VS Code engineer...
+ Culture
+ The company takes work life balance and running enduring, sustainable teams very seriously.
","- It is a huge company so there will be some teams that are not as well run, and some teams where there's unfortunately a higher than normal concentration of ""old mindset"" people 
- Microsoft does not pay the best out there. If you're optimizing for direct compensation, this might not be the place for you. Instead, it generally looks at the overall ""deal"".
- It's a great place to ""grow up"" and build a career, but being loyal generally also means that not only are you not super well paid to begin with, the rate that your compensation adjusts naturally also does not keep to pace if you were to jump between companies.
Advice to Management
Ironically, I don't think there is anything special I can give advice on. One of the great things Microsoft does is that it actually cares about employee opinions and has great internal feedback mechanisms... Though it's not *always* super apparent what the company is doing w.r.t. feedback esp. with regards to compensation, on a whole, the company itself actually exhibits a growth mindset :)

Work life balance is good
People are good and you enjoy working and teaming up with folks.
The company places importance to tech events like Hackathon, data scientist meets etc apart from routine work.
","1. A lot depends on manager.
2. Hierarchy is tight and controlled by politics
3. Slow learning and tech stack in most teams is limited to Microsoft tools and techs
4. Salary difference could be high if you start with low base pay. Experienced folks are getting quite low as compared to new hires. A big salary difference as compared to your peers is discouraging

2021-04-10, User Experience Product Manager,"Redmond, WA","Current Employee, more than 5 years",Great place to work,"Microsoft can be an awesome place to work if you are in the right organization. The benefits are really top notch, the pay is good, there are a ton of opportunities so if you don’t like your current role you can often find another that is interesting. They’re really taking strides and trying to show up when it comes to D+I efforts - they have A LOT of work to do but it’s nice they are trying.
","Since it’s such a great place to work, you can often find people who are just coasting until retirement. There’s a lot of complacent people, especially in the more senior positions. Also, on some teams (not all!) there can be a very competitive, corporate vibe. Sometimes this results in less team work and more people chasing the spotlight.

Due to internal policies and processes surrounding the Business Support Discipline it has ostracized members of the group.

Often times feels that in order to change business disciplines or career paths, one must leave the company to do so, even if they are qualified for the position that they are seeking.

","Average Engineers, Scientists and PMs with not related degrees in the task or title they are assigned to.. it is pretty political to get promotions and get visibility ..

Highly PM oriented (you expect MSFT to be Engineer oriented.. well, you are wrong :) ) ...Low compensation, bonus, RSU and career development.. People leave after 3 to 4 years on an average.. only a limited ones would stay (they are usually the ones who can not get a better offer somewhere else (low competency in their title; but highly politically correct to play the game there right).. Good luck receiving promotion (you get stuck at the senior level 63/4 there).
Advice to Management
Take career development seriously (D&I should be practiced in action and not just talked about) or you would lose your top talents (Engineers/Scientists).. Make the company to work bottom to top, instead of old school way of top to bottom, where PM or the authorities would mainly dictate the priorities .. Your competitors (Google/FB etc.) have become bottom to top and highly Engineering oriented almost a decade ago (you are almost losing the battle in top talent acquisition and keeping them there at the senior level)... You dont need so many PMs with an MBA... what you need is great coders/engineers/scientists to growth the business..

","Middle management are disconnected from the company culture and reality. Empathy and customer obsession are not their fist priority, their bonus and gaining more power is.
Advice to Management
Focus on team and customer impact vs rewards on individual short term metrics. Move to a model where HR is not there to shield managers from employee but actually to help employees if needed. When sensitive issues are raised, HR is not your friend but enemy. When middle management have too much culture can get toxic.

","No policy for encouraging seniors to stay. Once you sign the contract, you remain with that salary regardless of inflation. So you get a situation where seniors are paid 7K and newcomers are paid 11K . Outrageous. Furthermore, there is a lack of transparency in leveling process. For example during a meeting designed to clarify such things a director was providing answers to some of the questions , but when asked directly what approvals are needed for an employee to advance to a certain level he dodged the question and then ghosted . The reason most likely is because he can't admit that there isn't an approval required for those levels

I'm a huge fan of diversity and Satya speaks to reason for needing a diverse workforce quite eloquently, but something is getting lost in translation because most of the white men I interact with have said they have no future at MSFT. Many are already looking at other opportunities that will give them mobility within their career. Disenfranchisement of an entire demographic is the opposite of diversity and inclusion.

","I never thought laptops would be an issue but I went through 3 laptops in less than a year.

I had worked in corporate America for almost 20 years at that point and neverhad the computer problems I had in that role, let alone persistent problems. It was awful.
Advice to Management
Direct manager was weak when it came to interdepartment trouble resolution. Alot of changes were underway that shifted administrative work from Operations to Sales/Implementation teams. Their employees didn't want to take on those responsibilities and pushed back consistently. Anytime they escalated he never held them accountable for their department's responsibility in attending appropriate training and implementing new work responsibilities within their own teams. I had never seen that level of rolling over on something that was so critical to the changes Operations was moving away from. I lost alot of respect for him in the process.

","Pros aside, the team I ended up with was extremely subpar. It is very apparent that management does not value gaming and offered little to no support since it was not a priority within the store. It was an extremely stressful job since you are expected to work retail and also cover the admin end of the position on top of that. What could have been a super awesome opportunity within gaming turned out to be one of the most stressful experiences in terms of work.
Advice to Management
LISTEN TO YOUR EMPLOYEES and acknowledge the work they put into the store. It rarely felt as though I was doing a good job and I constantly felt like my work was never good enough for my management. Favoritism in the workplace should have been avoided.

Let your engineers concentrate on working cases, not whatever silly idea you come up with to make your mark as a new Sr manager.

When that idea is bad and we reject it...listen and accept it and move on to your next stupid idea. Sr. Leadership is completely out of touch and engineers suffer for it.

- Massive networking capacity, nearly everyone is willing to meet you

- Company culture is on a positive trajectory and upheld by a majority of leaders

Be mindful of how little attention is paid to anyone who is not in a product group. It's nearly impossible to switch roles, and the organizations often offer little prospects for future career.

2021-03-01, SERVICE ADVISOR,,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Was good in Stores, now they don't care.","When they operated in Stores, it felt good, we had plenty of unique opportunity in our roles and capabilities, and could explore other areas of interest if we wanted. We were given guidelines but allowed to operate creatively and change things up to better fit our needs and our customer's needs. We could strive and grow in our areas, and participate in other areas as we wanted to and could while still helping our customers.
","Over the last year, they've forced thousands of retail employees to change careers, some not by much and many by a LOT (i.e from Gaming Experts and Service Advisors into Glorified Telemarketer Business Sales). Senior leadership is completely tone deaf, they no longer care about their public perception, their employees, or whether we're happy or not and tell us ""you should be grateful you still have a job"" and ""if you don't like it, you can leave"" and that somehow we're just as privileged as a VP making 6 figures. There's so little focus on career growth outside of sales, it's incredible, but they keep touting ""oh well you can continue to develop in this space and search for those opportunities"". The culture of ""greater Microsoft"" which is what they call corporate, is incredibly downward looking at anybody in the other parts of the organization. Over half of the retail employees have left for one reason or another, primarily from their careers being obliterated and shoved to the side and our management and leadership not even bothering to try and pretend like they care anymore, and I don't blame them whatsoever.
Advice to Management
Clean out your upper management and Senior Leadership Team, get people in there that actually care about the employees, care about the company, and aren't incredibly tone deaf and privileged. Make opportunities for people outside of Sales, because shockingly, not everyone wants to be in sales or be glorified telemarketing.

There is no concept of time-off or vacation and people expect you to work even during vacation. This leads to frequent burnouts
Advice to Management
Please encourage people to take time-off without any work related disturbance. This is important for their overall health and performance and directly impacts company performance as well

I am sure some of the people watching this review will be happy cuz there are lot of thankless liars and political folks dying to earn money and respect even if it comes by deceit. Overall pretty pathetic culture and only good for such politics ridden people. The company still works well only because of few good engineers, the legacy of good old products, copy of new software services like azure as a pure copy of AWS etc and ok ceo who is good at acquisitions, monetization, and politics. Also, managers are ready to invest in extra below average engineers who likes to play their slave than good solid engineers and actually they can survive by creating new issues and redoing same stuff. Who knows what is going on in the code except good engineers, they justify wrong and incorrect things. The services actually suffer a lot of issues and life of engineers becomes hell fixing and monitoring them.

Overall if you are a good human being who likes to contribute and play fair, this company is hell. It's full of liars, cheaters, dirty politics, unfair practices in review and work management. But if you can play politics along with these cheaters, you may not get to do great work and responsibilities but can survive and grow. In sort, Awesome for low quality engineers who like to play poor politics and culture.
Advice to Management
Fire most of immediate and senior managers and revoke powers of promotion etc from managers and give weightage to contribution more than a bunch of liars say under influence of pre-consensus or for self-benefits. All the managers do things only for their benefits. Responsibilities and true performance is far smaller compared to political benefits. There must be self-awareness check before promoting to higher positions. When animalistic mindset reach at powerful positions, they only misuse and mistreat the system and being unaware, they don't even realize and keep putting the blame at others, many a times deliberately.

","Employees don't share in the success of the company. They use equity awards to link your compensation to the company success. But - the problem ids, those awards are given out based on subjective personal performance criteria, measured against other employees in an organization. It is particularly bad for the CSAs and GBB where the bulk of your variable comp is this thing called ""CBI"", which has nothing to do with the success of the company. It has everything to do with ""managing your brand"" and networking up. So - even if Azure is killing it - 150% of plan, if you don't ""measure up"" with your ""Impact"", you may still not even get your OTE. Some people might like this, it does have one plus, you have total control over it, or at least your own performance relative to what are subjective and unknowable criteria. If you like being a thoroughbred racehorse in the stable and running flat out races against the other horses in the stable, GBB/CSA might be for you. If you like being a contributing member of a high preforming team, probably not.
Advice to Management
Change the comp plans from the CBI ""Hunger Games Lottery"" to a more traditional revenue based compensation plan.

2021-02-22, Customer Success Manager,"New York, NY","Current Employee, more than 5 years","Slow movement, massive rewards","Pay and compensation regularly above market. Remote work has been always available, and a giant organization gives employees the opportunity to explore all kinds of interests and resources. Culture of inclusion pivoting to hire from ""non-traditional"" backgrounds is beginning to build an interesting and diverse workforce. Strong Senior Leadership. Great benefits, tuition reimbursement especially. Skilling focus, self-managed growth and learning opportunities, and the name recognition that can be quite impressive to external hiring.
","Benefits standard for tech, but on the lower rungs (retail, employees sub. <60,000) the co-pays can be impactful. Difficult to time tuition reimbursements to ""real"" college semesters, best to apply yearly instead.

Management in direct teams are under so much pressure to perform that they can in turn overwhelm or give conflicting information on a day-to-day basis. Low retail-to-corporate transition pipeline exacerbated by shuttering of retail stores in favor of hub model. Poor communication when internal hires are concerned. 

Rarely hear back from hiring managers or recruitment agents unless you are being hired. No feedback on interviews that do not result in a hire. Promises for temporary roles to become permanent that never materialize and return now over-skilled employees to lower rungs, making even moving forward in another organization difficult.

Quarterly team rotations leave customers with few resources that they know directly, and employees are often placed on a merry-go-round of ""find new person in charge.""
Advice to Management
Accelerate Retail to Corporate pipeline instead of utilizing Hubs as stopgaps for culling former physical retail employees. Hard schedule ""development hours"" and integrate them into manager responsibility, so skilling can occur during the workday. Greater feedback during hiring/promotion/interview process is necessary.

","CO+I is a toxic environment. Management allows VPs and GMs to treat each other unprofessionally. Meetings devolve into passive aggressive or outright aggressive scenarios where everything is blame-oriented. Managers micromanage due to fear of getting called out by senior management. Politics are worse than any other company I've been at and, despite all the ""diversity"" focus, women are treated worse than men once they get there, and women are hired in above their experience level which leads to even more ""she was only hired because she is a woman"" mentality
Advice to Management
Expect your senior management to treat everyone with respect, and get rid of the blame-oriented culture that encourages mistake avoidance rather than innovation and teamwork.

2021-02-09, Software Engineer,"Redmond, WA","Former Employee, more than 1 year",Good company with growing pains,"I feel that Microsoft is really trying to improve the world and life for the people in the places where Microsoft does business. They really care about the wellbeing and work-life balance of their employees.
","During times of rapid growth in a department, work-life balance is often pushed aside while more and more responsibilities are pushed onto the engineers. No new resources are added to help deal with these responsibilities leading to team burnout. Microsoft does encourage taking time off when you need it, but often the increasing demands and emergency situations that arise during times of rapid team growth overwhelm the time we could take off during such times.
Advice to Management
When there are periods of large growth, please try to limit how many new features are promised. One of the causes of burnout in our team was the incredible number of new features we were asked for without any time to test or validate the features. This would then cause them to break and we would need to fix them while already trying to get the next new feature ready in record time.

Quality PMs are essential in making a project progress and keeping engineers separated from bureaucracy if desired, but these people seem hard to find. Also, company keeps recording record profits and revenue yet this does not seem to be reflected in salary growth for rank and file employees, which is disappointing yet unsurprising these days.

Advice to Management
Constantly defunding projects to throw more headcount at whatever's on fire is demoralizing. It's expected to happen when necessary, but when every project you start gets derailed it's really hard to keep the feature crews motivated and engaged.

2021-01-19, Software Engineer II,"Redmond, WA","Current Employee, more than 5 years",Great all around job but underpays relative to competitors,"Management recognizes hard work and/or talent. Good culture, employees are majority upbeat. Workspace is modern and beautiful. Work-life balance is encouraged.
","For being a top 4 tech company, pay is significantly lower than 4 closest competitors. Team dependant.. but management has a tendency to ignore large technical problems.. or under estimate complexity of projects leading to false starts and resets where we have to dig out of the hole we find ourselves in. Commonly, a virtual team prototypes with no domain knowledge, ships it, gets rewards, and hands off maintenance to the experts to fix. Maintaining team is expected to pull miracle fixes out but isn't rewarded proportional to the challenge. Horizontal hops are disproportionately rewarded vs. consistent top contributors.
Advice to Management
Be careful to avoid incentive structures that incentivize taking shortcuts to ship quickly. My observation has been we end up paying the cost in triplicate later down the line. This debt compounds into missed opportunities, poor user experience, and loss of talent. Consider offering other work locations. The coasts are terribly expensive and offer much lower quality of life that many talented ICs want, despite the extra pay.

* Certain teams and organization are prone to long periods of crunch time. You might have to move around internally to get the preferred work life balance.

Advice to Management
Make sure to increase pay for those who stick with the company for years. Many people leave after 3-5 years since other companies will offer more for the same job.

2021-01-13, Software Engineer II,"Bellevue, WA","Current Employee, more than 3 years",Microsoft is a great company to work for,"Great benefits, great pay compared to a smaller company, very flexible schedule, the ability to take your job anywhere, smart people, impact on products used by people all over the world, very diverse, there's lots of good things!

Most of all, it's a company that truly does have integrity.
","It's a big company so don't expect to get to do it all like you would at a startup. Things move slower, you have to spend a lot more time in meetings and coordinating with people, there's lots of paperwork to do for most tasks.
Advice to Management
Management kind of depends, some software engineering managers are good some not so good. Anyone who's converted from an SE to a manager usually doesn't have a lot of skills transference. It's very easy to move around in the company though so if you're not happy with your current manager it's easy to find another team. Upper management is very good though. They care about employees, our impact on the world, and I have never met anyone at Microsoft ever even considering doing something unethical.

2021-01-13, Cloud Solution Architect,,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","Great place to work, choice of team is important though","- You really get the sense that the senior management cares about the well being of its staff
- Diversity and Inclusion are taken very seriously here
- Work life balance is excellent
- Lots of encouragement to stretch yourself and try new things. A great place to learn new technology and take on a new career direction.
- Internal mobility is good. A lot of people move around including internationally.
","- it can get very political, especially in the orbit of ""corp"" ie Redmond
- still some old school managers that haven't embraced the new Satya era ethos and treat their team badly. Bad managers can really affect your enjoyment of this role
- role priorities and structures change frequently, which can be confusing at times
Advice to Management
In general things are very good. 
Beware of adding so much process and admin overhead that people start to feel like faceless resources. It's beginning to move in that direction.

I am extremely grateful that I was working for Microsoft when the pandemic hit.
","In Support we are viewed as a cost center and as such, we are squeezed for efficiency and have to fight for any additional resources or headcount that we may need. Leadership is receptive but change is slow.

Workload can be overwhelming at times and processes paint a different expectation than reality.

Ability to relocate and travel globally

Good pay and benefits

Get to work with smart people
","Toxic politics and limited critical thinking, points of view are focused on whats popular rather than hard conversations.

Managers are trained how to control employee feedback and outcomes

Too many policies and procedures, most legalistic company ive ever worked for

Projects or new initiatives are cut short if no traction is seen in one quarter, afraid to try new things, management sticks with whats popular, low hanging fruit and easy with an extremely short term focused view so that a perceived legacy is seen
Advice to Management
be honest and open and transparent, even if its not popular. Stick with new initiatives and learn from mistakes and stop repeating the same bad ideas. Don't be afraid to say other tech companies do it better and learn from that, rather than always assuming Microsoft has to be different.

Pros
Great work life balance with leadership who truly care about their people as individuals. Leaders lead with empathy. Lot of upward mobility and opportunities for advancement. Management takes the time to understand your individual strengths and what value you can add and then let’s you really come into your own and have an impact in those areas. 

Healthcare benefits are amazing, no premiums and MSFT gives 2k for HSA (for a couple). Employee stock purchase plan at 10% discount offered quarterly. Bonuses based on performance. 15 days PTO + 2 personal holidays + 10 days sick time.
Cons
I don’t find any cons to working for Microsoft.

2021-01-08, Software Engineer II,"London, England, England","Former Employee, more than 5 years",Great place to work but slow pace,"Microsoft is a great place to work and learn large scale production applications. The people are very nice and easy to get along with. Plenty of perks and activities to take up and get involved with the community. The company will take of you and provide all it can to keep you happy. The longer you stay the more money you will make.
","The pace is slow, very slow depending on the team. You could be left twiddling your thumbs and very uninteresting work. Many people switch teams regularly to avoid stagnation. Challenging and fun work only seems to fall to a small number of ""superstar"" teams, if you are not one of them youll stagnate.
Advice to Management
Try to make work interesting for employees and challenging. Recognition is good but the promotion cycle is terribly slow, many people leave just to get promotions.

Pros
Same perks as SDE and Microsoft Engineering Teams
Big Campus
Smart People to work with
Cons
Pay scale is pathetic, after working for 5 years I am at level 58. However a fresher from IIT joins at level 58. 
Microsoft services charges a lot from customers so to cut cost they cut short on resources hence I have to do extra work and put more efforts.
Utilization is key for getting hike. You have to maintain 80+ util else no hike for you, even if you not getting projects, its your problem to get projects.
Hike is very low even you make hit your util
Transitioning to different roles (lateral moves) means you get more work and responsibility but no pay hike
Moving to ""Engineering"" team is impossible
In the end its all about business
Advice to Management
Please make it easy for internal switches and tell all the hidden HR policies upfront.
Also please make pay scale up to industry levels.

2021-01-07, Software Engineer II,Oslo,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",The Dream Company,"When I came to work for Microsoft over 3 years ago, I thought it was my dream company, and 3 years later the company lives up to my expectations entirely! The biggest pros of working here from my perspective are:
1. Extremely professional yet relaxed environment
2. Huge impact of job you do (user base of 1 million is an ""emerging product"", we think in 10s and 100s of millions)
3. Good and consistent work-life balance (especially in Norway: time with family is YOUR time, and it is protected very well...)
4. Great handling of WFH during covid
5. People rarely leave and only do so with a very good reason and normally after staying in company for many years, so it is safe to make friends (if you've been to startups, you might know what I mean! :D)
","1. Career growth may be perceived as slow (it does not get any faster than 1 promotion per year, and for most it is 1 promotion per 1.5 years)
2. Salaries are not insanely high (we're slightly above market in Oslo, but the job we do is waaay above market in Oslo...)
3. Things may be perceived as generally slow (well, we're over 150k people at the moment of writing, after all...)

Still, none of these cons could make me drop a star. I have been having a great time since day 1 and will likely keep doing so for maaany years to come :)
Advice to Management
Please consider reindexing salaries for everyone in Norway ~5% up... :)

Great work-life balance
If you are on the right team & role you can have lots of fun while doing hard work
Products and services are fantastic
","Politics. Once you become director your growth path changes entirely. It becomes a mission to find a sponsor, ""serve the coffee"" and not caring much about the results in the field. The only thing it matters is to keep your boss/skip/sponsor happy and make them look good, regardless of what the REAL result on the ground is.
It's all about making the stock price steady and growing. Any slow down creates automatic panic and an incredible amount of churn across so many people that is painful just to watch an army of folks to move for a powerpoint creation. 
Since the stock price is what matters, everything is short-term oriented. While google, amazon, salesforce and others are making long-term bets from a sales perspective, MSFT just wants to close the quarter in good shape.

3. Company is known for its culture. People do respect and help each other.

Too many deadweight middle managers;
MS struggles with promoting within the organization. I was promoted a few times but saw many outstanding employees become afterthoughts when it came to advancement;
Hiring practices quite often based on race and gender. Management was very concerned about having the proper ""ratio"" of employees who were either white, black, hispanic, female, male, etc.;

2020-12-18,,New Delhi,"Former Employee, less than 1 year",Provided a seamless internship experience even during COVID19 times,"Okay.

..... okay.

I am going to explain, right now, why a work from home internship I did at Microsoft India during Corona-Quarantine times has been one of the single best and most important experiences of my life as an aspiring SDE.

This isn’t the first time I have tried. There are a half-dozen half-finished Word documents on my laptop, all of them abandoned at some point because I felt like I was failing to express myself. I mean, there’s a lot at stake here. My devotion to the company and what it represents has been such that, despite being a huge linux advocate for most of my coding life, I found myself shifting to everything Microsoft, from browser to IDE to Dev environment, in the last 8 weeks. I have witnessed (in a very virtual first hand fashion) MS software design philosophy, have interacted with its global workforce and experienced its culture. I have seen the massive organisational wheel in action, and witnessed how every single employee plays a part in the system, a system where despite being an intern, you can make a tangible impact with just a laptop and some passion.

But enough is enough. The more I procrastinate about writing this, the hazier my memory will be and the less I’ll do the experience justice. So here I go. This article will be in three parts. Which is a bit pretentious, but it can’t be helped, for it’s the only way to show you what this experience showed me.

You ready? I’m not ready. Okay let’s do this.
","Nothing much, honestly. The work culture at MSFT is brilliant.

+ The corporation cares about their employees, providing wonderful resources and benefits during COVID 
+ Ability to start a new career within the same company is entirely possible
","- Work life balance is very challenging depending on the business you're in. The faster the business is growing the less life you have. 
- You're not always compensated for great results and hard work. A huge part of your promotion and rewards is dependent on your manager who often have favorites. You can be demonstrating high performance many levels about your level, exceeding target results, and work 50 hrs a week but not get a promotion because you don't have ""a big enough work scope"" 
- The red tape and patchwork in some areas often adds 3-6 weeks to an item that should take a couple of days.

2020-12-09, Program Manager,"München, Bavaria, Bavaria","Former Employee, more than 10 years",Fair deal - but mainly for FTEs,"Lot's of opportunities ahead - strong market maker. Cloud business and AI opps while business applications are the money maker still.
","As with all enterprise companies there is a lot of competition within organizational parts no matter what size - many people feel the need to proof themselves and there is more talking than actual listening and working on issues.
Advice to Management
Upper management gives a lot of very good guidance. The following through by mid-level and lower-level managers is not as good. While FTEs (full time employees) get a good package all-up, from what I saw there is the downside that NON-FTEs are not treated in the same way. Often there are promises to do what's possible to switch them into FTEs positions, but only maybe 5 - 10% of those promises are kept. Lower and Mid-level managers often use the excuse that they have no impact in these decisions - and very often at the latest time possible.

Advice to Management
The first management level need to do a better job in supporting their team as they look at new opportunities within the business, very often they are only focussing on themselves - this changes when you get to more senior management who are comfortable in their seniority and are supportive. In addition it is this level of management who really don't live by the culture and values.

Repor","The first management level need to do a better job in supporting their team as they look at new opportunities within the business, very often they are only focussing on themselves - this changes when you get to more senior management who are comfortable in their seniority and are supportive. In addition it is this level of management who really don't live by the culture and values.

Advice to Management
Instead of just talking about embracing open source, actually do it.
Stop moving so slow and give teams real autonomy.
Embrace modern development practices.
Actually create good products for your customers instead of the low-quality, buggy, ducktape-patched stuff we regularly pushed out the door.

I left after less than a year to a very innovative, customer centric, exciting team at Amazon, all while getting a 50% increase to my compensation. One of the best decisions I ever made.

2020-11-19, Principal Software Engineer,"Redmond, WA","Former Employee, more than 10 years",A 12+ year Software Developers' thoughts,"Microsoft Brand. Even a remote villager on the other side of the world will know & respect you.

Good values they stand for. You will see some active ongoing work on BLM issue; you will see candid care & timely response for COVID etc. 

There are still some good engineers & managers left at Microsoft. 

Good Benefits.

No/very less bureaucracy - Directors/Partners will often chat with you and help you resolve technical stuff. Most of the Senior Management is technically Sound.
","Very poor rewards compared to similar roles in the industry. for ex: for Principal role competitors pay over 80%.

Many teams in Azure are stuck in REPETITIVE work like migrating from PAAS V1 infrastructure to the PAAS V2 infra, rotating Certificates etc. Very unproductive. Several quarters - teams would not deliver an ounce of actual Service features - but, just the technical debt. Leadership, higher up - lacked vision & failed to align this well back in 2012 - azure inception times and existing new developers are taking a hit because of that.

Poor tech Vision, atleast in Azure. 

Satya Nadella, the great visionary and exceptional leader - tells a lot of cool stuff - but the middle management doesn't seem to give a damn. Most of them have no idea what he is telling. They don't get time to follow him :). For ex: no/very few managers follows growth mindset or Leadership principles or hiring-in as an interviewing philosophy. They are good people. Just that, they are so worked up - that there won't be any time left to listen to these.

Most of the Teams across the company are moving to Services model. You will end up working 24/7; no family nights; no weekends - if you know stuff :).

Rewards and Compensation model - almost incentivizes people to not share information and work in isolation. This has a huge negative impact on the Culture. Culture in many teams is close to Toxic. 

Large delay between MS Polls. Or in general - data about how things are going or employee experience - is collected like - once in an Year! By the time the data is collected - most of the times - the problems faced become irrelevant.

Movement inside the company is not easy. Especially, Principal engineers have extra diversity based rules - which reduces the available options from an already reduced set.
Advice to Management
More education/alignment to Middle Management on Satya's vision/goodness.

Fair rewards policy to Senior/entry-Principal band. This layer is generally very dissatisfied and has very high attrition rate and very hard to replace. Even worse, they have followers.

Azure LT should consider Funding based on Proactive Vision - instead of being Reactive to Market. Things like ManagedIdentity, KeyVault, Unified RBAC across all azure services etc just came unacceptably late in the game for Azure - which are few examples of how funding based on Tech vision would have helped.

","Product engineers/devs are put on regular 24/7 support rotations. Teams are subject to relatively frequent reorgs and changes in direction. A bad manager or management chain can stall your career pretty quickly.
Advice to Management
Way too scorecard/dashboard driven - many teams are held only to scorecards and work only towards scorecard status, regardless of the secondary negative impacts on products, support, employees, and customers. 

There are too many things that are easily gameable on a scorecard (bug/release metrics), and too many things that can't be accurately quantified (impacts of bad design causing issues later). The threat of red scorecards and dashboards hangs over many decisions on the front lines.

Advice to Management
A little less volatility when it comes to directives and priorities as a whole would actually make employees feel that the work they are doing is important, meaningful, and valuable.

There's nothing quite like pouring your blood, sweat, and tears into a project or a group stated goal to then have it suddenly changed with no clear justification or plan to come back and address the project that was put on pause. There was a lot of hype and buzz about the first thing we were working on and once getting by-in to arbitrarily change it without a good rational rather makes the first priority seem not so important and also calls into question if management really means what they say.

This constant culture of ""escalation"" creeps into everyone's work and it makes you start to question your teammates and coworkers as to the validity of that priority because every individual's work seems to be a top priority and that just can't be the case.

","Ask for family photos and randomly ping your manager to get attention, retirement-oriented attention seeker manager will add you to the list of reliable, diligent engineer.
Keep appreciating management for random reasons. 
Anonymous feedbacks are a big lie. Management has deep roots in the system to identify, who provided which feedback.
Do not implement anything just keep on throwing ideas, teams feeding on ideas from a decade and getting promoted without any real work.
Management has identified the pattern of reorg so no one would actually ask for real work.
PPT based culture for reflecting impact. Passive manager gets them created by engineers and present it to the management

2020-11-05, Data Center Technician,"Dublin, Dublin","Former Employee, more than 5 years",One of the Worst Places I've Worked.,"There's no real pros working in this Microsoft Data Centre in Grangecastle Dublin they will destroy you and not give a damn.
","I worked on Shift in the Data Centre, in Grangecastle Dublin and it's got one of the most Toxic working environments I ever witnessed. Management have no interest in helping you progress, the only way you can progress is to rat on your colleagues back to management, boot lick, hard work is not recognised only numbers and if the metrics don't add up you're not doing your job, work quality suffers as a result then they get on your back, the constantly change the goal posts and don't pay you extra for working bank holidays.

They can't leave you to do your job you are highly harassed and micro managed to the point of breaking. 

Even your own colleagues will be looking through the ticket system to see what other colleagues are doing, interfering with their work and hanging them to management if they feel they thought they were doing something wrong, this is the culture they nurture in Microsoft. 

Nepotism is rampant and this has created a gigantic click which see people get promotions who don't deserve it. People who haven't a clue, just in the door next you know they're giving you orders.

You are forced to watch training videos on how to think and behave and to accept their way and political views. 

One Brainwashing video I watched wants you to be paranoid about your colleagues, if they come to work in a new car and you feel their salary doesn't reflect that they should have a new car you're to report it, if they say they're depressed, you're to report it, if they say anything against management you should report it etc, you would have to see this material to believe it. 

They're big into Diversity making you feel if you're white and a Native and male you're not important.

On site security is a complete joke, airport like check points all over the place, empty pockets, take off your belt, take off your shoes, security are even minions carrying out orders from management and they're not even Microsoft staff. This creates an illusion that data bearing devices can't be taken out of server rooms and just adds to the stress because they don't need to be there causing extra stress.

Access to parts for techs is a complete joke, this site is massive and you might have to walk 2 Km for simple things like hard drives in the p1ssing rain at 3am because the site is made up of many separate buildings and you have to drive around or walk around it's a lot of hassle, getting in and out through security with parts through security portals, basically the whole job is endless hassle, if they can make the job more inconvenient they will. They won't stock each building with the needed parts only some basic parts, you spend so much time walking around a massive site which adds to the burn out meanwhile the clock is ticking and you got to do so many tickets which half your shift goes looking for parts or walking. No shelter between buildings in Irish Weather ? absolute joke. 

They have what they call a monthly Goal which involves paying employees to find fault in other employees such as not wearing of high vis vest, maybe someone was seen driving a little faster on site than they should, so you have your own colleagues walking around waiting and hiding around corners to see if you do something, once a month then when management review the monthly Goal one Employee is awarded 100 Euro's for ratting out another colleague, basically they want normal non management staff doing the job for managers. 

My advice is never to waste your time applying for Microsoft Data Centre in Grangecastle Dublin. It's toxic and they'll burn you out and toss you out like dirt, the novelty of working for Microsoft wears out very quickly.

Diversity is Fostered and encouraged 
Colleagues are World Class
","Performance review is 100% based on one person and if that person suffers from bias and racism, nothing can be done from the company to stop them from sabotaging your career.

That person can set moving targets to justify you not being sufficient and subsequently getting fired.

HR will not help other than to try and mediate the situation the help you feel better.

Workplace investigation won't help they are only there to minimize the legal risk to thr company.

If you work here and get a crappy manager, my advice would be to shut up and take it until you can transfer to another manager. No matter how much notice you make about the situation, your manager will always win and it's unfair and it sucks.

Be aware that there are managers that don't believe in the Microsoft culture of inclusiveness, puts unnecessary pressure/negativity towards employees, but able to appear ""nice and genuine"" whenever meeting with upper management. Difficult to report to HR, since this type of manager makes friends with everyone they can, to pull favors.

2020-10-23, Software Engineer,,Former Employee,great place to grow (old),"Great benefits, compensation, work-life balance (one of the best in big tech), range of opportunities. Good leadership, career progression, and clear HR processes.
","Microsoft's a fantastic place to work if you're raising a family or have been in the industry for a while, and it definitely shows. When HQ is in the suburbs and the workforce is older compared to the rest of big tech, the culture is less ""Silicon Valley"" and more ""comfy employer to work for the rest of your life"".

As much as Microsoft tries to position itself as working on ""sexy"" technology, the core business is B2B business systems, and unless you happen to be working on select teams like Xbox/Hololens/Azure, you'll most likely be working on technology that's been around for a long time and processes that are resistant to change. These systems are profitable & successful, without a doubt, but they're hard to get excited about on a daily basis.

Further streamline. WW and GSMO fissure with two alpha leaders is not useful. Consolidate under one banner leader. Too much focus on diversity and inclusion is causing hiring of untalented folks. Do not compromise talent at the expense of inclusion. It thwarts progression and innovation. Tim to cull the stale and stagnant leaders who are not good middle managers or program owners.

Meanwhile people I knew at MS in the position I am now saw at least a 60% increase in salary spread out accross those 5 years. At least this is a company that understands the value in keeping experienced engineers.
Also, if you really want a technical deep dive into any MS tech, this is the place to get hired at in RO.
MS has a focus on making connections, so you will end up learning from some very experienced people (I am refering to a Escalation role, you only get the toughest technical issues here).
","I feel MS is much more disorganized in terms of ramp-up, available knowledge base and, it must be said, there’s a general sence of inexperience when it comes to handling queue volumes. Might be the fact that finding truly qualified people for the job and finding them in sufficient numbers is hard, but I don’t think that’s the only reason.

2020-10-16, Assistant General Counsel,"Redmond, WA",Current Employee,Interesting work but too much bureaucracy and politics in legal department.,"Interesting work, novel issues, working at the intersection of law, business, and tech.
","Management doesn't always trust or empower their employees. Experience, inside and/or outside, is downplayed or ignored by ""lifer"" managers. What some of these lifers have contributed or continue to contribute to justify their roles is not clear. Politics clearly play a role in promotions and role assignment - they follow the form of the process over embracing the substance of the process.
Advice to Management
You have a number of experts in your organization. Listen to them. Good ideas are not limited to CELA's SLT or LT. Politics are burying some great employees - several have left and several more are in the process.

2020-10-16, Senior GPM,"Redmond, WA",Current Employee,Highly political but rewarding experience,"- At the forefront of technology
- A strong brand with positive global recognition
- Smart people everywhere
- Lots of opportunities to moves within the company and get a variety of exposure
- Great campus, lots of activities and restaurants in cafes
- Wonderful connector buses to take you from meeting to meeting
- Projects are interesting, work is rewarding when we ship 
- We build on our own cloud services, which is really a nice differentiator 
- Redmond area is beautiful, and there are paths around campus that go through woody areas for a run during lunch break
- Benefits are fantastic
","- it takes at least a year to ""get Microsoft"". If you're a senior member joining from the outside, don't expect to make waves your first few months. Microsoft is very relationship based, and to build relationships takes time.
- Politics. It's everywhere and you can't avoid it. There's a lot of people waiting for their moment to shine, and will take credit any opportunity that they can for others work, just to justify their involvement.
- Too many meetings. It's actually a bit out of control. For every executive meeting, expect at least 4 prep meetings to get to that meeting.
- Diversity is also a con. Most senior tech leaders are men. The way of doing work is very aggressive, so the women that do make it that far are usually not very likeable.
- Re-orgs are constantly happening. In one year I had 6 managers. I get it, we have to change org structures constantly to keep up with market demands. But 6? really?
- Since the pandemic, I'm working constantly 12 hours a day. It's not sustainable.
Advice to Management
The commitment to diversity is good via lip service, but the general population is 50% female. Why are we so bad at helping women succeed? You won't publish the statistics of how many women are in tech roles, because it is bad. We see it, and that just adds insult to injury. Think of how that reflects back to your female leaders. We feel like there's a wall in technical career progression, and that honestly is holding people back from wanting to stay in a company that doesn't value our contribution.

- Customer facing role
","- Heavily opting the BROs culture!
- No Career path/Coaching for Non-FTEs staff
- Salary increase/bonus are all back to leader guesstimate factor, no fair clear and achievable KPIs
- Some leaders set unclear challenges full of buzz words
- Technical learning curve becomes flat so quickly in a year or max 2 depends on your prior experience
- Non-FTEs are not treated or having responsibilities nor having career progression likewise full time employees
- Conversion from a Non-FTE to full time employee is based on manager's subjective favor, no fair opportunities are given to all.
- No HR, no rules protecting your rights and benefits when you leave, and labor law allows company shifted type of contract against the Non-FTEs.
Advice to Management
- High turnover for non-FTEs, if you want to avoid business impact and retain talents, at least when its possible, provide fair opportunities to all when it comes to career and salary progression.

2. Good people and some great engineers.
2. Mostly OK work environment if you can live with some of cons, mentioned below.
","Actually, quite a many. 

1. No innovation at work place! Risk takers are not rewarded and in some cases, may get punished. This results into mostly, me-too, albeit inferior products.
2. Managers are engaged in protecting their turfs. They feel defensive or even threatened by better/creative ideas. 
4. Most of time, product features /roadmap are simply copy of primary competitor in the respective domain. This is easy and you can see it even if you are an outsider. 
3. Top-down, hierarchical management style. You need to kowtow to your boss to get good performance review and bonus and stock reward. 
5. There are number of bullies in higher-ups technical/management leadership with huge egos. You could hardly find any original papers authored these tech leaders, which is quite common in companies such as Google, Facebook etc. These tech leader derive power from their position!
Advice to Management
1. Practice what you preach outside and inside the company
2. Throw out bullies. Bring in some outsiders in your rank.
3. Bring-on culture of innovation. Stop copying your competitors!

Pros
Microsoft has good work ambience and smart folks. The company allows good balance of professional and personal aspirations. Being bigger organization, it has really wide spectrum of project, teams, groups.
Cons
It's difficult to get end to end project life cycle experience e.g. hardly single person can look at bootstraping, brainstorming, development and shipping since most products use existing building blocks or they require different folks to execute different parts.

There is far too much much talent at the lower and mid-levels of the company that's not being tapped because of poor management and excessive process.

","Your internship experience will be highly dependent on what team you get put on, which you essentially have no control over. Interning at Microsoft can be really fun (e.g. cool events, swag, networking opportunities). However, it can also be absolutely horrible (e.g. very old tech, lacking mentorship, unsupportive management). Again, the experience will vary from org to org. Some of this can be attributed to lack of diversity. For example, if an org is 80-90% a specific race/culture, it's more likely you'll be met with huge cultural and generational differences and individuals/managers who perpetuate bias and stereotypes.

Assign better mentors to interns, or provide more training to potential mentors. Implement more structured intern onboarding per org.

Super flexible timings and weekends are almost always free of work. Everyone leaves work early, so no peer pressure to work late hours. Relaxed and professional work culture. Good benefits, good workspaces.
","1. Average skill of engineers in India isn't particularly amazing.
2. Compensation is decent but not amazing. The stock component is more than the cash, which will irk some as every stock grant vests over four years.
3. There is also some pressure to make your own contributions visible.
4. Evaluation of an engineer's skill isn't really great. You might be a superstar but evaluated as above-average, or you might be below-average but evaluated as ""great"". Managers usually don't have a clue about the technical details of your work.
5. Some people might find the work culture too formal, especially when coming from a startup-esque environment.
6. The engineering systems and codebases are really complex with a lot of inter-dependencies. This can frustrate people coming from smaller-scale products or companies.
Advice to Management
Managers don't have enough good information to properly evaluate an engineer's skill and contributions. Their evaluation relies heavily on ""finished work item count"" and peer feedback. This can be skewed.

","No way you are getting promoted, they keep saying you are good boy, yet: no budget, someone else was promoted, you are missing something (all pillars are very subjective). Lowballing base: if you initially have low package, it won't change in years. Enormous quotas for emerging/adverse regions. SMC management is extremely pure: no experience, no vision, feels like they were hired just because MS couldn't afford someone better. Gigantic pile of other 'funny moments': super low merits, lateral moves, SMC stock options are 10x lower than normal MS, quota numbers can be added on the fly due to 'adjustments', etc.

2020-08-26, Software Engineer,"Redmond, WA","Current Employee, more than 3 years",10xer getting tired of the facade,"- Good side benefits & employee perks
- Nearly unlimited learning resources and material
- MSFT stock has been killing it
- Great products to be proud of
- General trend and direction of MSFT overall has been good
- Rewarding and fun experience, provided you have a good manager
","- Compensation is not competitive unless you get bonuses. They will make up reasons not to give you good bonuses, despite going above and beyond and delivering beyond expectations
- Your enjoyment at Microsoft depends entirely on your manager and skip-level manager
- Microsoft is driven from the top-down culture, nothing bubbles up unless your managers do it for you (and they're too scared to disagree with VPs)
- ""Yes"" culture and lying in Azure. Facades and half baked solutions because everything is rushed to simply get the MVP to answer ""yes"". You will find your managers and developers lying ALL the time to look better on the surface.
- Nepotism & bro culture - They pretend that they are fixing this issue but you will still find a significant amount of teams that only hire the same race and gender (generally men). These teams have been around for over 5 years and they have no interest in changing that dynamic.
- Odd situations where female leadership will promote only women, regardless of the actual work they're doing and merit.
- No actual career growth as a 10xer. It's completely made up and they will still fit you into a box designed by HR.
- Random VPs and principals getting promotions or laid-off mid-year out of the blue. No justification or input from us below, just behind the scene handshake deals between nepotists. You're at the mercy of these re-orgs as attitudes shift and people up above start revealing their true colors.
- Toxic unproductive employees or managers exist and are ignored and unchecked. Don't waste your time with HR unless you plan on lawyering up yourself.
- For both internal and external products that have terrible infrastructure, its always due to poor management chains and lack of feedback loops.

They give you a health savings account and reimburse you for fitness stuff yearly
","They have slowly moved away from being for their employees. They took lunches and made them shorter, much shorter! Then they stretched hours made them longer much longer. You use to work m-f but they took that away as well.
12 hour shifts 30 minute lunch 4-3 days a week. If you have a family it’s not very family friendly schedule as well all know kids are only out of school during summer and weekends.

You really have no room for advancement but they preach that you do.

They on a coporate level have good values but at a working level those are not displayed

If your a female you will really struggle. Females are not treated fairly or given as many opportunities.

Holiday pay doesn’t cover your time off work anymore. Sick time only covers a staffing model of people who work 8 hours not 12.
Advice to Management
If you’re going to mandate longer hours you shouldn’t be shortening people’s breaks.. You can’t promote a work life balance by saying here’s longer hours and we are taking your lunches but hey you get more days off. When in actuality we are now spending more time at work working 4 hours to be exact In every pay period, which in a year is a 104 hours.

You set us hard workers who keep the business running up for failure.

Leadership recognizes the value of cognitive difference and works hard to leverage the strengths of every team member.
","Microsoft's recent drive to be more competitive and relevant has required a lot of adaptability to meet industry demands, unfortunately MS leadership's response to this has been near constant reorgs. Constantly having to pivot workstreams and reestablish coworker relationships drains on moral. If you join with a passion to work on a certain project, odds are you won't be working on it for more then 6 months.

2020-08-15, Architect,,Current Employee,Working in Microsoft India Global delivery,"I have spent more than a decade at Microsoft Global services, now IGD (India Global Delivery). To thrive here and achieve success in terms of promotion, moving up roles, moving up in levels you need one of the following.
1. Be a relative, friend, neighbor, family close to any of LT folks Delivery manger, Service practice leader, Director.
2. Be a diversity.
If you are very hard working, politically right, not direct, flexible, intelligent and be innocent, you may have some success but not guaranteed.
","1. MS IGD is a private run tight knit group. The LT team has no backbone. They will never standup for their subordinates. This is very true especially in the middle management. Be it the Technical delivery mangers, delivery managers or practice directors.
a. Once you approach them with a problem, you will looked at against company, not have flexible mindset, problem creator. They won’t speak up or try to solve your problem by arguing for what is right, because they don’t want to offend their peers or managers.
b. They bring their own people, friends and families. They want to keep promoting their ALs. I suppose you understand what AL means.
c. They are incorrect collaborators in suit and coat. Most of the folks have been somehow caught warned when trying to take advantage of their diversity subordinate. 
d. They hires lot of machs and college interns. They spend on them taking them to parties. Why???? Because these people will give them good score in MS poll. This way they continue to exist. If these interns, college fresh hires wake up and stand for themselves, the workplace would be much better. They are the future citizens, and they should not get enticed by cheap money, alcohol and shut up. This is how our nation is being managed. Shut the young up and they realize things are out of control. This is how our country was ruled by keeping the young in the dark.
e. The internal job posting is one of the biggest joke. Do you know where you will be posting for job that is already filled in or taken? It’s an eye wash. Name sake they will interview.
2. Msigd Has Been Polluted By Former Msit People
a. There was a organization called GDCI a decade back. This was called as global delivery center India. It became msit later. This team was then merged back to idc later. Now around early 2008 - 2010 many employees copied the CEO, LT of msit, idc and mgsi and sent communication on the reality. These employees exposed how the local people abused other state people, how they promoted their own dna, family friends and built an empire.
b. When this information become wide spread, few people from msit started moving into igd. They started building the same people. This folks, mfs, took on positions like engagement managers, professional development and resource managers and practice leaders and directors.
c. They then converted igd like msit slowly.
3. Only ALs gets promoted, encouraged
a. Soon the same mf, LT folks encourage only people who will do al.
b. They will give 0 rating for people who speak up.
c. They will reprimand people who escalate on folks who are poor performers.
d. They will only encourage diversity colleagues that’s HR policy
All of us need to work 200% to make up for their diversity counterparts. I have also worked and managed many diversity who are real gems. Some of them colleagues are extremely talented, with high aspirations. But the other half need the pass to get promoted, get hike and survive.
4. Its NOT IDC
a. Unlike the lt in idc the lt in igd are non technical, sales, and non it managers who joined from other indian based service companies managing herds.
b. Idc lt is made up of talents similar to our CEO. They were once developers, program managers, product unit mangers and group managers. The mgsi, msgd, igd (multi named ms igd) have leadership who ever managers, team leads in companies like satyam, infosys, wipro, tcs. What can you expect?? 
c. The type of work in ms igd is that of pure consulting. Its about passing information from here and there, understanding customer, selling yourself and your team, lobbying ms products, delivery some solution to the customer. Unlike idc where there is lot of technical work, and hands on hard core development
Better together in this journey and better further from igd, Take care.

There is always something new to learn, agility is a mantra and rarely you do same things twice. They promote a great culture of collaboration and, even if it might get confusing at times, it's fun.
","The main con I see is the stakeholder management. In my 10+ years of career in IT, I have not seen such a big contrast between empowering and narrow-minded. Because whatever your role is, you will be exposed to many projects and people, this will constantly follow you. It's disappointing to see people that, despite their seniorship,) are acting shallowly and act dictatorial, refusing to embrace any change or accept other views than their own. These people drag the company down and make others lose motivation.

- Strong growth opportunities
- Large emphasis on networking
- Clear role expectations
- Safety nets and support for employees who experience unsavory work situations
- New challenges every day and consistent recognition of accomplishments by peers and leadership.
","- The only constant is change, which can become exhausting. The strong direction from senior leadership mitigates much of the ""con"" in this, though.
- Administrative and select business operation roles are hourly, so the role does not receive bonuses/stock.

Executive management: Reconsider the transition from several years back that moved business operation roles to an hourly format from salaried.

Senior management: Help drive clarity to the team at large. Many entry- and mid- level employees could use more exposure to you and your peers. 

Immediate management: Lean on your administrators for more stretch projects - we are happy to assist and appreciate the opportunity to grow more in our role.

Recommend
CEO Approval
Business Outlook
Pros
1. Compensation / Benefits
2. Collaboration amongst team members/peers
3. Flexibility in work hours
4. Great to work for a company that is really trying to improve the world (reduce carbon footprint, thrust is on empowering every person and organization to do more, etc.)
Cons
1. Internal tools are ineffective and significant effort is wasted doing day to day job due to tools issues (unless the issues directly impact revenue, no one cares if a project manager spends 6-8 hours per week trying to fix issues due to poor tools)
2. Of all managers I've had in my career, the worse ones have been at Microsoft by far - seriously, lower level or mid-level managers are terrible and since we change managers every year and sometimes more, anyone that has been a Microsoft a while has had experience with several managers.
3. Expect delivery to go well when more than half the team is inexperience and right out of college (but the customer rates don't reflect that). Customers DO notice and the delivery team takes a hit by constant customer complaints
4. Inability to staff engagements in adequate time
5. Being the best qualified does not matter - and this could be the downfall of consulting
Advice to Management
Take a look at many of the managers that have consultants and project managers under them to assess if these managers have any interest whatsoever in the people they manage.

2020-07-13, Exchange Support Engineer,"San Jose, San Jose, San Jose","Former Employee, more than 1 year",Want to support a dying technology while managing an enormous backlog of cases?,"This MS under Satya is currently one of the best places to work if you are lucky enough to be under the Azure umbrella.
Even for support, Azure itself it a friendly environment for growth, exposition and job security. Azure is not going anywhere, it is here to stay.
","Where do I start... micromanagement is barely one of the first issues.
Exchange On-premises is a dying solution, and also water is wet. 
MS is no longer investing in  On-premises solution and it's employees, even Exchange Online support is abandoned. 
Ok so let's get real, if you are to work as an Exchange On-premises Support Engineer, prepare yourself for:
1- Micromanagement, even from the Upper guys. I remember one of the big guys scolding our TA just because, can anyone tell me what is the reason for the existence of 1st line managers? they barely do anything by the way, even when the water was up to neck.
2- Almost every Support Engineer goal there is to leave, really. Even seniors are leaving to be PFE's or Support Engineers on Azure, if you are lucky. 
3- Prepare for long calls. I remember 6 hours calls with clients to be the quite recurrent. Oh and good luck having proper training.
4- Documentation is getting removed for some reason, so good luck when supporting Exchange 2010-2013. Hell, even the newest Exchange 2019 barely has any good doc.
5- No incentive, I started there with another co-worker at the same time, we both received the same incentive and raise... like what is the point of all 1-1 and Connects? Oh yes, it is just a smoke screen while the oldest members of the team receive the best bonuses because mr manager decided to!
6- This one boils me with anger, promotions are useless. You can get to be a Support Escalation Engineer but prepare yourself to get a raise so low you can barely call that a raise, oh but you must support the worst escalations and complexity known in the history of this godforsaken email solution.
7- I feel so bad for one of my co-workers, he was objectively better than person B, but person B got a promotion that EVERYONE questioned, but well, glad I'm not there anymore.

Please, if you happen to get the opportunity to work as a SE in Exchange, it is not worth it.
I did ran away and my mental health is as better as ever.
Advice to Management
Take a look at yourself and get in the feet of your own people. 
We have to manage 15+ cases while managing critsits, spend 5+ hours daily on the phone, working on weekends, holidays, etc. 
People exposed to this line of work deserve better treatment, or at least make the pain more bearable.
Yes, MS has to support these old Exchange contracts but as you people say ""get all hands on deck"" also refer to you!

If you want to make an impact through technology, Microsoft is one of the great places to work.
","Over 90% of my managers at Microsoft were average to great. But over 20+ years I had three decidedly bad managers. It's totally fine that I worked for managers that I don't get along with; but the problem is that Microsoft gives senior managers a HUGE amount of control over an employee's career path with no checks and balances. If you work for a senior manager with whom you don't get along AND they give you a bad review, then it is very challenging to move forward with your career. HR will listen to your concerns, but they don't have the power to insert you somewhere else. Instead, the new manager will put a lot of weight into the old manager's reviews.

2020-06-30, Senior Program Manager,"Redmond, WA","Former Employee, more than 10 years",Company is moving in many positive directions,"There are tons of opportunities to try something new. Leadership is for the most part focused on understanding employee feedback and acting on it. They are getting better at reacting and moving in new directions as markets shift.
","Still too slow to recognize emerging opportunities, and are stuck in a cycle of responding too slow to make a dent in many markets. Operates as independent ""association of states"" rather than as a cohesive company. Can't seem to figure out how to be in the consumer space, always running in 3rd place. Definitely seeing a shift toward ""going young"" and although not overt about it, older employees are being managed out.
Advice to Management
Focus as much energy on your older work force as you do recruiting the young college hires. Yes they are the future, yes they have a ton of upside, but you have an aging work force who are being told they don't matter. Many people who have been there 25+ years have never been told a real ""thank you"" for their long, dedicated service.

the messages from senior leadership are on point, but middle management aren't doing right by the company.

","Some Managers should not be Managers, and it is appalling how often unprepared individuals are promoted to management positions in Microsoft just by packing the work of peers and presenting that as own work to the right people at the right time. I've seen that again and again.
Once promoted, those individuals make the life of their subordinates a living hell. Only solution to those poor souls is to find another job internally, then life becomes fun again. If you work at Microsoft and see yourself in that situation, change bosses, do not waste time!

2020-06-04," Director, Human Resources Business Partner","Redmond, WA","Current Employee, more than 1 year",Love the company but may need to reconsider future in the function,"There are a great number of reasons to love the company: overall strategic direction set by Satya and big emphasis on culture; work environment, perks, and benefits and really nice team to work with.
","As an HR partner I’ve found the following things to be mindful of:

-Lack of Strategic Connection between HR Leadership team and the broader org. HR Leadership team seems very detached from the business and HR team realities.

Level: HR roles are levels very low in comparison to the leadership teams they support. I’ve been in other organizations where the HR partner role is mapped within a similar peer group as the direct reports to the main business leader supported. In Microsoft, an HR partner is usually between 2-4 levels below those of the supported organization leadership team and +5-7 levels below it’s main business customer. This creates a real gap in the experience/ maturity level of the partner and the supported leadership team, which does not allow the function to really step up at the strategic level the function expects. 

-Workload: HR partner orgs are extremely lean and not only interacting with the direct business customer bit also with a number of COEs in HR, which is similar to other models. However, the big level of variability between one org and the other is such that the HR partner ends up filling a number of gaps without the appropriate resources to do the job. COE’s are also very disconnected to the business strategy and needs which often results in the need to customize. There’s opportunity for better alignment.

Empowerment: Given the two items above, the HR partner role is not as empowered as what I’ve observed in other similar roles with much smaller business scope.

Long work hours: You can expect very long work hours.

Career progression: very slow. Talent stay very long years in their roles. Due to the limited number of VP roles, growing to a leadership level position is very unlikely.

","Unfortunately the corporate business (not the field) have some terrible management in place in the middle layers (Gm, Sr Dir, Dir). Lots of bullying, belittling, zero empathy.. but most important if you speak up, you’re penalized. HR won’t listen, and they protect the company first and foremost so bad managers continue to thrive. It’s a boys club. The favorites get promoted and protected while the ones who want to drive change and speak up for the flaws don’t. MS poll scores don’t matter any more.
Advice to Management
You need an independent review board to make changes to poor management. Take a long hard look at MS Poll scores to see what teams you need to look at.

Flexible work environment.
Lots of interesting and challenging projects.
Ability to switch internal teams within Microsoft.
Work life balance is good.
Job stability, especially during situations like COVID.
","Microsoft is very large company. Getting promotions can be hard, especially if you are in a team with engineers who have been in the same team for 15-20 years.
There are times where your job ca be boring. You might have to deal with lots of legacy code. You frequently get lost and hard to get help when stuck with problem.
Salary and compensation package is great, but compared to other companies like Google, Facebook and other start ups, it is less.
While the offices and facilities are great, workplace feels lonely and disconnected. People stay inside their office most of the time and most of the things are done online without human interaction. This can make the workplace dull and depressing.
Ofcourse, most of the pros and cons will vary from team to team except of things like salary and benefits.
Advice to Management
Although there are few things that can be improved like salary compensation, Microsoft is doing a great job, especially after Sathya became CEO, the company has been growing really well.

Aside from that I couldn't have asked for better perks and work-life balance.
","Usually takes extensive travel to Redmond or extensive traveling in general to be promoted if you are a remote employee. We had 3 different mangers in a year and was going to a 4th before I decided it was enough. It takes time to set up a development path and create a relationship with a manager that knows your efforts and can represent them well. Changing mangement that often is a receipe for wasted efforts and lost morale amongst employees. Although I could have probably coasted for years receiving a great paycheck, I simply wasn't challenged enough. I ended up going to a competitor.
Advice to Management
The more you change managers on senior level employees that are especially trying to get to the next level the more we will be prone to leave. This is especially true from remote employees but applies to regular employees also. There comes a point where significance and personal impact is more important than anything else.

Cons
Zero work life balance.
They don't even ask your consent for weekend works. 
MSGD sucks specially the Business Applications domain. 
No support from your manager / TDM
Useless or unexperienced Dev leads who just wants to make you work day and night.
Never join IGD or MSGD specially in business applications (dynamics) domain. It sucks. I have been working 12 to 14 hours per day. This is just not me everyone works the same here.
No work life balance at all. 
Less pay., less stock level. No stock bonus. 
Every project here is a burning project, I don't know what's wrong with the management. People here are very frustrated and annoyed because of the culture they hold. This really sucks.

2020-04-22,Anonymous,,"Current Employee, more than 8 years",internal review process MS Poll is not anonymous you will have retaliation for negative comments,"Microsoft name turns heads and is good on CV
","Microsoft lies about internal review process called MS Poll which is not anonymous.

Poll is run by third party but all results and who wrote what comments are shared with all management hierarchy and you will suffer in retaliation during next Connect, or manager will make your life hell until you quit.
Reporting to HR is making yourself a target and managers start to ask more about yourself after you report so they probably receive this information.

Excuses like ""fuelling personal growth"" and ""culture of learning"" and ""growth mindset"" or ""I am concerned about you"" are for naive people to be trapped in saying their opinion.

There is no ethics or any culture change, it is just illusion. Anyone expressing discontent is discovered and they are out sooner or later in one way or the other.

Truth is everyone apply to Microsoft because of the good name, so they don't need people, everyone rotates, goes in and out easy, so there is no space for anyone with unhappy opinion.

If you get manager that does not like you, tough luck, keep head down and run away to first team or job you find, you will never have chance staying because managers have all the power and see all the information from HR.

","Although the company overall is exceptional and the goal is straightforward, sometimes the management could get into micro managing their teams. This totally depends on the team you're in. I'd say 90% of the teams have amazing managers and you can easily grow in your career if you have the right attitude.
Advice to Management
Credit where credit is due, appreciation where appreciation is due. But if you begin to appreciate everyone for everything they do everyday (even when it's a part of their day to day job ), the appreciation will eventually lose its value. Going an 'extra-mile' for our customers will carry no significance since appreciation is given even if you show up to office on time.

Business Outlook
Pros
-store managers care about their employees, customers, and company image. They look after their employees and what’s best for them, and not just restricted to company-related issues. They really develop their community.
-Fantastic benefits and bonuses through microsoft
-State of the art tech and laptops on display in the stores
-Great service bar with knowledgeable staff
-Great product advisors with knowledge of the current market
-Most of the team is willing to teach, share knowledge, and get new employees up to speed fast.
Cons
-Some managers are clearly placed through nepotism/politics (like most of retail) and don’t do a great job, but the heart is still there.
-“big company” politics are still very much front and center, sometimes the managers can only do so much to support the store and their team without being overruled by corporate.
-The best of the best of...a retail job.
Advice to Management
-Keep up the heart and care for the employees and the community. They’ll remember it and give back where they can. You are creating an experience that is hard to forget.
-You really really don’t need an employee to verbally greet every customer who enters the store. A visual nod and smile/grimace will do.

Repor","-Keep up the heart and care for the employees and the community. They’ll remember it and give back where they can. You are creating an experience that is hard to forget.
-You really really don’t need an employee to verbally greet every customer who enters the store. A visual nod and smile/grimace will do.

2020-03-24, Principal Member of Technical Staff,"Eagle, ID",Current Employee,Great company.. Silo’d and some empire building.,"Working on massive billion dollar worldwide technology. Fast moving. There is money to fund programs other companies simply can’t afford to do. They also carry massive influence when dealing with vendors.
","The organization has way too many product managers. There is not enough thought to long term investments and technologies that need to be researched. Everything is assumed to be a workable technology and program even if it’s still an experiment.

You can’t program manage technologies that aren’t ready for prime time.

There is also some empire building.
Advice to Management
I’d like to see more investment in the R side of R&D. Not necessarily investing in Microsoft Research, but in technologies that aren’t in the next year. This is especially true as the company invests more in hardware vs software.

- work life balance is there
- cheap food
- great clubs that will get you discounts in concerts
","This feedback is about Digital Sales in Dublin:
- lack of transparency about promotions
- managers can't share the real news
- They will ask you to over achieve but they can't fight for your or for your promotion
- Managers will try to keep you at the lowest level and salary possible, and if you are not happy they will just let you go and hire someone new who will get more than what you used to get.
- New joiners get more attention, salary, and level then the people staying, and believing the career development sessions (that managers will hammer what you have to show, and will always want to keep you)
- Salary increase is a disgrace, it is 1% each year
- Bonus at the end of the year (CBI) is not clear, no transparency how it is calculated

","Most management decisions are gut reactions trying to get parity with the competition. 

Performance review *still* uses forced stack ranking: we still must choose people to be labeled under-performance, no matter what.

Management likes to imitate Facebook or Google in what saves money, such as open offices, but not on what makes them great, such as their performance review system.
Advice to Management
Stop imitating others only on what might save money. Kill the forced curve once and for all. Don't wait until the competition is way ahead of us to take some action.

2020-03-08, Software Data Engineer,"Redmond, WA","Former Employee, more than 10 years","It's all about your connections, the stack rank and the MS bottom line.","If you find a good manager to work for (they're rare), you'll do fine. Comp is decent. That's how it was for me for 18 or so years. Mostly good people solving tough problems in a super-fast paced environment.
","They cut engineering staff by a minimum of 10% every year. No matter what. Even top performers will be asked to go eventually, since they promote folks into a band without their consent (but you'll like it because comp will go way up at first). Also, it was very political at Principal level and higher. I know this because they kept a widely-known dumpster fire of a manager around by consistently reassigning him to other projects. There's more, but I'm saving it for a tell-all book.
Advice to Management
There is no advice I could give to management that they would consider. Too bad they didn't listen to me when I was there. Given the rising stock price, what reason would they have for being ethical now? Why change a good thing with the benjamins rolling in? Your secret is still safe. Sssshhhh...

If you're a good employee, the bosses will be your best friends. If not, they'll crack down on you hard, and only once before you're fired. Just do what you're hired to do, smile, and try your best each day and the work will be a piece of cake. And make sure you're on time. You get a bonus of £5 a day for literally just showing up. The training is great too, I can't tell you how much success I've had due to all the training days they give you. I can't stress this enough- just show them you work hard, and won't get passive after a few weeks- and you're going to have an amazing time.

","HR Has weaponized Inclusiveness and Diversity to mean, ""white men please leave"". And there's a heightened culture of victims in waiting. The statement ""everyone has a personal truth"" means you can get in trouble for anything. There are even policies about words and phrases to use that HR wants you to use, but if those preferred words and phrases offend someone you are in trouble. And there are quiet talks by managers about how the rules are different for white men. One message is that if a white man sees someone of another category harassing or intimidating someone, they aren't allowed to report. 
If you are of a protected class this doesn't apply and you definitely should work at Microsoft. You'll be treated fairly.
Advice to Management
Don't have quotas. Don't make Diversity a marketing campaign. Really work to help employees work out differences together. A hair trigger culture of victimhood is just as hostile an environment as letting the real offenders go.

2020-02-06, Software Engineer,Belgrade,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",Truly an excellent job,"Work - life balance. Flexible hours. Everyone respects the personal time of others. On-call can be an occasional exception to that, but it's inevitable and handled very reasonably. 

Salary and benefits are among the most competitive in the country.

Freedom: You are trusted to figure things out on your own, there's zero micromanagement.

Variety of work: ML, Big Data.. pick any buzzword and someone in MDCS is doing cool work with it. Others are working on serious products that earn an absurd amount of money. There's something for everyone.

Culture: The perfect blend of Western and Serbian culture, amazing, reasonable people.

Meritocracy done right: For everyone I've met so far it was apparent that they more than deserve their position. I haven't observed anyone's talent and hard work going unnoticed.

Management is great. Nobody gets off on their authority.
","Salary: It's great for Serbia, but engineers doing exactly the same work, just as well, inside the same team are being paid significantly more, because they live in a different country. This isn't on MDCS leadership, it's on their bosses for not throwing more money at them. Sure, we are compensated competitively in the local job market, but why does anyone deserve less money for being Serbian instead of American? Now that you've fixed the gender pay gap, fix the ethnicity pay gap. You can afford it. You would also end up capturing some brilliant minds who end up migrating outside the country, often to a rival company, because of the absurd pay difference.

Not a huge obstacle, and more often things are done right, but some development tools and processes BADLY need to be reinvented from scratch. This is not really an MDCS-specific issue though.

The vendor system is not ideal, but not a huge problem, and appears to be going extinct.

Secrecy about salaries - I see no reason.

2. If you work in the Redmond location there are great commute options. 
3. Senior leadership is working actively to change the culture. Not just lip service but holding mangers accountable. 
4. The company is on a growth tear. (Just look at the stock price since Satya Nadella became CEO)
5. The benefits are amazing and getting even better.
","There is a layer of management that has been here for 15+ AND is entrenched in a 'good old boys' culture. If you tow the line and kiss the ring you will be fine. Your good ideas are theirs and your bad ones are yours. 

Your career fate is tied to your manager. Promotion, growth and rewards are impacted by your impact on the business and equally on your ability to kiss the ring. Make sure you have a manager that supports you or quickly find another manager. 

My advice is don’t take any role that doesn’t have high visibility. Avoid any role that involves the regular running of the business. That is thankless work.

If culture and inclusion are important to you, avoid Microsoft for now. If this doesn't matter, welcome on board.
Advice to Management
Culture. Change is coming but too slow. Hard work is more rewarding in an inclusive environment. Kudos to those who have put in 15+ years to build the company. With that this is no reason to view new guard as a disruption but as an asset to the growth of your stock price.

2020-01-29, Senior Market Research Manager,,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",3.5 Stars if I could,"Work-life balance is typically what you make it. They (both Corp and stakeholders) will take as much of your time as you are willing to give, so know your boundaries and set them early.

The pay is good relative to competitors. The benefits are excellent. You work with intelligent, collaborative people (mostly). You might be able to move on to a different role within the org or with another group like Engineering.

The new GM of CMR as of Fall 2019 seems genuinely interested in improving culture and providing development opportunities, which is promising.

No commute into downtown Seattle. :)
","Middle management is a mixed bag. I've heard some managers are great and others are definitely not so great. Management with long tenure is a double-edged sword as institutional knowledge is valuable but it allows bad habits or practices to become more deeply ingrained. There doesn't seem to be any training for managers on how to actually manage high performing teams which definitely causes attrition. 

While official stack-ranking is no longer a thing, promotions are still largely dependent on favoritism (or fear of losing strong talent) rather than basic merit, as managers do not adhere to the promotion or level guidelines published by HR. At each people review more employees are put up for promotion than can realistically be promoted due to budget. 

Not specific to CMR, but across Microsoft, there aren't any mechanisms for providing feedback on your skip manager. Internal surveys ask about immediate manager and group manager, but that doesn't capture the entirety of the employee experience.

As a new hire at a low level, I was discriminated against assigning worthy work. I'm guessing it is easy for them to justify the discrimination citing my level. No promotions for the same reason.

Be careful of joining a team with terrible seniors who are stuck there. You need nothing more for a screwed up career at Microsoft.

","The Communications Organization at Microsoft is like a sorority-house where all the individuals are white and come from the same agency. They're not very analytically-minded at all and shun all from any other backgrounds. They gossip constantly because they are not rationally-minded and are terrible at mathematics. They're also all from the PNW and seem to have trouble with people with having individuals from other parts of the world, resulting in an incredibly insular and ignorant culture. The male leadership is pretty sexist.
Advice to Management
Maybe consider hiring some individuals who are actually people of color in Communications? You preach diversity and inclusion, but your organization doesn't really reflect it...maybe that's why you're experiencing budget cuts/ your individual salaries are so low compared to the rest of Microsoft! Also...pick up a math textbook some time, so your communications aren't so airy and not based on any sort of solid data.

","There is much personal resentment created on basic misinterpretation of people, which lead to poisoning the teams agains one person due to personal dislike or personal disagreement in ideas. Persecution , unethical behavior up to the point of gossiping from the top, General managers and business leads and down the chain.
Personal persecution is not uncommon and men have the tendency to abuse females, more so if they are nonwhite, from account executives to their colleagues and misinformation gets passed on to managers, which they take action without verification due to their remote status (living in a different state) and delegating all work to your team members, who do not wish to help.

From business leads to management only look at their monetary incentives and are willing to sacrifice anyone who gets in their ultimate bottom line, MONEY!
Advice to Management
DO NOT Ignore business trends of government and look at the customer base for failure. Everything depend on the TAM, and MANAGEMENT attaches negatives to TAM WITHOUT looking at customer trends and behavior to make rational conclusions.

","I reported abuse to HR and was fired after a year
The managers at this company play politics and don't focus on anything remotely like work. There is an overwhelming focus on aging out at microsoft because the pay is good - meaning all the people there are focused on simply staying around until 55 and they continual fire fresh teams to prevent any challenge.
Advice to Management
Satya is good but is clearly not pressuring the company to change in the ways he publically espouses. His workforce is not diverse and consistently behaves like the balmer era mediocre men.

2020-01-13, Corporate Account Executive,"Irving, TX","Former Employee, more than 1 year",Digital Sales Irving TX is a mixed bag,"Microsoft really does have Cadillac benefits - generous 401k matching, best dental insurance I’ve ever had, personal wellness, ESPP etc. Due to the name recognition and company footprint, it’s generally easy to get appointments with your customers, as they are heavily invested in Microsoft technology. Microsoft seems to be continuously innovating their tech as of late, which is helpful to sellers.
","Microsoft’s inside sales org in Irving, TX is called Digital Sales within Microsoft’s Small, Medium & Corporate business segment. 
When I joined Microsoft, I expected a world class and extremely formalized training program since the company was so large and talks about digital transformation with their customers. Microsoft was the worst and most impersonal onboarding I’ve ever had. They had you do a quick 2 hour meeting with an HR rep, and from there, you’re released to your manager. On day 1, I had boxes of equipment at my desk and was left to unpack and set up all my equipment myself. No one helped me get up and running to ensure I had a successful first day in role. 
Outside of the standard education videos, which are all more Microsoft and product focused, there was no formalized training to set external hires up for success within Microsoft digital sales. 
It surprised me that for a tech company, the sales tools available are very archaic and systems do not talk to one another. For example, I spent the first 2-3 weeks of my job entering Help Desk tickets with India just to wait on various system access and tools needed to perform my job. This added to what’s already a stressful time starting a new job. Dynamics is a very antiquated CRM tool (basically an electronic filing cabinet) & was cumbersome to maintain accurate sales records in the tool. 
Management within the org was highly political and would impose constantly shifting priorities that worked well for those in leadership to meet their scorecard metrics by creating business rules that forced reps to sell certain products for a management scorecard and jump through countless internal approval hoops if the product was not included in a deal. This led to many reps selling through discounting versus solution selling - setting a bad precedent for future deals. 
There was also a shift in how the specialists teams interact with the digital Account Executives. Some of the specialists used to be AEs and work as field-based resources, while other AEs have 100% inside-based specialists supporting their accounts. Seems like eventually Microsoft will pivot to eliminating either one group of resources or the other in the future. As a result, mandates come down for the AEs to upskill by taking various certification exams to achieve deeper proficiency in the workloads. This is fine, but it makes you wonder if the goal is eventually to try and eliminate some of the specialists. Often, it felt like they were trying to pile as much on the AE as possible when the AE role was explained to me as a generalist sales role. 
Many of the managers within digital sales are extremely duplicitous and political, which created a hostile work environment. Policies would be implemented very haphazardly without the proper training and context for the AE community to fully understand the new policies and adhere to them. 
Since it’s Microsoft, there are also a TON of resources (usually contractors) reaching out internally asking you to intro them to your customers or bothering you constantly to let them engage in your accounts. The issue is many of these resources are also inconsistent and not showing value, so you are having to filter through a ton of internal noise and requests for introductions on top of your daily work. 
The majority of the folks there seemed to be hanging on from when Microsoft first opened this sales org due to the relatively high pay for inside sales; however, many of these employees lack the basic skills and Microsoft knowledge to effectively do their job and take care of their customers - they are just there riding the wave. 
I’d advise against the Digital Sales AE role and Specialist roles in Las Colinas unless you’re have worked heavily in the Microsoft ecosystem and come to the role with that background and knowledge of what you are getting into. If you come from another software company, you will likely not get the enablement your need to effectively navigate the complexities of Microsoft and management’s constantly shifting priorities.
Advice to Management
- provide better new hire training - just because you hire professionals doesn’t automatically mean they know Microsoft. Train them on the tools to do the day-to-day job and how to get things done internally at Microsoft as part of being a new hire. 
- enforce more consistent expectations across all first line managers and teams on the sales floor, as it currently seems like some teams and individuals are great and others aren’t 
- improve and streamline tools internally that are rolled out and needed to do your job - centralize tooling as much as possible 
- provide avenues for AEs to have better access to support for concerns about their job and getting things done 
- prevent first line managers from hiring a team of people composed exclusively of reps from a single company - ensure managers have diversity in backgrounds across their teams versus just hiring their former coworkers or friends 
- try to maintain a little more continuity in business policies and expectations and insulate reps more from the noise that can come from misinformation and constantly shifting business priorities

I have worked as a so-called FTE in the second team only (not an agency employee - typical for HR), so I will give feedback on the second role. 
I have worked for Dynamics for more than 2 years now. It is a team I fell in love with, it is fairly big, more than 100 team members. Each one can enjoy a lot of benefits MS and this team provides us - travel to visit office in Redmond or to attend a conference. 
All FTEs have stocks, new hardware and add-ons. 
The office is just amazing, refreshements provided on daily basis, a lot of events (something each month whether it is Halloween, New Year's party or a release party to celebrate the success of the team). 
Nice swag, training (Colour training or How to present training), so-called Garage where you can devote time to your own projects, safe and modern office with adjustable desks if you need, bike lcokers, garages, e-bikes to borrow, etc.
Buddy system for the new comers, manager leadership and check-points, boy, a lot of stuff right there at the end of your fingers.
","Ocassional work in the evening to be able to meet up with the US colleagues. There is a system in place though to mantain the life-work balance but it is unavoidable from time to time. You can start your day whenever you want though as well - let it be 11 if you work late that date so I guess it is OK.

Pros
1. Decent package
2. Employee benefits
3. Brand name
Cons
1. Internal politics
2. Zero initial training
3. People are not at all helpful.
4. No team spirit (more competition and less collaboration) 
5. Nobody tells you the process. No single point of contact.
6. Gender discrimination (even senior lady employees are struggling to prove themselves)
7. In-depth hierarchy (you can't do anything if your manager thinks you are not meeting expectations, which can even be to ""act"" working for 16 hrs regularly)
8. Appraisal system is not at all justified and also unfair (for a small appraisal you will be given the answer that ""you are already earning a lot"")
9. 360-degree review is a joke.
10. Also, a cherry on the cream - some people can't control themselves in office-party and won't mind grabbing you after a few drinks.
Advice to Management
Microsoft is in downfall (might not be tech-wise but people-wise). I can't even compare its work culture to new startups where even though there is huge pressure but people talk to each other with respect and know the definition of ""Team"". Also, the appraisal system is screwed and hierarchy taking it down further. I would have never come to know what is a good working culture if I have never left MICROSOFT.

Pay more to your talent if you want to retain talent and high quality engineers. As a result of your subpar pay, majority of the engineers are mediocre. If you want higher quality products, then its in your best interest to hire and maintain top talent, for which you need to pay more money. Higher salaries will also motivate engineers to work harder to create higher quality products.

I was brought into Microsoft with a Red Team both through Orientation and Boot Camp. I was hired into Technical Sales. During that time I observed compliance practices which were poor. I observed that sales would lie regarding the use of ECIF funds and that women were discriminated against as well as that they were harassed during conferences. I found that Microsoft is truly the ""old boys"" network and when my brother went missing I was not allowed bereavement leave during the time I asked for it because I was on a project I could not be spared. When I finally finished I was terminated. I am in my 50's I have a disability and I was fired and not given access to COBRA.

","IDC doesn't have the great culture that's present in Redmond under Nadella. Office teams in general have much more politics compared to Azure and Bing. But Office Exchange team is in next level. They selected managers and director with zero managerial experience who are always complaining and shouting in meetings.

The team is so bad that during recent Reorg/Shuffle, 10 people out of 13 left the team. No one is willing to come to this team. Work is decent but the management behavior makes it suffocating to work.

If you are under their radar remember they won't even allow team change - by putting a false tag of under-performer and giving bad Connect review and then fire you. So its better to avoid joining this team in the first place.
Advice to Management
Whoever is joining Microsoft Office team ensure that you don't join Exchange at any cost if you want long term career in Microsoft.

Noida office is a poorly crafted incubation centre with ton of daily problems, Hyderabad and Bangalore office are awesome workplaces. Easy to move to Redmond office after a certain grade. Fairly frequent onsite travel
","If you are good at what you do you might be disappointed as you will be exploited badly by credit stealing managers. Also high achievers will not be recognised or will be rated well below someone who talked nice with manager. Even if recognised, additional pay will be peanuts. Mediocre and political people are valued and they sideline hardworkers. No 360 degree appraisal giving autocratic powers to managers. Promotions decided mostly by gut feeling than performance. IDC managers are muzzled by Redmond. Very rarely can they standup with genius. Satya is trying to change the culture for good but old managers are spoiling any effort in IDC with their wicked mentality. People are sticking simply because of the balance of pay, facilities, and work. Be prepared for repurcussions if you disobey. 😊
Advice to Management
Managers in IDC are rotten so deep that a few motivation talks or culture change drives by Satya is barely reaching the ground. Average manager barely care for their reports but instead try to extract for their own benefit. MS does surveys to get information like these but despite raising them no action are taken and each passing day the top down management gets stronger to dismiss the honest and performers.

Be open, understand what technical people valuate the most. If you know technical people you know that many of them use to work very late at night, at lunch, at weekends etc. just because they like it.

2019-12-22, Technical Account Manager,"Gurgaon, Haryana, Haryana","Current Employee, more than 10 years",Technical Account Manager,"The opportunity to work with people smarter than me.
The projects and technology under development always inspire me. Almost every event I’ve gone to has had me come away wanting to look into some other cool technology and thinking of the ways it can change the world.
A real career path of whatever you want to be.
Chance to change projects whenever I want. During my interviews, many people were quite open with me: they get bored with a project eventually and want to switch after two years or so. Microsoft’s culture easily allows this.
Compete with Google. Google needs some real competition. Just as Firefox lit a fire under the IE team, MS needs to light a fire under Google.
The benefits are awesome. They truly treat you well.
They are extremely open on telecommuting.
How many companies can you work at where your stuff affects so many people? There aren’t that many…
The challenge. I love challenges. I love learning new things, and working hard to solve problems. Challenges are how you grow.
","Environments vary depending on where and for whom you work. One of the most common complaints are the review rankings which in one form or another exist. They are said to have ended but they do continue in the background. Every organization, regardless of results, is required to identify a given percentage of employees to receive an unsatisfactory performance rating.. This held true for those organizations that excelled and those that failed. One would think failing organizations would be penalized requiring a higher percentage of unsatisfactory ratings, but they were not. Go in eyes wide open realizing your performance is measured relative to your peers.

","Salaries are really crappy compared with other comanies in the local market, and doesn't live up to the fact that MS is a big corporation, that can offer more to retain its talents.

Advice to Management
Please place more thought to offering more competitive salaries, it is not nice when you force good talent to leave the company because you're paying them pennies. The attrition rate is very high and losing people every year hurts the business, because now you need to backfill with people with no experience and you pay them more than what you would have payed the people you lost.

Pros
1. Opportunities to be an Individual Contributor.
2. Flexible work from home option. One can work for months from home.
Cons
1. Detrimental Politics. People will be very good in front of you. but back stab you. For some reason, few managers encourage playing all politics. Most of the time they gossip about others and about their personal lives.
2. Demoralizing with negative and false comments. People who maintain good rapport with managers by nodding to everything they say will get great reviews. Others will be demoralized with negative statements about their work.
3. Less opportunities to work on different projects and technical stacks.
4. Lack of transparency. Both in projects and people management, there will be no transparency. No one will have idea on who is working on what module. No one will have a clue on what it takes to reach to next career level. Do not get surprise if someone steals the credit for your work. 
5. Unnecessary escalations. People escalate for everything and anything, even if it is a low priority defect. Very common to see harsh conversations.
Advice to Management
Please reconcile and retrospect the current processes related to people management. There is high attrition rate at IGD because of some managers are failing in identifying people's hard work.

Other managers, in attempts to justify their own roles and existence, make up side projects for mid to upper management that never serve a purpose to our clients yet they cannot perform the basics in their own role. Leadership is incompetent enough to fall for this charade time and time again, meanwhile the managers that aren’t busy brown nosing are the ones keeping the business afloat. This is the worst organization I’ve ever been a leader in and if I had to do it again I would never have become a manager here. Run away before you get sucked into this dumpster fire of fifedoms, favorites, and meaningless work.
Advice to Management
Satya needs to intervene with the disaster that is services and either reorg it to streamline it or sell it off entirely. Most of the middle management needs to leave the company, they simply regurgitate the messages that come from Satya but fail to ever actually live up to our values.

Advice to Management
Don't let managers delay employees move. More competent people are let go because they are a threat to their managers. Managers should see them as an asset rather than employees who can surpass them. Employees will leave and then come back so to get the position they are qualified for and want. Problem is some leave and never come back and MS is worse off. Stop thinking partners can do everything your employees can. If you think they can, then we should get a p-CEO, and p-CFO.

Because pressure is very high there is no time for human relations. It's every one for himself, almost no helping one each other, even in the same project.

I will not recommend working there unless u willing to sacrifice your time for work.

2019-11-03, Software Engineer,"Seattle, WA","Current Employee, more than 1 year",Customer Focused Engineering,"Competitive compensation, job stability, work-life balance, high visibility products
","Bad architecture due to Microsoft's unwillingness to do full rewrites. End up building on top of badly designed software which leads to further bad design decisions to make it work. Technical debt is ever increasing which makes it feel like a losing battle. Product focus is on delivering new features in time to compete with AWS at the expense of engineering quality.

Internal tooling is pretty awful. There's many tools that achieve the same functionality, and each team uses them differently. It makes engineering productivity extremely low, senior engineers can overcome these mostly by building their own hacky tools.
Advice to Management
Need more alignment in the engineering department. Monorepo would be a great addition. There's lots of friction with cross-team dependency because of bad documentation and bad architecture. If we had more visibility/control over other teams' work, cross-team collaboration could be improved vastly.

It's a great company to settle into and work for that lets you move around industries and products without having to change your email address. It's easy to have a lifetime career here and never get bored doing the same thing over and over.
","Microsoft is a very political system to navigate and work through. Often times there's a lot of red tape to go through for each decision which requires hours of meetings and alignment. It sometimes feels like you're doing your hardest to get the job done while others are doing their hardest to undo what you've done, it's not for the faint of heart. This can often mean you spend all day in meetings getting nothing done, only to find you have to spend the rest of your evenings and weekends working and stressing over how others are going to undo that work.

2019-10-23, AI Resident,"Cambridge, East of England, England, England","Former Employee, less than 1 year",Proud to have been Microsoft,"I am immensely proud to have worked for Microsoft Research. Microsoft has admirable principles as to how they relate with both their customers and employees, always keeping as priority respect and care for client data, as well as consideration for employees’ well-being. While there, I have participated in many social events organised by the company, received many benefits and had multiple opportunities to engage into activities focusing on my professional and individual growth.

The work/research aspect is also very gratifying at Microsoft. By working at one of the largest software producers in the world, I had the opportunity to work beside brilliant researchers and software engineers, use state-of-the-art equipment, software and algorithms, as well as get to know about and work in exciting and futuristic research projects. 

Additionally, I have great respect for Microsoft’s policy for publication. They highly encourage their researchers to publish their findings, but only when there is actually something to be said, always supporting high quality work and prioritising prestigious academic journals and/or conferences. Contrary to an increasing trend in academia, Microsoft does not pressure their employees to publish for the sake of publishing, which consequently increases their credibility and ensure they always add meaningful and reproducible contributions to the scientific community.

I highly recommend Microsoft Research if you are looking forward to working on exciting and meaningful research, beside brilliant and friendly people, and under a culture of respect, transparency and well-being.
","I have participated in the very first year of a newly implemented RSE (Researcher Software Engineer) trainee program at Microsoft Research called AI Residency. Because I was in the first round of this program, I have witnessed issues in many aspects its management, which I believe is absolutely natural. Again, it was the very first year of this program, and so they had to make use of trial and error in many management aspects that they had no previous experience to base themselves on. More important than the mistakes made is the fact that Microsoft was highly invested in learning with such mistakes, always concerned in getting our sincere feedback to adjust the program in order to improve our experience and the experience of the future AI residents.

2019-10-20, N/A,Sydney,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",Highly Toxic Management in Australia,"Salary, felxibility to work from home
","The Australian sub has gone through a terrible change over 2019 and needs a good shake up, the culture is like IBM in the 90s or like a chapter written by Jack Welch. Back stabbing, lack of transparency, a lot of insecure people who throw others under a bus to save themselves and I am talking about the leadership teams.
There is also an unrealistic expectation of travel, the company does not care about your personal life or your family despite saying they do, they act as though they own you. It feels very much like a cult and it is a very toxic environment in Australia at least.
Lastly I want to highlight I saw a lot of poor treatment of people by management while HR turned a blind eye. Hiring of people in roles that were already filled by other people. Being told one day you are performing well, then the next day being pulled into HR meetings to say you were not meeting expectations. Roles are being downgraded by 2 levels forcing people to leave so management can hire their friends. Or worst yet people made redundant one week and two weeks later asked to come back. No one knows where they stand all while the numbers are crashing.
Steer clear of this company until they clean up management.
Advice to Management
Clean sweep the Australia LT, it is an underperforming management team that have a culture completely against the global company vision.

Make developers feel like their company wants to keep them and believes they have the talent to work on any team that has a position for their job title. That's the way it is at other big companies like Facebook and Amazon.

Advice to Management
While not directed at the immediate managers in-store, as they have very little power over this, the company needs to learn that product advisors are more valuable than they are given credit for. Too often, developers look down on product advisors as retail employees without understanding that we are capable of so much more than just working a till system. In fact, we outshine developers on a regular basis in terms of our ability to interact face-to-face with customers and teach them how to use every Microsoft product that customer might need, whether it be windows 10, office 365, office 365 for business, virtual reality, mixed reality and HoloLens, powerbi, outlook customer manager, invoices, Microsoft forms, sway, Minecraft: education edition, xbox, of course every piece of surface hardware, and much more. We are generalists who represent the entirety of the company in both the customers we interact with and expertise we are required, simply as a part of our job description, to maintain a working knowledge of. As a trillion dollar company, there is no excuse for this company to not be paying these employees living wage by now, especially as even more responsibilities are tagged onto the end of the list of duties we are expected to perform each quarter.

3. Best suit for you if you have the right blend of business and tech acumen.
4. The work culture is good and rewards you well if you create the right impact.
","1. The leadership team is unstable and sometimes lacks clarity. 
2. The GSMO Org is not a good fit for people aspiring to be Researchers, Developers, Support Engineers, Consultants or just pure Techies. 
The positions here demand mixed skills.
3. The end goal is achieving business targets. Your performance totally depends on those targets and hence your job security.

2019-09-27, Digital Advisor,"London, England, England","Former Employee, more than 8 years","A great company to work for, with the usual big company obstacles","I worked in Microsoft Services both in the UK and latterly in APAC for 10 years. It was a great experience all round - fantastic knowledgeable colleagues, access to leading edge technology, lots of emphasis on learning and development, fair salary and good overall package. I am an alumni member and have colleagues and friends that I continue to interact with on both a professional and personal basis. 

As an employer, Microsoft are very tuned into the diversity and inclusion agenda and this has grown over the years. On the whole, I had some great managers (I had a couple of terrible ones also, but that happens everywhere).

Satya Nadella is a fantastic CEO and a great leader who is transforming the company.
","The culture in the different Microsoft subsidiaries varies tremendously between the different geographies - some embrace the overall corporate culture and some reflect a more local culture. I switched between the UK and APAC and although it was an amazing experience in hindsight, the company did not prepare me for this in any way.

In an organisation with so many great people, it is difficult to get noticed *just* by doing a good job. You have to be prepared to go the extra mile and work out your own personal style and brand within the organisation, which isn't for everyone.
Advice to Management
A commitment to diversity is great, however age diversity is somewhat overlooked and I think Microsoft lose some great people because they don't understand their value and how they can contribute.

For people who like to play politics - you might get promoted nicely there.
","Everything. Lower management is terrible, upper management even worse. They don't give a damn about people. Only money and work is important. Forget about good bonuses if you don't agree to work like 60 hours a week - excelling at your job in normal work hours is not enough for good bonus or a promotion. People who agree to do that are praised by managers and put on the pedestal, ruining the work culture.

The work itself in Dynamics is horrible. As a person working mostly on both front-end and back-end, I have learned literally no skills that would be helpful for me outside of MS. Back-end is a bit better but you're discouraged to think out of the box.

Compensation is not competitive considering how dreadful the work is.

When I talked to a co-worker (a fellow Product Advisor) about it she forwarded the email she was sent, that DETAILED MY TIME IN HOSPITAL as the reason for my FIRING, sent from my BOSS.

Work with smart people
Benefits are great
Great place to learn about latest technology
","Demanding schedule. 
Due to highly competitive nature there is a lack of collaboration
High expectations without a concrete goal - often times, managements expects you to work hard, make impact etc, without any clear goal or objective. 
Not the best place for women for a long term career. Microsoft in general is trying hard to improve its image about gender bias, however, in technical role, with close to 90% male employees it is not a good environment for women to stay long term. 

For short term this is a great place to learn and having experience in Microsoft goes a long way in your resume. I would recommend Microsoft as a place to start your career, then, have a exit strategy before you burn out. 
The culture and work schedule / demand will take up most if not all of your time. This is a highly competitive place and demands all your attention and energy, which in turn can cause lot of stress. As long as you can work hard to get the great review, this will be a good place for you. You should plan to leave as soon as you realize that you are not able to keep up with the demand.

","Management - it's only one word, that describe - DRAMATIC.

You cannot have own opinion, own style of work - only what is expected, to do exactly things in the way corp says to you. Reporting to Russian management without any understanding of Polish Customers and mentality causing lots of difficulties and very toxic atmosphere - things like working from home are not welcome, taking vacations neither.

CEE Account Team Inside Sales has nothing to do with Microsoft values and working style.
Advice to Management
Change manager for someone who has open mind and knowledge about market - CEE Accounts Team is not Russian subsidiary, and what is most important - listen to your people, otherwise team will be rotating again and again, because nobody can stand this toxic atmosphere.

Business Outlook
Pros
Great benefits, sometimes great clients you get to work with, and fun/exciting events going on. Not a hard job if you know technology or how to use their programs
Cons
Little to no advancement, corporate doesn't care about you, HR is a joke and only helps the interests of the store not the employees, They tend to only hire people from outside the company instead of promoting from within. Management is so disconnected with how to run things because they only care about the bottom line, as well as management doesn't listen to ideas/feedback from their employees, and the pay is a joke for how much is expected of you to do.
Advice to Management
Stop hiring people from outside the company for positions, and try to find candidates from within the company. Pay your employees more for the work they do, Redo your HR so it's more effective with helping employees, and have management actually listen to ideas/feedback from their employees.

2019-08-31,Anonymous,Singapore,"Current Employee, more than 3 years",Middle management bullying and politics,"- Flexible, working from home accepted and encouraged, however takes more effort to establish work relationships.
- Benefits are good when compared to non-IT companies.
","- Many silos in the company with obscure roles. This is a place for people to hide their incompetence, particularly middle management. 

- Bullying is dismissed when escalated to senior leadership. HR function largely outsourced and impersonal. There are pages of instructions on what to do and how grievances are handled but no clear accountability. 

- Incredibly political and bureaucratic. It’s about who you know to get ahead, not your merits or performance. If your manager does not support you (or worse still, take credit for your work) you won’t get anywhere. 

- Feedback is ignored. 

- If you’re ambitious and want to make a difference or grow in your career, don’t come here. You’ll be frustrated and pushing constantly uphill. Whilst the growth mindset is preached, it’s not the reality. The culture doesn’t support it, the reporting lines don’t support it and least of all, management doesn’t support it. 

- Middle management spin their wheels to justify their existence - lots of micromanaging, doing things for the sake of it rather than what is efficient or effective.
Advice to Management
- Take action when your employees provide feedback. Even if there are less than 5 people in the team, if there is a consistent trend in poor feedback on the manager, do something about it. 

- Put a face to HR and don’t outsource everything to third parties - it’s frustrating getting any support.

- People leave bad managers, not jobs. Look at who you hire or promote into management. Don’t move people into management positions simply because there is no one else available for the role. And don’t perpetuate that problem by refusing to deal with poor performing managers.

","Leadership in the organization I worked it has progressively gone downhill. No longer do they care about building a strong team, and only focus on metrics and producing deliverables with the least amount of manpower/head count. Local leadership will find every possible way to tell you how the team is not performing well, and will routinely spin metrics to hide the flaws and gaps in process and workflow. All the while touting transparency, and fairness. Yearly required training talks about these concepts, but locally they are not evangelized. If your output starts trending downward, they will literally push you out in front of the bus. Local top leadership is expecting blind loyalty and obedience, and will burn you out if you don't. The once great team, is now just a shell of it's past self and being decimated by poor senior leadership.

","The organization is a matrix with multiple stakeholders to manage, if you're an individualist more than a team player, not the place to be. Navigating it to get things done is complex, if you can't deal with internal complexity and sometimes chaos, not the place to be. If you are not comfortable with ambiguity and with change, neither a place to be.

- Plenty of opportunity to branch out and learn about other areas/get involved with other aspects of the store or company as a whole.

- Company listens to feedback and creates growth opportunities to other areas of the company

- VERY LGBTQ+ Friendly and accepting atmosphere

- Company actually cares about community involvement and encourages employees to take part.
","- Hourly rate could be better for Inventory related positions. They are paid the same as sales staff.

- Not a whole lot of room for growth unless you are in certain fields, or are willing to move to the United States

It is a true software company if software engineering is indeed your passion.
","Base pay and RSUs are lower than industry. Because of that the good people leave for better pay eventually. This causes not only churn, but also reduces the quality of the engineers eventually.

Satya did a good job on the image of the company, however when you are inside, many things are the same. Diversity and inclusion is a joke. Most upper mid-level management (some M2s, most directors, DEs, junior VPs) resist to change, so organizations, ICs, M1s get stuck in between.

","Let go while still providing huge business value so that they could get ""new blood"". Untrained, inexperienced newcomers are constantly hired to replace at a lower cost more senior (read OLDER) employees. It should be illegal they way Microsoft treats older, experienced, valuable employees.
Aside from that its always been a highly political, bloated mess of an organization based on old boys network connections and run like a club.
Good thing they have had cash to try and catch up in the cloud.

Eastside location in Puget Sound
","Extremely frequent re-orgs. Each team I have been on has been disbanded and scattered to the winds every 5 since I started 2 years ago. It's impossible to make progress in one's career when management is randomizing the leaf nodes of the org chart constantly.

Difficult internal mobility. Internal transfers are treated like external applicants. I applied for both internal and external jobs and got a senior software engineer offer from Google, while in parallel, I got rejected for an internal team because I messed up a LeetCode ""Hard"" interview problem in my internal interview rounds. 

At Microsoft, it's easier to leave the company than to switch teams.
Advice to Management
Move to a consistent interview bar so that internal transfers don't require a grueling job search. Internal hiring managers might consider looking at my internal performance history instead of treating me like a random external spammer.

Stop the constant re-orgs. I wouldn't be as concerned with the internal job search if I weren't having to do it constantly.

2019-08-05, Customer Success Manager,"Dublin, Dublin","Current Employee, more than 1 year","Disappointing, Despite the Frills","-Work-life balance. 
-Plenty of learning opportunities. 
-Relaxed environment. 
-Great facility. 
-Friendliness & respect rule.
-Good for short stays.
","-Improperly skilled, confused and, worst, biased Middle Management. Everything goes according to managers liking. This creates a toxic environment where competent & skilled employees who are not equally good brown-nosers aren’t given the merit they deserve simply because favoritism wins.

-Career development opportunities are minimal. Internal movements are totally political, the day a new job is posted (especially those non requiring specific technical skills), they already know who is going to be hired. All hiring arrangements happen before the vacancy is announced. 

-Cloud sales units are struggling (lack of ability to translate the company cloud into tangible business results, mainly due to the operations being off-shored which creates some sort of disconnection with the customers). 

-Invisible HR. 

-Organization transformation into being a cloud service provider is going on so the company seem to be experimenting new business models where most people feel uncomfortable & at stake. And they are. Teams happen to disband very often. So, it doesn’t seem to provide a safe & stable environment to establish a long term career plan as multinationals of the same size do.

-Very poor on-boarding experience, especially for people relocating from outside Ireland, no proper orientation around what to expect, where to go, how to understand the payroll and country tax scheme. On-boarding is purely focused on skills ramp up (which is not enough if you know you're bringing in expats). 

-The cultural transformation being led by Satya hasn’t found a place yet in the day-to-day business, the company is still very fragmented in the way business is done & objectives are sought after & when you're there for a while you sense a gap between his view of the company & the reality of things. So, much vision but no ability to execute.

","Given its size, experience is highly dependent on your personal team. There is also a slow pace to the organization from a decision making perspective (given the number of people involved in many decisions). Similar to most large companies, some mid level leaders who are less ambitious and “parked”, therefore can make for challenging dynamics on some teams.

Microsoft has given me the opportunity to “reinvent” myself multiple times as I have progressed in my career. The work is fast paced and there is often more to be done then you have time to accomplish is a normal work week, but the effort is rewarding. Microsoft has had it’s ups and downs over the years, but is as good a place to work now as it has ever been.

The local company culture is insane - at some point, you will be regularly working illegal amounts of overtime, working while sick, working over weekends or working at night and asking yourself why did you even come here. There is this ever-present tension, everything needs to be done yesterday and in the end, you're working on a product that sends spam. Multiple people ended up in a hospital due to this environment.

2019-07-10, Verification Engineer,,"Current Employee, less than 1 year",So far so good; early impressions of new job,"Industry leading compensation and benefits, good culture, very comfortable workplace environment. They will do whatever it takes to enable you what you need to do your job. Other tech companies it can be a nightmare to just get the basic things you need to do your job but here they go out of their way to make sure you have what you need and are comfortable. Honestly the office is so high end and all my stuff is so nice, I don't even want to go back to my crappy apartment at the end of the day.

The work life balance has been really great so far. I previously worked at a company that everyone claims is the best for work life balance and it wasn't. Lots of people say it is bad at MSFT but I haven't experienced having to work evenings and weekends yet but I'm still new (< 1 yr). So far my manager is fantastic - really invested in my success. I'm hoping it stays that way.
","I've heard horror stories from ex-employees and one does not need to go far to find them on the internet. None of that has been my experience so far. There are over a hundred thousand people working here so I don't doubt some teams / organizations could be more miserable. I also work at a satellite office where it is more laid back than on the main campuses.

The downsides I have experienced is it's easy to get out of the loop / disconnected from the other engineers on teams that aren't directly associated with your own team, but teams that you need to work closely with to get your job done efficiently. In other words: it's a big company and it's hard to organize multiple large teams spanning multiple time zones. 

I also am working on a relatively small piece of the puzzle. It seems many people run the risk of being silo'ed. They move people around periodically to prevent stagnation. This isn't really an issue to me because I will do whatever it takes to remain employed so the idea that one should have to always be engaged in the most important tasks etc. has always kind of felt like a giant sentiment of entitlement that most of my millennial cohort adopt so this is not really a con to me.

And who knows, they could fire me next month and revoke my starting bonus and I might be singing a different tune.

Building a culture where people are truly valued and not just a replaceable cog in the machine. Lots of opportunity and great things happening at this company. Compensation is good including great bonus and stock possibilities as well.
","Commutes are ridiculously long in Redmond, even with transportation options provided by the company. Most senior managers live close so maybe they don't feel the pain. I spend 2-3 hours per day on the company bus (but at least there is WIFI, so it isn't a complete loss). Some groups are ok with regular remote work, while others insist physical presence everyday. It would be nice to see more allowance for working remote 2-3 days a week to take commuters off the road. Traffic just gets worse every year.

","My analogy for Microsoft is that it's like a carnivorous tropical pitcher plant. You come in and the pay is great, work life balance etc. But, over time you start to stagnate and work becomes this 9-5 thing you're comfortable doing but not really excited about. I think that about sums up 90% of the people here. 

Also, depends on your team but they really just stick you somewhere out of college. No matching based on skills really. Moreover, your manager can be all over. Compared to a startup, you just won't learn or grow as much. A lot of people who are 'comfortable' are here and like just sitting around. Not really any sense of urgency. Good if you have family and aren't ambitious about work and such. Not good if you're out of college and trying to grow.

2019-07-04, Software Engineer,,"Current Employee, less than 1 year",Your success depends more on your team rather than your performance.,"- interesting projects with complex challenges (if you have the luck to end up in a cool team, if not you see it as a cons)
- smart people around you (you don't feel like the smartest man in the room :)))
- a lot of resources available for you to learn.
- senior people are willing to help you or are sharing at least from their knowledge of experience what's the best you can do in a particular situation.
- I ended up in a really new team and the product is written from scratch so I know almost the whole codebase and I know who to ping in case I have questions. Also we're using the latest tech stack so I am up-to-date :)
-
","- you don't have to choose your team. When you come to interview you will be picked by one interviewer, so if you wanted a team that it's not in the interview rounds, bad luck
- your manager can be your ""best friend"" or your ""worst enemy"". The bad part is you don't have to chose.
- promotions vary from team to team. You should switch teams if it's not a fair process.
- you thought you don't need to brush your algorithms? guess what, if you want to switch teams you will most likely re-interview (and all the times you want to switch your team, basically you start the process again, but you have your connects)
- pay is less than competition (Google and Facebook and many others still pay you more...)
- there's no free food. God I wish I had that! Besides saving money, an important factor for me would be saving TIME! I'd rather do something else when I arrive home than cooking dinner.
- in some teams you have work-life balance, but for me I feel that there's always something to do or I feel the pressure to ship as fast as I can.
Advice to Management
Please raise salaries and give free food to employees! 

Also consider a team-matching process before ending up in a team. If I am not a lucky person I would hate my day-to-day job only because I didn't chose my team before.
There's Google matching process, where you can talk with teams before accepting your offer. And there's also Facebook and Bloomberg with their bootcamp / training and after that a ""job fair"" where teams present what they are working on and you have the possibility to choose your top.

Also make the promotion process more transparent.

2019-07-01, Program Manager,Hyderābād,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",Cross function work culture in Microsoft,"Smart, bright people (who take the first flight out to greener pastures)
","Engineering teams are run by Principal Engineering Managers, who essentially do what they feel like with the product, with a complete disregard to processes , practises , roadmaps, backlogs , customer wants - basically any feedback that doesn't impact their appraisal. Agile is a joke, you are lucky if a developer so much as tests what they have coded. The randomest things get the highest priority, cuz it catches the whims and fancies of the EM. Any questioning the code quality might just result in a PR review request to the PM. Most EMs cannot hold their ground in front of aggressive engineers because this impacts their manager rating. This leaves product managers (lets call them that cuz that's what they are irrespective of the program title we slap on them) to take the blame for pretty much anything that is beyond what they can handle. Managers may be technically sound individual contributors but lack leadership ability (apart from the trait that makes you suck up and grow up the career ladder) . The rule of the thumb us convenience - if the ask is out of our comfort zone, let us pretend we got confused and did not understand it correctly. Or let just call it a new requirement. There is zero sense of ethics, of doing the right thing for the product or even for the customer. Inclusion, respect are words we write in our appraisals and put on our event hoardings for better PR. From the inside, we are as hollow as we can be. In my experience as a PM, this is the worst company I have worked for. There is zero support system for doing the right thing. Everything works on manipulation, coercion and how you can stay in the good books of engineering managers, irrespective of your function (even if you are an HR)
Advice to Management
Respect the functions that you have created. Give due value to how these different functions function. If you do not need them, don't pay lip service by giving them a job and then treating them with disrespect.

2019-06-17, Premier Field Engineer,,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",Good Company,"Services side of the house is pretty good if you carve out a niche for yourself at some good customers. Work-life balance is possible but can be tricky depending on customer location and whether the customer requires 100% onsite (e.g. many Federal customers). Benefits package is actually worthy of comparison when adding to total compensation. Rewards often match output, especially if you learn what your management/senior leadership are looking to quantify for the region or team's overall performance. 

Access to mentorship can be challenging in Services as opposed to the Engineering or Sales areas, but you have access to most of the company and if you put time into networking, it can definitely be done. Access to some of the best minds and best training in the world, but you need to set good boundaries to balance time spent billable vs training and keeping up. They factor in training time, but you have to schedule it at regular intervals and make sure your customer(s) is/are happy with timing
","Challenging for those who have a hard time self-promoting (have to balance between highlighting good/great performance while remaining humble. This is not a company for insanely bright solo performers who have no ability to share their knowledge - a high premium is placed on building upon the success of others (generally not starting from scratch) and promoting the success of others (e.g. build things in such a way that they meet best practices and can be reused in others' projects. In my mind, this aspect is a pro, not a con, but for those who want to go ""lone cowboy genius"" this is not the place for you unless you are really willing to stretch yourself.

While our software is great, our internal tools need work. Things like timekeeping and customer records are accurate but have quirks that make them tedious to use. While management is aggressively looking to replace these, it is slowly progressing. Not the biggest con if you come in expecting it, but it is a bit disappointing given the caliber of the company.

Finally, there are pockets of services where the customer contracts have been written with very little protection for the PFE or Consultant - you may be asked to do something ridiculously out of scope or unreasonable from a man-power/schedule perspective. While this is not generally the case, you will need to network your way through the situation (leverage peer assistance), while working with the Account team to adjust scope. Some contracts may be so bad that you need to quickly rotate out. However, there truly is plenty of opportunity to move around - you are not hired for a single slot like most other services companies.
Advice to Management
Fix tools, work on how your contracts are worded to increase customer satisfaction and protection of services employees.

Relaxed atmosphere in the office.

Pretty good campus. Convenient location and commute options.

Easy to switch teams, and lots of different projects to choose from.

Very open source friendly internally these days.

Can be very flexible on schedule and even remote work, depending on the subdivision. There's no corporate-wide anti-remote policy, like in some places, and no informal bias overall, but some teams are much more open to it than others. Ask, and you shall receive.

""Stability"" is the key word permeating everything. If you like that, this is the place to be. If you'd rather take significant risks for great rewards, probably best look elsewhere.
","Management higher up tends to chase their written commitments too much, beyond common sense.

Career advancement is generally slower than in other similar companies.

Less of an ecosystem bubble than it used to be, but still a bit of a bubble, especially in Windows. If you are in the wrong spot for too long, it's easy to end up being an expert with a skillset nobody really needs outside the company.

2019-06-13, Director,"Redmond, WA","Former Employee, more than 8 years",Sophisticated workplace exclusion,"Great benefits. CEO/Satya who cares about the work environment for his employees or at least is visible in vocalizing that. Human Resources less so - pretty standard, protect the status quo and current leaders mentality.
","I worked in Redmond in Windows/E&D. As a highly educated and senior leader who is a woman of color, I felt repeatedly excluded by the white women in my organization, particularly those with historical/seniority status. They had very subtle exclusionary behaviors that can’t be “written up.” Examples include: talking about me behind my back, which I heard from another colleague; discounting/ignoring my contributions and ideas; greeting only each other in the office and not initiating social conversations with me; seeding doubt about my project outcomes and timelines by telling the executives that we weren’t going to hit our timeline and budget. Meanwhile, my white female counterparts gave themselves generous overages on completing their pieces both in time and budget. 

In my history of working for multiple companies and work environments, I have never felt so invisible, devalued and disrespected than at Microsoft.
Advice to Management
Take employee complaints seriously, even if you hear them through the grapevine and not directly. Employees don’t feel comfortable going to HR which is seen as highly biased protector of the status quo. I get it, HR professionals move up the chain by protecting and advocating for the leadership.

Cons
Employees who even suggest that women are capable, especially when they have their job review, can expect their job to be threatened. Of course it's done verbally behind closed doors and for seemingly unrelated or non-specific reasons, but it's there. The politeness you see around the company is a thin veneer over the sheer toxicity this company's management has.

The company separates employees into three categories: college hires, industry hires, and internal transfers. Industry hires are people with experience outside of Microsoft since college. If you're of those then run! They'll treat you like crap. So many good engineers are pushed out of the company.

Judge the CEO by what lower management acts on. It's not a pretty picture. 

Here is an indication of how toxic the work environment is: if you have more than 5 years of Microsoft experience on your resume, the industry will treat you like ""damaged goods"". You may not be employable after that. I'm getting out while there's still hope for me.

Talk about DNI and ""open door policies"" are just lip service. Lower management is never required to act on it. They protect the status quo.

There is no reason to join MSFT if you are top of the line as a professional. But if you can't make it to the Google's, the Amazons, the Spotify's, the fun start ups with high growth potential, you can shine at MSFT, if the grayness of it all doesn't kill you or permanently damage you.
","The systems and processes at Microsoft have taken a life of their own. MSFT is a living example of how technology poorly applied does not empower people but actually hinders them to achieve their full potential. MSFT lacks common sense, lacks innovation. The leadership talks about diversity but its all straight white men which, worse of it all, have been at Microsoft FOR EVER, so they have no clue how to really apply culture change. They dont even know what an innovative culture looks like and that includes the poster boy, Satya, who is the most hierarchical, corporate of them all, despite his ""family"" story which has been totally overrated.

Pros
- great benefits
- RRSP matching
- up to 10 sick days per year
- decent pay for retail work
- quarterly bonuses based on store performance
Cons
- bullying store culture
- managers who take sides and don't actually resolve conflicts
- cliquey social groups and diversity as a buzzword
- a low ceiling for promotion and actual career opportunities
- rewards and recognition only go to the people the management like the most, barring any other criteria
- nowhere to go if you have a legitimate complaint about how you've been treated
Advice to Management
Stop pretending that things are fine just because 60% of your employees are relatively content. If you have an employee who started out great, motivated, innovative, hit and exceeded all their sales targets and was a favourite of customers, the fact that they left your store demotivated, ""lazy"", and disgruntled is not at all normal. (FWIW, my new job is so much better)

I find it rather disingenuous that Microsoft's internal (and external?) tagline is all about diversity, but in truth it's really a buzzword. I know I am different, but I was not disrespectful, I didn't ask for anything except respect, and I got disregarded and bullied to the point where I basically only stayed there to get a paycheque. I wanted out by the end of my first year there.

Flexible working conditions.
Salary is above average.
Culture is supportive, hard-working and fun among similar level colleagues.
The level of autonomy. (Managers can be trusting in your capabilities.)
","Overly focused on diversity to the point where it seems almost biased...
Some bad apple managers are still there. Self-serving and political beasts...
Oddly, jobs & promotions are based on who you know, rather than merit.
The level of autonomy. (Managers can sometimes be ghosts...rarely in office. In my case, I had a manager that feigned interest and cancelled last minute on weekly 1:1s. I think we met face to face 3 times in 6 months? Total talk time 1hr?)
Advice to Management
Review the staff engagement surveys thoroughly and take note of what is being said as much as what is not being said. Some employees are unable to give frank reviews even though the survey maybe anonymous, as it will be easy to determine where the feedback came from if they are in a small work team... Not all managers are the same in meetings with SLT, as they are with their direct reports... Maybe do not rely on surveys alone? Meet with your divisional employees 1:1 at least once during the year?

","No one cares... your boss, they better be strong and have backbone and conviction or you may experience an awful work environment. This isn’t similar to other companies, this is a constant within Microsoft. Let me give me context. Yes - MICROSOFT is obsessed with diversity but this also means that often the best qualified person didn’t get the job. I’ve watched this happen time and time again. When you interview or “loop” if there isn’t enough diversified candidates then MICROSOFT will redo the interview process - EVEN if a highly qualified candidate was available. 

Every year there’s a high probability you’ll end up in a reorg. In 5 years I was caught in 4 organizations. Unproductive and confusing to both employees and customers. MICROSOFT is not customer obsessed. Moving roles constantly makes it hard to know your customer well and add value. Every year my new customers made it a point to let me know how upset they were with the constant shifting. 

This is a company you go to out of college then leave! There’s little stability and unless you’re a minority (which I am, a woman) you’ll struggle with promotions even if you’re a rock star.

","As an intern, there is no previously planned training or exposure to best management practices, and given the size of the organisation, if you dont have previous experience it is easy to get lost and not know when to expect better.

Create more consistent performance reviews and arrange career development plans for interns that are consistent with the values of the organisation and with interns´long-term objectives.

2019-05-16, Customer Solutions Specialist,"Dublin, Dublin","Current Employee, more than 3 years",Inside Sales Dublin - TSP and SSP roles,"- vibrant atmosphere
- amazing products
- good future perspective for investors
- good work life balance
- amazing building
- general good ethos with customer care and data protections
","- pretty much no perspective of development into other parts of corporation
- movement out of Inside Sales is actively discouraged
- salaries that are only 2/3 of what industry standards are
- chances of moving up into manager roles almost zero
- promotions happen very rarely and are subject to personal likings of managers
- managers that have no clue how to motivate people
Advice to Management
If you do not want to keep losing your experienced and devoted people to the competitors start paying industry standards. It is ridiculous that Human resources have such high power on salaries and managers have almost no options to keep and/or promote high performers. Inside Sales still seems like a machine that scales largely and should attract only young singles without families, that are willing to change the employer anyway every 18 months. ""Customer obsession"" does not come with frequent contact changes.

Microsoft uses an internal build system that's atrocious. It's worse than msbuild, which they don't use. It breaks all the compelling features of Visual Studio (intellisense, etc). Build times are incredibly long and really slows down your work. It's 2019. This isn't acceptable.

Git practices and VSTS leave a lot to be desired.

Fragmented telemetry systems. Different teams use different components. So many different dashboards need to be written. Unfortunately, the PMs can't write code so you'll be doing that.

2.) No diversity. Don't let the rah rah talks fool you. This company doesn't care about promoting women or ethnicities, which is why there's been so many lawsuits. Luckily this company has lots and lots of lawyers to fend off all of these lawsuits.
3.) Incredible amount of layoffs. Every quarter there are layoffs, which have become a running joke among managers. Hundreds of people get laid off while the company continues to hire at rapid speed.

From day one she had it in for me, not sure why as my previous manager was supportive, open, gave great feedback and constructive feedback. A pleasure to work for. The new one was backstabbing, sarcastic, unsupportive and a downright bully. I was singled out and no matter what I did, it was wrong. Even though I hit revenue target of 159%, had amazing customer feedback and my colleagues all got on well with me. In the end I left because of her, she made me feel ill. It got to the point where I had physiological issues with the thought of going to the office. I would feel anxiety, not be able to sleep, just wondering what she would pick on with regards to my performance on that day. I left my manager, not my company. I'd been there over 10 years, until she came along. She mentioned my salary numerous times, so I suspect that I earned more than her and she didn't like it??

Easy going environment. Lots of free things offered to grow your knowledge base, such as free Microsoft vouchers and access to ebooks. I would return to Microsoft for a job but probably not at the datacenter.
","A technician is all hardware based, no skill in OS or Networking required and achieving a higher up position in these fields is nigh impossible as the administrators/junior engineers are outsourced to India. 
 
People that move up are typically those who are self-serving and lacking empathy. It's all about playing politics.

There currently isn't adequate staffing for a 24/7 site. If you want overtime you'll get it.
Advice to Management
Outsourcing admins & junior engineers needs to end to attract and keep talent. Great employees are leaving to advance their skills and pay. They need a ladder to climb not a cliff.

Reward education, certifications, and general hard work. 

Don't be afraid to throw the policy book out the window if an employee's well being is at stake. Reward empathy don't punish it.

Business Outlook
Pros
Great work, get to work on latest technologies. But that's about it.
Cons
0 work-life balance. Absolutely no adherence to processes. People working overnight and destroy the work environment get all benefits and recognition, people genuinely working with proper timings despite completing all the work, do not get any recognition or credits. Management also promotes only such employees. You only get appreciation when you screw up a project and then bring it back to a better stage. The management won't even know what project you're working on if you do everything perfectly and smoothly.
Advice to Management
Start noticing people who genuinely work hard and not only the ones who show off by sending emails late in the nights.

2019-04-16, Director of Sales,"San Francisco, CA","Former Employee, more than 10 years",My Experience at Microsoft,"Great internal programs to promote continued learning and honing of various skills. Great benefits to help their customers build up savings and avoid costly pitfalls.
","While Microsoft had supposedly abandoned the stack ranking system there are many aspects of it that still exist. The problem is that it is hard for Microsoft to maintain strong Individual Contributors because as they get promoted they get unfairly compared to Managers and their teams consolidated accomplishments. There is a tendency for Microsoft to clean out older employees (48+) without a strong basis.
Advice to Management
Given how much Microsoft invests in it's employees there should be more effort to create much more protected paths for those that are stellar Individual Contributors. This would not only protect Microsoft's large investment but allow it to continue tapping the value that comes from both the knowledge and maturity these individuals bring to the organization.

2019-04-16, Data Scientist II,"Cambridge, MA","Current Employee, more than 3 years",Great work atmosphere at Cambridge location,"Colleagues are very friendly and sharp, competent people: many are recent graduates of local colleges and graduate programs. There is a great work atmosphere cultivated by leadership that has been with this department since it was acquired from Nokia years ago. There are opportunities to make a name for yourself and expand your skill set with challenging projects, but also tolerance for us older folks who need to prioritize a work-life balance at some point in their career. (And perhaps for that reason, this group has a better gender ratio and more parents than most companies or other divisions of Microsoft.) Open to occasional remote work.
","Many colleagues who have been with the department a while are now at a senior level and have a hard time advancing further within the company. (There are only so many opportunities for management or high-level independent contributor positions, and even fewer are at the Boston office specifically.) It's a testament to the atmosphere of the team and the quality of the projects that these folks stick around. Not a problem if you are planning to come in at entry level and OK with potentially switching companies after a few years.

2019-04-12, Software Engineer,Prague,Current Employee,Not the best option if you have life outside the office,"- compensation and benefits;
- freedom to choose how you solve the problems;
- international team, interesting smart people around;
- sick days, home office;
- nice office with terrace;
- coffee, tea, fruits and some food for free;
- events for employees are organised quite often;
- there are some games, music room, maybe smth else but I don't know anyone who finds time to use it.
","- no work life balance if you want career movements: besides obligatory on-calls, you are informally asked to be available during some evenings/weekends.
- stress and pressure will accompany you (probably depends on a team).
- very competitive and people/teams blaming culture.
- bureaucracy and communication with HR/accountants.

To sum up, it can be a good place to start a career after the university, but not as perfect if you are a parent with kids and want to spend evenings/weekends with your family.

Advice to Management
If management is going to create some sort of environment that allows career development, learn to kill the barriers that are holding up the motivation. The suggestions to better your team's environment should be developed through the consensus of your employees. You only do your jobs when you have to unfortunately, but a majority of the time you can't lead by example yourself. Personal conflicts should be dealt almost immediately, and not after the fact that it has exploded into something uncontrollable. The lack of interdependence was certainly present, meaning you never checked on your employees' and how they were doing/what their progress looks like. The idea that there were goals for each employee falls off after the year mark. Remember to follow through with your words.

2019-03-20, Senior Director,"Redmond, WA","Former Employee, more than 10 years","Great culture shift under Nadella, but fast-swinging pendulum of inclusivity is leaving a wake","Great vision, strong potential, deep pockets, smart people, super benefits, discounts on MS software (not really on hardware), commitment to diversity + inclusion (but see ",", rapid promotions for diverse employees.
Cons
Work-life balance not good; at senior levels, tough to not be 'on duty' ALL the time. HIGH level of politics at CVP level, significant time spent managing this. MS is trying to 'solve' diversity & inclusion very aggressively, which is important but unfortunately means that some really great people who don't meet D+I criteria aren't recognized or rewarded at the level they should be (as in, rewards are moved down to free up money for diverse but less effective people), and non-diverse employees are shown the door QUICKLY to make room for … others. Hard to write that in a way that doesn't sound like a troll, which I'm not, but after years of observation, I don't see a better way to put that - there are no second chances for non-diverse people, so don't screw up.
Advice to Management
Stop trying to solve D+I by getting rid of very good but non-diverse employees, especially at senior levels. Diversity goals cascade down through management layers, creating competition among CVPs to be the 'fastest' to become the 'most diverse'. Neat idea, but limits opportunities for anyone who is not a diverse candidate.

*A lot of strong engineers and smart people work there...so, if you think you are the smartest person in the room - think again :)
*Interesting technical challenges.
","*Absolutely no carer prospects. People come to Microsoft to ""retire"" their career, not to boost it - and they think and act accordingly.
*The concept of ""ownership"" or ""responsibility"" is vague to the point of being non-existent - everybody are matrixed beyond proportion, everybody are just nuts n' bolts in the system. Everybody are entitled for an opinion and nobody's responsible for the result - democracy...
*People are busy with turf wars and politics, starting on senior levels and as far up as the eye can see (at least on PM side). 
*The amount of energy one has to invest to achieve a result - is vast and completely disproportional to that result. PMs are entangled in working their way through endless policies, stakeholders, organizational and operational constraints, etc. But dinosaurs that work there consider it normal because they don't have anything to compare it with. 
*Result oriented, active, critical minded professionals who want to make the products better - are either silenced in some niche or kicked out.
Advice to Management
Break the company into multiple autonomous small companies that have the freedom to compete, live or die. Become a shareholding-like organization that manages MONEY not content, scope and quality - because you are INCAPABLE of managing the latter. Microsoft is still very much a bulky monster, and bulky monsters will find themselves in a museum sooner or later.
The only reason you are still alive - is because Office and SQL are still the standards for many industries worldwide. Invest in standard making. Invest in customization tools/extensibility. Your ecosystem is falling apart because you moved to cloud (which is good) and left them all behind (which is bad).

Advice to Management
Carefully examine managers with long tenure - it will be very hard to detect toxic behaviour on the surface as individuals won’t speak up due to fear of retaliation.

Advice to Management
Promote team collaboration. Speak up to upper management if you don't agree with what you are being asked to do. There is huge disconnect between the message Satya Nadella is trying to convey and what is actually going on in the trenches. Help support closing the gap between the old Microsoft culture and new.

","- Terrible on boarding program... I came into the business from outside of IT being told I would be trained up well. Then arrived to be told it’s “a sink or swim” environment & I need to figure it out for myself through Microsoft’s online platform & from colleagues. 6 months later told by my manager that no amount of training can replace experience - totally farsical & discheveled company (in the UK anyway). 
- Poor salary compared to other tech companies.

Create a proper onboarding program.
Don’t preach about bringing in diversity, if you then struggle to make it work for someone who’s worked outside of IT. Otherwise all you will get in the future is ex IBM, HP etc.. the same people with the same experience & with poor industry knowledge.

2019-02-28, Premier Field Engineer,,"Current Employee, more than 1 year",Great...for the right people,"Benefits are excellent. Pretty much unlimited access to training and technology exposure...
","As a PFE, you will be required to maintain utilization minimums, the same as a consultant would be. Stay billable or you lose. This creates false urgency and stress, as well as terrible work/life balance. 

Microsoft doesn't tell you in the interviews, but they want you to be a workshop trainer...providing actual support or ""fixing things"" is an afterthought and frowned upon, as that's not where the money is. MS should change the job title to ""Technical Trainer"" and get over with it.
Advice to Management
Adopt true management techniques rather than holding on to old, out of date utilization requirements. There is constant internal and external advertisement of how amazing the work/life balance is. I'm wondering where that is or what positions outside of management that receive that. If you're required to work 60+ hours per week, not counting travel, where would balance be possible?

2019-02-25, Inside Sales,"Dublin, Dublin","Former Employee, more than 1 year","Horrible culture, terrible management and actual lies","Large range of products and roles, new building, decent food, decent health insurance
","Firstly it's important to note that the bonuses promised at interview are in no way secure. In fact there isn't money in the pot for everyone! Some will get paid, others will leave empty handed - that's the comanies methodology! Allocation of such funds is at management's discretion and not based on anything objective. German management in particular is deranged and will allocate bonuses according to who they like personally. They won't tell you this at interview. You might have to wait up to 18 month to find out if you'll receive anything, so it's a tough gamble.

Apart from that the company doesn't even try to limit the elbow mentality, that's the way inside sales at Microsoft works, and it again mainly comes down to who you suck up to determine who comes out on top. Atmosphere at work is accordingly. Sounds unbelievable? It is, and yet it is so.

Management in the German market was hired for this purpose early on in the establishment of inside sales, which tells you what kind of people they are. They don't seem to ""manage"" much else, i.e. Processes aren't working, advice and support is rare. It seems to be a bit better in other markets, but not by much. 

I've been at a number of IT companies in Dublin over the years, and this one is definitely the worst in everything. Think carefully before accepting a job here!

","As priorities changed, I found myself working on very different work than I was hired for, which I didn't enjoy as much and couldn't perform as well in. It was frustrating because I felt there was still valuable work in my area of expertise, but it was being almost eliminated from the list of priorities. There wasn't much to assist in a transition to a new role; only pressure to adapt to the change.
Advice to Management
I think having more help to transition into better positions as products change could be very valuable in keeping people working in their best areas, rather than enforcing flexibility. Specialized experience can bring a lot of value, and losing that entirely because a specific team no longer needs it is unfortunate.

2019-02-24, Software Development Engineer II,"Redmond, WA","Former Employee, more than 5 years",Excellent employer on the whole,"If you are fresh out of college, this is one of the best companies to work for. Like many other tech companies, there's a big emphasis on work-life balance and community building. In a lot of ways, it will feel like an extension of college in terms of the learning and events with other young professionals. Senior developers are, for the most part, very happy to mentor younger people and instill a sense of discipline. Internal mobility is fantastic as well, moving from team to team is relatively frictionless and it's Microsoft, so there's a team for almost any area you want to work in. There are so many resources that there's an expert for basically anything you want to know. There's tons of young professionals around too and Seattle is a great place to live. Pay is competitive with the other top companies at a junior level.

Exit opportunities are great here as well. If you pay attention and put effort into your work, you will come out with a brand name that recruiters all over want to see, as well as a disciplined, rigorous skill set to match.
","As you move up in ranks, the pay disparity between Microsoft and its competitors (Google, Amazon, Facebook) starts to grow, with Microsoft developers making substantially less than their counterparts. For some, this is okay if they value lifestyle more than career progression. For others, it's common to jump ship to another company.

As with any other big company, there's layers and layers of bureaucracy. For most mature teams, all work will be carefully planned months in advance, specced, discussed in multiple team meetings, with dedicated PMs and testers. In the beginning this is good because it teaches the absolute best, gold standard way to develop large software. After a while, it can become very dull and repetitive though.

The annual review system, which invariably involves peer feedback and encourages backstabbing peers, can be maddening. Even after spending several years here, most people will find it's hard to break off of the railroaded promotion system and really shine as a superstar, just due to the seniority-based culture and siloed nature of the work (you don't have the expertise to move into a management role or more technical area that's already being done by someone more senior, but by never doing that role you'll never build expertise).

Also your experience is hugely, hugely team dependent. Local team culture matters way more than anything that happens at top management level. Two employees at two different teams can have drastically different lives. Maybe the things I list as pros are actually cons in your team, and vice versa. Unfortunately there's no real way to tell what it'll be like working on a team until you actually start working there. You can gauge the number of young vs old developers to get a sense of the culture though.

Despite this Microsoft is still a fantastic company, no regrets after having worked here for 6 years. The opportunity to work alongside world-class engineers to ship code that all modern versions of Windows use has been a privilege.

Tasty subsidized food at almost every cafe on campus
Excellent for employees with children ( most managers are super flexible on work schedule) 
Incredibly intelligent business leaders-(specifically within engineering)
","I don't even know where to begin. As a seasoned HR professional, I am appalled at the bait and switch strategy that was used to get me to join Microsoft. I have over 7 years of strategic HR Management experience within the tech space and left an amazing company/team/boss to make one of the worst decisions of my life.

I was told coming in that I would supposedly be doing ""big"" things, but I quickly realized that I was just another cog in a big wheel. I spent the majority of my time (90 percent) writing emails to people about what I might do to get buy-in and permission rather than spending time actually executing. 

Overall, the organization is filled with gossipy, rest and vest types. I also witnessed a very bright young African American female employee verbally abused and viciously bullied by her manager while senior leaders turned a blind eye. For all of you out there, I would think long and hard before joining the HR function at Microsoft. Don’t say that you weren’t warned.

","Company is political. Satya Nadella is a CEO that cares for himself and that is well known. He looks down at people that are not as smart as he is. He claims he is average person to people and dresses down for the new Microsoft look. The company has to hire women as they have to show that they are not discriminating. This is not a new trend but now a unwritten one where Women are given the promotion in order to show the world they do not discriminate. The company is political and only cares for the top executives who pass out favors to those that are buddies. They are fortunate not to be audited by the US government again for antitrust.
Advice to Management
Be honest to potential hires. That men are not going to be selected over women as there is a deficit of women at the company. The company substituted one type of stack ranking for another. They dont make it public but they continue to do same bad behavior for years and until they get caught they won't change.

Advice to Management
Australians ""are apparently not the US"" which is garbage. Management spend too much time trying to do it their own way rather than take the learnings from other subs. There's a reason that it's behind Europe and the US.

Start promoting on skillset, not on tenure. It's no longer just a sales world. Compared to Europe or US, it's the old Microsoft. The cultural change being driven by the top is actively avoided down under.

However, the new vision/direction and improvements are not consistent in all divisions/functions.
","Certain businesses like Cloud + Enterprise and business functions like Marketing are highly dysfunctional. Middle management does not align to the company values the top leaders are driving.

People are generally collegial and collaborative (with some exceptions). The stock has been great if you've been around for a few years and could enjoy the runup in 2017-2018.
","Salaries are just OK, not great. Comp plans for pre-sales technical staff not competitive with the market, which leads to gamesmanship like giving people who should be on Account Technology Specialist roles in Account Team Units (ATU) in Solutions Specialist (SSP) roles so they can make more money--that is a problem in my org and leads to dissension among technical specialists in the STU, who don't have the opportunity to be on Solution Specialist comp plans while not being accountable for opportunity ownership. Local leadership doesn't understand the problem that causes for morale and the sense that ATUs are ""more equal than others"", to quote Animal Farm. 

Quotas are assigned to accounts instead individuals, so every seller shares a quota with someone else, sometimes many others. That can lead to internal friction and some free-riding.
Advice to Management
Clearly, Satya has done a masterful job of getting MS back on track by pursuing a very Buddhist-inspired cultural transformation (not fighting ""what is so"" and being authentic and humble). Satya isn't explicit about the Buddhist origins of his leadership, but those who know his background and family history can infer the influences. Satya has done a good job of selecting solid leaders at senior levels, but there is more work to do with mid-level managers (national subsidiary leadership and a few levels down; especially the legacy people who thrived under Kevin Turner). Cultural change is happening and my advice to Satya is to focus on culture forever. He's off to a great start, but it could all revert with some bad hires and taking his eye off the ball on culture in the sales org.

2019-01-25, Inside Sales Account Manager,"Dublin, Dublin","Current Employee, less than 1 year",Like being in a bad movie,"Seriously don't know what to write here
","Really strange/bad atmosphere, extreme competition amongst employees in the same team (not the good kind, the kind where you'd rather not come to work in the morning; seems like a deliberate management methodology), people generally superficial, self-centered and arrogant, I think they deliberately hire malignant narcissists into directorate and higher management positions to keep up that toxic culture (seems to be working in one way or another).

Been here for a few weeks only and already looking for something else. No way to stay here.

It has enabled to reinforce my technical skills around recruitment and my soft skills around nurturing my partnerships with my key stakeholders. It has given me the opportunity to grow as an individual, to challenge myself, to increase my self awareness, to feed my insatiable desire for learning - especially for learning from my mistakes.
","Sometimes too much process-oriented which unfortunately has a not very positive impact on the candidate's experience.

","The reality is that nobody in the company cares about ideals, morality, trust, or collaboration. It is and has always been a micro world of power struggles. If you do not have power, you will be raped, figuratively and literally. The company keeps questionable people at leadership positions. HR will not help file-rank employees, their main mission is to protect the business unit kingdoms. Be warned, the culture empowers people in power to rape, HR will protect them, what they preach is all smoke and mirrors. So long the company has money and makes more, anything is tolerated and covered up.

2019-01-18, Datacenter Technician,"Ashburn, VA","Current Employee, more than 1 year",It's OK (Datacenter),"These are the Pros for Microsoft Datacenter:

- Easy Job
- Pays more than IBM
- Stress free in terms of physical labor
- Microsoft offers amazing benefits. My current benefit payout is 19.1k. 
- Microsoft pays you back for fitness related items
- Workplace environment is relaxed
- Great starter job in the IT industry, I would recommend this job to people just starting out.
","These are the Cons for Microsoft Datacenter:

- Does not pay nearly as much as Amazon or Oracle 
- Job might be easy, but it's very linear. You will definitely need something to distract you from the boredom.
- Gossip and backstabbing is like wildfire in this particular location of Microsoft.
- Does not offer any holidays off at all, unless requested. And only 3 people per shift can get them off. Everyone else is stuck here on holidays. (upside you get double pay if working on holidays).
- People get hired here with subpar knowledge on how to do the work, which has caused a high turnover rate of talent. 
- Very little to almost no career opportunities in terms of promotions. Most people have to move out, in order to move up. This also sorta ties into the talent having a higher turnover rate.
- Yearly pay raise is extremely low.
Advice to Management
This is the Advice to Management for Microsoft Datacenter:

- More interpersonal skills with the employees. We would rather want to see you as someone who's actually out there working with the employees, or at least trying to relate to us, rather than sitting in an office all day behind closed doors doing email work. We run a data center, not an office building. We ALL should know how to do the work, not just the few of us. 
- Please hire more talent, and less fillers. Perhaps consider replacing some deadwood to alleviate the discrepancy.
