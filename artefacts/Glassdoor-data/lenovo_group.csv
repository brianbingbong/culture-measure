","I guess an earlier review sort of summed up some of my thoughts, which said, ""Lenovo has middle-aged men and women trying to sell to millennials."" But having seen both the commercial and consumer business, I think there is a lot more to it. - Marketing team in Lenovo is a combination of islands - WW-Brand-Consumer-Rel-SMB-Social-Digital-Events/Regions/Countries. They are all disintegrated and work in silos. Each has their own agenda and brownie points to earn. - Middle & senior managers who have no clue how to do marketing. Lack of subject matter expertise clearly shows, and they don't bother to attend any trainings irrespective of their knowledge. - Bureaucratic to a large extent, it will take you months & years to get things done. There are so many so-called strategic ongoing projects to fix issues that you lose count. - Zero accountability (work neither impacts the top-line nor bottom line). This affects your ability to function after some time as an employee. - Appraisals are purely based on what your managers think about you. Work-life balance is questionable. Personal biases & favoritism is clearly evident. - Ultimately, you end up doing stakeholder management to keep your boss and other teams happy. - Zero transparency (you are ultimately treated as a foot soldier)

","- Sales team is way overpowered, basically, they have too high of the delegations and exceptional approvals are always granted to close deals, at the cost of the company's best interest. - Headcount of the team is very tight, hence people tend to be overworked (like 5 men working on a 10-man job)

","Several points: 1- The onboarding process is a mess. I was waiting for about a month to get access to everything. That is very bad since I had to go there every day and do nothing while having a meeting every morning about what we did the last day! 2- The unlimited pay timed off is just a joke. Every time you need to do something your supervisor needs to know details which I found not very different from anywhere else and not a positive point. 3- Politics is more important than knowledge, if you know who to be friends with, you are set! 4- Teams are separated in different cities of different countries. Which means 24/7 notifications and virtual meetings. It is very difficult to have product related discussions on the phone, especially if your native language is not English. 5- manager and senior-level are not always the people with experience and knowledge that you might think. I have seen more than one instance that the person in charge of the project did not even understand fully what the project and its limitations were! 6-No documentation exists of simple things that people did or tried. Neither anything for environment setup. Makes everything take forever and gives you lots of anxiety to accomplish something. 7- It is not very nice in my view to tell people we had a great quarter and everything is good as we were on top of the Covid and moved production to other locations, just to get your layoff letter next week! what kind of policy is that?! 8-I have read this in the comments and thought maybe that was just some people's experience and I will be different. So, I am mentioning this point knowing that if you get an offer, there is a good chance you will accept. However, you have to understand that if you see 50+ people in the orientation (taking place twice per month) it means they layoff with some similar numbers too. Trust me they are not expanding like that during Covid.

2020-03-16, Software Engineer,"Morrisville, NC","Former Employee, more than 10 years","If you know the right people, work on a good team, and have a good manager, this is a great place to work","The benefits (medical, dental, , vision, and 401k) are good and Lenovo has a good number of paid holidays. Your insurance premiums are much lower than some of the contractors who have to go through their contracting company. There's a gym, nurse, and cafeteria on the campus (contractors are not allowed to use the gym nor the nurse). The company usually offers free flu shots for the employees. On many teams, employees are assigned a Lenovo ThinkPad to use. The profit sharing bonuses are nice. Some of the contests, benefits, spiffs, and gifts in the sales teams are great (one year lease on cars and Rolex watches were given out in the past). They have an employee purchase discount on both the Lenovo PCs and Moto phones. They have many community events such as assisting Habitat for Humanity, etc... Ten years ago, they used to have free lunches to celebrate Thanksgiving and Christmas. Technically you have unlimited vacation (with manager approval). *****If you know the right people, work on a good team, and have a good manager, this is a great place to work.*****
","Some of the cons have been inherited from IBM - these include some inefficient structure and some software in some areas (Lenovo is making some attempts to change this). As mentioned before, there's a lot of corporate politics in some groups and I feel that some of this came over from IBM (at least my retired IBM friends confirm this). Some of the managers seem to fall into the category of ""they were great at what they did in their previous position, but they are not great at managing people"". Not always an issue, but some teams have to work closely with their counterparts in China and this could mean working later or earlier, due to the time differences. There seems to be a high turnover in some teams and there is seems to be a corporate wide layoff every two years. Contractors don't always have access to all of the perks the employees do.

","Lenovo's PC business has smart, hard working people, but they are hamstrung by incompetent leadership. Nowhere is this more true than in the workstation business. One such leader in a sales conference asked his audience if they would ""grow old with him"". Clearly he does not understand sales people want to get rich not old. One reportedly has anger management issues, and once threw a whiteboard marker at an employee for which he was demoted. This person continues to use his bully pulpit to threaten, force out or demote people who stand up to him. To make up for his shortcomings Lenovo management rushed in a former top HP guy who was booted off his job there within a year. He seems to be poaching from HP as revenge on his former employer. The chosen few still run the place hogging resources because the leadership is powerless to stop them. Most of Lenovo's growth comes from cheap ""workstation branded"" desktops sold into the channel. There were reported attempts to fake market share by reporting these desktop computers as workstations. Competitors caught them in the act, complained to IDC and Lenovo's share was knocked down. Dell, HP if you're listening, here's another Chinese company competing on price and about to flame out. There is only one way to go for a business like this... down. Look after your customers!

","Internal disputes between different areas of the organization lead to suboptimal performance. Regional executives fighting for more power and climbing in the leadership ranks drive unrealistic targets that are not sustainable leading to operational failures. This results in regular changes in local leadership for not achieving the results in a consistent basis. One evidence of this is that during 14 years of operation in Brazil, the company already had a total of 8 different Brazil general managers !!! Humans resources is very poor and limited. There are no strategic plans to develop a winning culture.

I accepted their relocation and sponsorship offered to move from my home country to the US where I wanted to work and live long term anyway. I sold most everything I had and shipped the rest to my new place in the US. Once in the US, Lenovo started the process of naturalization through the immigration process. Very thankful for this opportunity, but things took a turn for the worse. Six months into my new work life in the US, Lenovo had ANOTHER mass round of layoffs impacting myself but the rest of my team. Lenovo dropped the immigration process and sponsorship and now that I was only on an L1 VISA no other company could sponsor me and I had 2 months to return to my home country with no assistance from Lenovo. They turned their back on me and many of my other co-workers in the same situation giving us no options to stay in the US.

I read a book once and it described combat as mundane periods of really not doing much punctuated bye moments of sheer terror and when they're over a bunch of your friends are gone. That's pretty much this place in a nutshell due to all the layoffs, of which I made it through seven of them. Despite having to constantly lay people off you'd think at some point they would rethink how they do business but they never learn and they just keep making the same mistakes over and over and over. I worked for Motorola at first and when Lenovo took over it got worse. the products turn to garbage the treatment of the employees got worse, layoffs ramped up. most of the people I know that are still there are just biding their time waiting for their severance packages and not working real hard at anything and I think that definitely shows in their latest products.

Cons
There are no historical purchases from the accounts because 90% are all acquisition accounts. There is no strong evidence/guideline in how the management derived the quota for you. One quarter you can carry USD1.3 million, next quarter your quota can be 50% extra with the same acquisition accounts you carry the last few quarters. Any experienced salespeople know this is a suicidal move. You can easily overwork here, and you will never achieve your quota. Many people have come and go in a short period of time. Management will tell you, this job will eat up your personal time. If you are a person who values work-life balance, this company is not for you. If you are willing to burn yourself out for the sake of little money, this is the company for you. Management will harass you via WhatsApp you during the weekend/public holiday/annual leave for work-related stuff. Many people who are looped into the WhatsApp group have given up in replying. Many times people just ignore those message because over time it has become too overwhelmed to handle. Salespeople are battling with building pipeline, but the management just throws questions on how much you can bring in every week without contributing help or suggesting new ideas to improve/or make things work. If you try to voice out your opinion/suggestions, you will be easily shut down. Because all they really care about is numbers. They won't open up their mind to accept changes or suggestions. That is why the process here is NON EXISTENCE. Honestly, many people who came in the first week, they instantly know that this company has no process. If you try to tell your manager to improve a certain process, it's almost impossible. They will admit to you this company has no process. It's a dead end. It's no wonder this company never succeed. Because they are still so backward in their tools, process, and mentality. The company does not have a proper backend team to support you. If you are salesperson, be prepared to do everything yourself. After a while, you will start to question yourself. Is this little salary worth the job you are doing here? That's why so many people came in and left in a short time/see no long term future in Lenovo. Don't be the next one. Be smarter than us who experienced this and have left for a better company.

They are and are quite savvy bureaucrats that know how to protect their fiefdoms. Make no mistake moving up is about be selfish but being perceived as a collaborator.

","- In DCG, there has been a trend of moving much of the software engineering / development overseas and laying off employees in the US to reduce costs. - At the Morrisville site, the office is being converted into an open workspace which they touted as being a good thing just because it is ""new"", ""modern"", and will ""attract new talent"". But in reality, this is being done, so that they can cram more people into each building - once again, a cost reduction measure.

2018-10-22,Anonymous,,Current Employee,A company with high aspirations undergoing continual transformation,"The company direction is made very clear at a Board/SVP level. Customer centricity is a major watchword, and with it's program of transformation, growth has been seen across both Lenovo's core business of PC, along with the acquisitions of the x86 business from IBM and Motorola's Moto Brand. Lenovo is not scared of betting big, and it puts considerable money and efforts into both its R&D effort with solution partners and its Marketing function. The result has helped re-shape hearts and minds, accessing previously closed markets and customers, double-digit revenue growth in areas such as the Datacenter Group, dominance of the PC market, and a revitalised Motorola Business Group. Salaries are middle-of-the-road, and benefits include a reasonable bonus, pension, holidays, and a range of flexible contributary and non-contributary benefits.
","After working for Lenovo for a number of years it still feels like one is operating in a permanent start-up mode. Some business approaches can appear sound and logical at a strategic level, however the execution of these strategies at a lower strata is often poorly thought through, inefficient, and amateur in both implementation and consideration for both staff and customers. There is the impression of double standards. On one hand there are clear statements to the market that Lenovo continues to invest in its strategic businesses, whilst on the shop floor the message is one of short-termism, and repeated resource actions which frequently cut too deep, leaving remaining employees over-worked, insecure, and demoralised.

2018-10-14, Software Engineer,"Morrisville, NC","Former Employee, more than 8 years",Utter Rubbish,"Salary is good to start, benefits are good
","Job growth is non-existent. Lenovo almost always hires externally to fulfill its needs. The obsession with directional change mentioned by many other reviewers here is true, and when that occurs, many of these new hires find themselves responsible for a position not even close to what they were hired on for just a year or even six months prior. This definite is a sign of a company that does not have an actionable nor sustainable long-term vision. Of course, this is what senior management is responsible for and has failed to deliver on much of the time since the acquisition from IBM in 2005. Senior management is obsessed with changing direction as a response to failing to meet goals that were unrealistic to begin with. During my tenure at Lenovo, I saw a culture of 'yes men' as opposed to any real leadership. I say 'yes-men', because the vast majority of ""leaders"" are male. While there are some females in management, the majority of them are in lower-to-middle management. Lenovo's culture is also quite toxic. Bullying, negative gossip, and ostracization is frequent. This is actually encouraged by management with what they term ""visibility."" Indeed, it is more important to be seen and heard by the right people than actually do an excellent job and help your team or division succeed. If you can argue your way out of a poor job performance or blame someone else convincingly, it is believed. Many have learned to game this culture and work their way up the ladder. Some are moderately competent in their roles, whilst many lack even the fundamental skills necessary to succeed. The way around this is to either: 1) Pull rank and say ""I know better because I'm a higher band"" and then ultimately blame the impending failure on something else, or 2) use your internal connections to find a way around the person who is in a lower band to push your agenda forward and explain it in such a way that people in senior management (who have no clue as to what's going on besides how much money is being made and spent) to agree with you and take your side. I have seen many well designed plans thrown out the window in favor of ludicrously complex designs because of political posturing and power-plays. This, of course, makes it significantly harder for the people actually doing the work to successfully complete the requirements, so the answer to that is to have them work 12 hour days and weekends for weeks or months at a time. A VP I used to work for heard about how hard our team was working for months on end and his response to this was ""I don't care, as long as it gets done."" If you complain about being worked to death, you WILL be made fun of publicly by someone who out-ranks you and finds this type of humor acceptable. This workload isn't an exception to the rule, this is how it is 70% of the time at Lenovo. Layoffs occur multiple times a year and have for many years now. Management leverages globalization as an argument to tell you that you don't deserve job growth, a shot at a promotion, or to be paid better despite those of us that pushed through the hard times, make our respective teams succeed and have a significantly larger workload than many people at higher bands have. Several people in my role or similar have been told that management can get two engineers from China or India for the same amount of money we are being paid at Lenovo. While there is some truth to this, I would ask how this is a motivating factor to get me to work even harder at a company that puts more and more responsibility on its current workers and gives a 3% raise for the lucky ones, while external hires have more visibility, less responsibility, and generally a 10%-20% larger paycheck. Sadly, Lenovo is not one team. It is many internal divisions competing against one another for funding, indeed, survival. Divisions use one another to meet quotas, get ahead, or finish a product, then have to convince upper management how much they did themselves. The ironic thing is, many of these divisions are so interdependent so by trying to make one another look bad, this form of ""leadership"" is only really hurting the company as a whole. The only other companies I have seen use this model is organised crime. Lenovo also uses a bell-curve rating to force their employees into categories of 1, 2, or 3; 1 being excellent and rare to achieve; 2 being the norm for many hard working, competent people (2+ being higher on the 2 scale, 2- being lower, but not quite 3), and 3 for people who aren't doing their job, or more to the point, people that management does not like. Since bonuses are a large percentage of employees' salary, we are forced to compete against one another for the '2' positions. The '1' ratings are reserved for people with more visibility and who are favored, generally quite subjectively, by management. As an added bonus, this is a zero-sum rating system. For every 1, there must be a 3, for every 2+, there must be a 2-. This, again, forces people to work together in the short term, but then people that want to make a career here will not think twice about stabbing their co-workers in the back to get ahead.

As, an engineer, I want to work hard and want to contribute to the company, but I feel like I am held back by the politics and the lack of an engineering culture. The work that has been done by the existing team, is of very poor quality. This is further validated, as the manager of my team appears to prioritize Cheap and Fast, over Good.

","Its best days are behind it now. Clearly the company has lost its way and is now struggling financially. Lenovo used to be known for its bold but smart moves ( e.g. acquisition of IBM's PC division ) but now the management is better known for being self-absorbed and making strategically unwise decisions. The decisions to acquire both IBM's X-series server business and Motorola Mobility in the same year put too much of financial burden as well as organizational burden - neither of these have been successfully integrated at this time. Frequent org changes and strategic flip-flops point to lack of coherent management, make it an unstable work environment. The underlying businesses of Lenovo - IT and consumer hardware - are all in long term decline or consolidation. The company has not innovated in terms of new products (last successful one was Yoga laptops) or technologies. The management team (called the LEC) now feels like a bunch of old people who are increasingly out of touch with both customers and employees, tolerate no negative criticism, are out of ideas and clearly don't seem to understand that they also are running out of time.

","Lenovo is a traditional chinese company in every sense; copy what everyone else is doing, just do it cheaper. Don't let the marketing fool you, there's no thought leadership nor any research and development. Internal systems and processes are shunned in favour of hiring additional Chinese resources without the required skills. This translates to a slow moving bureaucracy like no other. If you're ok with that, whether or not you should accept an offer depends on which division it's in. In the personal systems, there's a good chance you'll have a good run. It's an established market and Lenovo's device range is pretty good. If it's in the Data Center division however, run for your life. On top of the aforementioned issues, you'll be bogged down by chronic lack of resources, immature and inexperienced management combined with unreachable goals. Do your due diligence and take notice how the average tenure is below 2 years, there's a reason for that.

2018-05-13, Channel Account Manager,"Raleigh, NC","Former Employee, more than 3 years",A $35 billion startup.,"The review title refers to a phrase I used to hear from time to time at Lenovo, used to describe the experience of working there. There is a lot of energy at Lenovo and a focus on the future. It's a young company and makes big moves. It moves quickly In this sense, it's like a startup. It's also a large, international company. This can obviously help the more nimble startup culture by providing capital and infrastructure, but it hindered Lenovo sometimes too, via bureaucracy and commitments to legacy systems. Lenovo's employees are warm and helpful. They are smart and most care about the company in a real way. I worked with many professionals whom I respect and that is one of the best parts of working there. In sales, one had considerable leeway to run things in one's territory as one saw fit. Management was open to new ideas and I implemented some of my own. Some failed, some succeeded; the openness to new ideas is a testament to Lenovo's culture. I am grateful to Lenovo and for the time I worked there. My experience there is defined by the fact that I didn't have extensive work history at the time of my hire; and working at Lenovo was my first experience working for a large corporation. Lenovo hired me soon after I graduated college and was open to taking a chance, which I'll never forget. I adapted well to the life of working at a large company. If you've worked at other companies and/or are coming in with a long resume, your mileage may vary. Lenovo is a great place to work that does have challenges; I would work there again if the right opportunity came along.
","I did work through a contracting agency before being hired on full time. I was paid well and treated well. There was tension among people who got hired from the contractors' pool and as a contractor you weren't eligible to certain things like sales contests. I was treated as a member of the team and valued. There were just some annoying limits of being a contractor. Lenovo consistently paid a little bit less across most jobs where I learned the salary against the industry. Pay can be a touchy subject for management but the fact is that not only was I miffed about my own pay towards the end of my stint; but competent, creative and innovative coworkers consistently left to take higher-paying jobs elsewhere. Speaking strictly regarding my time there there were manufacturing delays that put our shipping times well behind industry average. This was around the IBM x86 acquisition and year after it. It went on a long time. Global technology supply chains are incredibly complex. However, I think that considering that we faced serious problems for well over a year to the point that large sales were canceled and returned combined with the fact that Lenovo had many people whose expertise was global supply chains working on supply chains they themselves built, I think it's appropriate to criticize poor performance here. This was a political issue in my time. I have only my own observation that it was ongoing for a very long time and rumors I heard that certain senior managers were intransigent to change. Some had to be forged out to fix the problem, but this took a long time. I hope this has changed.

","Where to start.... Extremely low compensation compared to the rest of the industry. Unrealistic goals and expectations. Resources are very scarce. Can't keep employees. Layoffs or ""reorganizations"" happen frequently, and seem to have no rhyme or reason. I've seen successful inside reps get laid off before lazy, unsuccessful reps. Constantly ""growing"" and downsizing. Creating jobs and then cutting those same jobs. Very immature company as a whole for how long they have been around. You start as a contractor with an even lower salary + capped commission. Management is hit or miss. Some managers are very selective and play favorites. Individuals who are lazy, unproductive, and unresponsive can often be converted to a full time employee before others simply by brown nosing (barely metrics based at all). Don't get me wrong here - there are some great employees/reps/managers, but they often go unrecognized. Once you become full time, you get an extremely modest ""pay bump"" to your salary (still far below the industry standard for the same role). They say you now have an ""uncapped"" commission structure, which isn't true. If you are on track to overachieving, management has the ability (and will often do so), provide quota relief to individuals underachieving and tack that on to the ones overachieving to make things ""fair"". This, in turn, penalizesthose employees who are actually doing well. The LASR program is a good concept on paper, but also allows for highly disgruntled employees. What if you were a loyal employee with a company for 2+ years and they hire a recent college grad (with little to no experience) to join your team and do the exact same role as you, but start them at significantly higher pay? As I stated this is a great ""job"" for the recent grad who wants to get their feet wet in B2B sales, build experience, grow their personal brand, and move on.. I say ""job"" because after about a year with the company, I saw no opportunity, and no desire to grow a career within Lenovo and started looking elsewhere.

There are too many layers of management, while the managers mostly work very hard and are good at what they do, they don't seem to be delegated any really decision making authority on products. When new ideas need to bubble up through 6 layers of management they tend to die without any real consideration.

As a part of the global team, working remote, I enjoy a flexible schedule. Lenovo also has twice yearly reviews, where bonuses and merit increases are awarded.
","Lenovo is a company of middle aged men pretending that they know how to market to millennials, without ever asking millennials their opinions. It's also a company that claims they run themselves like a startup, but really what that means is that after 10 years, they're still frantic and unorganized. While talent exists within Lenovo, it is rarely found at the executive level. A favorite quote among the executive team is ""the strategy is clear"", when generally they have not formulated a strategy at all. At Lenovo, you rise through the ranks because of company politics, not because you have proven your skill or helped the company achieve goals. While every team has a different dynamic and experience, I overall find the the corporate atmosphere to be unauthentic and uninspiring.

","The North America Services organization is not a good area to work at Lenovo. All big companies have bad pockets, but this team has surely been the most corrupt and politically-diluted that I have ever worked on. Approximately two months ago, we received new org charts and official announcements that there were people promoted into positions that were never posted or opened for applications. Sadly, this won’t be the first time I have seen blatant unfairness in my time at the company and in this department. After being personally solicited for meaningful charitable contributions by upper management, we had one person make quite a large donation that was not anonymous (it was listed by their name on the charity website) and they have been promoted 2x in less than a year. So if these are the paths to success, hard work will get you nowhere at this company. Be prepared to donate or brown nose your way to the team of favorites because that is the only way that you can succeed here. Hard work is not recognized, only favorites and folks who chose to play the awful game of politics. The recent organizational promotions, which were confirmed by HR to not be official, indicate that there is zero regard for fairness and they are even openly ok with being unfair. It is not fair to the employees who may wish to apply and get an opportunity to obtain the position, and it is not fair to myself and my teammates who may have missed an opportunity to have more qualified management. Also, there should be no surprises that the same rules do not apply to everyone. We have plenty of folks who heavily abuse the vacation policy and experience no consequences. Maybe you will be lucky and be one of those folks, but I have worked every day I have taken PTO, and also some holidays, only to sit back and watch those who abuse the system get rewarded. We also have folks who do not adhere to a professional dress code but suffer no consequences. All the while, we have repeatedly had high school speeches on dress code. It seems the folks who do these things get away with it while everyone else pays the price. This is not an ethical place to work and honestly, I believe that some of the actions that myself and my teammates have experienced are not even legal. I would advise to stay away from Lenovo if you have values and would like a fair place to work. I believe there are some good pockets at the company, but I have no located them yet. I just know that North America Services has embodied nothing but stress and hijinks, and no one does anything about it despite the changes in more fake management.

","Lots of odd-hour calls (early AM, late PM sometimes past 11PM), makes work-life balance difficult & tough to disconnect from work - these aren't optional, its necessary when working closely with teams in Asia. Morale (at least in the US) is a roller-coaster, but hovers in the low. Some product teams feel restricted & unable to truly compete with the competition. Advancement & promotion has a clear path one day, then is fuzzy & timing is off on other days. It's tough to find a path to promotion even through straightforward conversations with management. Opportunities for individual development & education didn't seem to exist within the company. Strategy from Executives is a mixed-bag, but took a weird turn. Seems scattered, needs focus. Quality & supplier problems have become more consistent, which is concerning - customers are beginning to notice. The work of some disciplines isn't considered important when its inconvenient. If the results of your work are unpopular, a VP might yell at you in the middle of a meeting.

","no long term/mid term/short term strategy. Feedbacks from employees are never listened.Upper management seem to have a 2 years agenda max. They maximize their bonuses and they leave, leaving behind debris and problems. Pivotal roles in the company often taken by people with no experience in sales, and no other background than hardware or Lenovo itself. No clear visibility on road map/product map. Although we state we are a customer centric company, the least of our efforts are dedicated to listen to their feedbacks/complaints. A company which calls its (non) strategy WE ARE LENOVO speaks for itself. Targets are scientifically calculated not ot be reached, by the same people i talked about few lines beforehand....Lenovo is the Ryanair of IT
