2021-09-26, Senior Java Developer,,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",Not at all good company to work.. Read carefully ..,"Good discounts on Sony products , Samagama annual day...
","Incompetent management in Sony India with focus on cost cutting and layoffs resulting in loss of all projects to consulting vendors. Too much focus on cost cutting and thereby making it as a operational mess in india center. Sony subsidiary entities are not trusting Sony India capabilities n giving all new projects to vendors (consulting firms). No learning curve for technology based employees. Layoffs are also done during pandemic period.

Plan is to move existing projects to a vendor company. This is planned across all service lines .. Don't see any future for employees in SISCPL.Also, no career growth for technical people...
Advice to Management
don't focus only on cost measures and show slides on cost savings.Need to really focus on innovation and avoid moving projects to vendors. Keep good technology focused or results driven people in key positions..

","It seems really to take quite a long time to convince leaders and long-term colleagues about new ideas. The work load is rather high, one employee seems to be expected to achieve alone what at other companies several employees would achieve by cooperative work.

","I was laid off.... during the pandemic. I then interviewed within Sony and had a few of the worst interview experiences of my life and was even sent generic automated rejection letters. Honestly after working there over three years and the sting of being laid off and made vulnerable during a pandemic from a company that was bringing in so much money.. and then to be treated not so nice after... Pretty surprising and based on the experience I had working there.

When the company you work hard for post record profits but your targets are made unachievable, your wage reduces (inflation, unachievable targets) its demotivating. Itd be nice to value the employees that deliver week in week out, year in year out, instead of making it impossible to earn a decent wage.

Advice to Management
The Company should employ detailed business plans and strategies in order to gain several benefits from its competitors such as increased profits and enhanced customer relations as company objectives. Gaining customer loyalty is a corporate challenge today in this increasingly competitive and crowded marketplace because of the eventual profitability it will provide. The changing business world allowed customers to change as well and company management has to shift their focus on their clients or customers so as to stay successfully in business with the need to completely reformulate their conventional business aims and purposes from being process-focused to customer-centered. With the advent of technological innovations, logistical decisions about delivery operations, stockholding, warehousing and economies of scale get more complex solutions in today’s business environment.

","Bullying by line managers who are not suited to their position through their character, being unskilled or badly self developed.
Japanese, Heads of Department who have little proficiency in the English language, have no understanding of what is taking place within their team. Nice but not fit for a position where they have responsibility for people. Failure in duty of care.
Employee survey results are ignored/hidden by management in teams where real issues exist with management. Employees then decide there is no point in completing the survey as the results are not taken seriously and no action is taken to improve. Employees scared to be open about the management issues out with the anonymity of the survey as concerned their position will be compromised.
HR pleasant and try and support but questionable what power/effectiveness they have and what action is being taken to address cases of bullying and poor people managers.
Advice to Management
Choose your managers who have responsibility for people carefully, some people are not suited to these positions. 
If employees take time to complete the employee survey, make it transparent in all teams, don’t allow the results to be hidden by the managers of teams where issues exist. 
Address bullying and follow-up with care for the employees in cases where mental health issues have been caused by bullying within the organisation.

2019-10-08, Venture Capital Analyst,,"Former Employee, less than 1 year","Interesting job role, okay management, but mis-sold job description.","Huge reach to new industries and technologies if you're interested in the cutting edge.
Potential to travel a lot.
Interesting team members so always a fun chat.
","Cafe was more expensive than Deliverooing every day.

Management members would contradict each other's decisions, and Business Unit's would always expect something for nothing in terms of ""helping out"".

No transparency in team-goals or direction, often hard to see the big picture.

Job was advertised and interviewed for somewhere, job wasn't actually positioned there, decided after 8 months of ""we'll move, don't worry"" to just leave.
Advice to Management
Decide on clear team goals and share that knowledge with the team, rather than contradicting each other.

Advertise job location, benefits, and expectations as the job will actually be.

As team expands and becomes more useful to other Business Units this role will be even more exciting, will say that I enjoyed learning so much, so keep pushing for team growth.

AVOID!
","- Salaries and benefit packages are not competitive especially given commute costs (from London or other). 
- You're stuck in the middle of nowhere so your lunch break recreation/food options are limited. 
- Misleading job descriptions means you may end up in the wrong role. 
- Destructive and bullying senior management that encourages a toxic backstabbing culture within the team, and often ridicule employees in public. 
- Favouritism for Japanese employees. 
- Backwards culture that rewards loyalty over ability. 
- Management by fear. 
- Outside (non-Sony) experience is not valued. 
- Backwards culture that isolates women. In an office of 400 employees, not a single female in a leadership position - in this day and age! 
- Misleading bonus structure proposed by line manager with the knowledge that targets are completely unachievable and out of your influence. 
- Overtime is demanded by managers, but withholding the key fact that overtime can be claimed back. Why do you hide this benefit from your team? 
- Certain incompetent employees are protected by senior management so they stick around for years despite all stakeholders (including HR) being aware of their deficiencies.
- No empowerment at all, no decision making-power even for positions that require 10+ years of experience. Complete micro-management. 
- HR try to be supportive but their hands are tied by strict archaic culture that protects the wrong people. 
- Working from home is not allowed except for extreme circumstances (snow, etc.). Again, in this day and age! 
- Destructive culture that highlights mistakes/areas of development but offers zero support or solutions.

The worst part was the lack of team spirit, encouraged by managers. Constant bullying, backstabbing and being thrown under the bus. Not a nice place to work at all.
Advice to Management
By far, the worst professional experience I have had in 20 years working for large multinational corporations. 
Quit your backwards and patriarchal ways, embrace technology and give employees flexibility which will actually boost productivity and performance, work-life balance and general happiness! Stop with the race and gender discrimination. 
Just treat people better. You should be ashamed of your management style.

"," it can be demotivating to see that there are a previgilant ones .
Regarding salary. Average on the market, no salary rise, it is linked to a title promotion. To be promoted there is a queue of employees to be promoted so it will not happen. Promotion is linked to personal loyalty and office politics. So no salary rise. So negotiate from the beginning. 
If you see yourself spending hours in a kitchen talking to people drinking coffee, working 1 hour a day probably this work for you. If you want to improve your competences and work on something challenging and you want to see a clear ladder to climb, try something else.
Cons
Cons: for 150 employees around 20 managers, you will be reporting to several ones. Almost all the personal spend time on the meetings. No clear plans, plans are changing every month, there will be no chance to be responsible for anything. 

Cons: Low technical level of managers. Strange decisions, you will be forced to work using something you will not use in your future work. Poor technical feedback, you will learn nothing from it. 
Pro: From another side there are good engineers, still not everyone good left the company. If you will be lucky you can learn something from f2f talks with them.

2019-05-02, Expert Software Engineer,Istanbul,"Former Employee, less than 1 year",Big disappointment,"Annual leave. (18 days instead of 14 days)
Free coffee
","Turnover rate is so high. Most of the developers are leaving the company in a short period (less than 3 years). There are just a couple of employees, most of them are managers, team leads who have been working for more than 5 years. You hear cost cutting usually in the IT meetings. Firing employees, even they perform good, is not unordinary. Sony is losing market share and they are trying to survive by cost-cutting. Sony Turkey is also being smaller. (When I started, there were approximately 90 employees. After 6 or 7 months, there were around 65 employees.) Sony Turkey works on a project basis. They have a unit for each project. When the project finish, they are closing the unit. Then they may fire you or may suggest another role if exists. (Sony Turkey cannot get new projects, Sony India is getting new projects because of Indian's lower cost employee advantage. ) 

I worked with a bad manager. She may be one of the worst managers that I worked in the last 11 years. She did not know the technology well. When there is a problem, she even could not understand the reason for the problem. She says just do this, do that; like a typical boss but she just says the obvious and simple tasks. When there is complexity, you could not get help and feedback from your manager. Even you need to explain the situation, sometimes you need to explain technical things. 

Sony Turkey is too far away from being innovative and high-tech.
Advice to Management
You may choose better managers.
I do not think agile teams need team leads (officially delivery managers). Agile teams are autonomous and self-driving. How can you criticise your manager in the scrum retrospective meeting?

I learned a lot about the process and grew as a professional, received decent benefits, paid a competitive salary for the San Francisco area. Worked with intelligent and smart people.
","My tenure took a strange turn as the department management was replaced with someone who had a very nationalistic view on the company. From then on, my Bay Area counterparts started to be ignored a lot more and favoritism started to show. 

It was such a damn shame because I absolutely loved working for this company and everything it represented for the product I worked on. I wish I could have continued working here for the rest of my life and I would have highly considered retiring with them, but I didn't want to be undermined for who I am.

My first 2 years I rate 4-5 stars. My last 2 years I rate 2 stars.

2018-11-13, Assistant Manager,Dubai,"Former Employee, less than 1 year",Rubbish - don't waste your time for the hype of this dying 'Brand',"If you are a wash-out and have no other employment prospects with a true reputable company, pros for you would include:

Great work-life balance! Unless you live in anywhere near Dubai or in Sharjah, then expect a (roughly) 2 hour commute ONE WAY in the company bus. Their HQ is halfway to Abu Dhabi. No need to stay and work late, unless your boss is working late too. Show your dedication to work, stay on doing nothing for no overtime. Oh, and if you have a car, be prepared to be told they have no space in the lot (all reserved for the bigwigs) and wont take responsibility for any muck-ups that may happen on premises.

Free Lunch! Oily, unhealthy, tasteless food, dirty pantry and lack of choice. Great way to stay in touch with your Doctor. If you don't want it, no problem! Ask them to not give you lunch and bump up your salary in lieu of, and let us all know if you succeed.

Multicultural environment! Yes, among the sea of Indians and Filipinos, you may spot the odd Arab or Pakistani, except ofcourse for the HODs who are mostly all Japanese and don't socialise much. Also, employees love spending time at work to cater to everyone's religious festivals; I mean why not? You're expected to stay on late anyway, might as well dance around and put on a couple of skits. Employee Engagement at the cost of a family life or time at the gym, you'd be stuck in traffic anyway, yay!

Career Progression! Haven't received an education above a bachelors from an unheard of university? Haven't stayed up to date and relevant in your chosen field? Cant get ahead anywhere else? Got 5 years to spare to move up? Come on over!

Employee discount! Learn about the tiny margins and then jump through hoops and red-tape; this comes naturally if you're used to working in the failing government entities or 'developing nations'. Be grateful you're getting anything at all!

Simple! Yes, no need to use your experience, education, wits or industry know-how, just do what they tell you to do and no need for any inputs. I mean hey, surely these guys are still number one for a reason right? They haven't slipped at all in terms of product, R&D, marketing at all right? Right?

Long term vision! The Heads keep rotating every 3-4 years and so are only concerned with their immediate results, who cares about long term goals or presence? That's a great strategy, let's keep everyone as happy as possible for now, let the other guys figure out the issues when they crop up, I certainly won't be around.

Pay and benefits! Haven't you heard? They're the best! You'll get the lowdown when you join and learn about the Compa-ratio. Be grateful, you get free lunch, company transport, 'employee engagement', and other things which SOUND great...if you haven't worked at a proper MNC or first rate firm before.
","No cons....except that you will meet some really great people who will leave before the year is out when they realise that all the Pros above don't really work out for high-performance people with two brain cells and good industry experience. Don't believe me? Do a LinkedIn search for yourself. I should have done it and saved myself the headache of working for a great company ruined by sub-par people who couldn't jump ship because no one else would take them.

Simple coworkers! No drama as all the ones that have stayed are such lovely, docile, gentle folk. Busy lil worker bees all buzzing about to get a job done like drones. If you're lucky some will actually tell you truth and how they feel, but most are happy to live risk-free work lives and not make an actual effort to contribute to making the place better. Sheeple.

They say that age and where your passport are from don't matter; the pattern would suggest other wise, but hey what do I know, I've only been working in HR in this part of the world for a decade....

If you feel the review has a lot of vitriol, then reach out to someone who has left the company in less than a year and ask them why. Otherwise you're more than welcome to dismiss this and take the risk, it doesn't matter to anyone apart from you, your career and your family.
Advice to Management
Get rid of the 'Old Guard', they need to be put out to pasture. Get some fresh blood and LISTEN TO THEM, they know what your competitors are doing, they are aware of best practices, and most importantly, a different and certainly more effective and efficient way of working. You cant expect a pool of people who have working in the same company for a decade to give you new ideas. 

And for heaven's sake, if you claim to be an 'above average' brand with 'above average' products, please get 'above average' people and pay them above averagely. If you pay peanuts you'll get monkeys! Speaking of, it's a known fact that most employees don't leave jobs, they leave managers.

Please, please, please recognise people based on merit and performance, and NOT on the country of origin or language they speak.

I joined based on Kaz's vision and efforts to turn things around, but let's just say that the 'trickle down effect' was taken way to seriously here (I can only speak to the MEA 'team', I know my colleagues in other territories have it better...slightly).

I look forward to your products, when they are heavily discounted. But I certainly would not want to work here ever again; it takes years to build a culture, even if you start afresh. 

I'd rather spend my time and passion where it an be put to some use and I get remunerated fairly for it.

2018-09-28,Anonymous,,Former Employee,A successful company moving too slowly living on past glory,"Highly ambitious projects are achieved eventually and the company is comfortable to be an early adopter of change.
Sony Electronics is the most organised of all the Sony sister groups.
","The speed of change is ice age slow, the decision matrix for simple changes is ridiculous. The culture is one of consensus before change which slows down decisions greatly.
Culture is stagnant and not cutting edge as you'd expect from a well established electronics company. 
Innovation of a broader product portfolio is poor. New versions of the same category of products are released year after year. Aibo, PlayStation Classic and releasing a watch well after everyone else has done it are examples of a lack of innovation.
Mainly only Japanese men will achieve high level roles, although there are a few examples of diversity in the US.
There is a culture of the haves and have not's amongst sister companies, PlayStation and the rest.
Feedback is requested through global employee surveys but it is a lip service exercise and no action is taken.
Advice to Management
Even though Sony is a Japanese company let Europeans run Europe and stop placing Japanese ex-pats into senior management positions.
Drive ""One Sony"" and stop letting Electronics, Music, Pictures and PlayStation work as separate companies. 
Put real energy and effort into genuine innovation and find the next big thing instead of reinventing the wheel.

I worked as a Sony tv and audio expert for a year and I must say the support and guidance I received from my manager Barry was second to none, at the time I joined I had no manager for three months and once Barry joined I was weak in my performance however he always encouraged me and pushed me to move forward, when I was behind on target he would visit me and instead of focusing on my negatives would always push me towards what I’m doing right and always reassure me I’m doing better and better which gradually improved my performance. I had a lot of personal issues going on at the time management were always understanding and extremely supportive I’m extremely grateful for the experience I had as a Sony tv and audio expert on behalf of Sony and I will never forget it I have yet to find such encouraging, supportive and motivating individuals. Once again thank you.

I always feel people comes before the profit. Unless people give their loyalty willfully, no one can get it from them. So motivate the working force to work loyally and get better profit each year. This is not always by giving them Monetary benefits. Analyse the employees and empower them based on their competences to take bigger challenges to meet higher business objectives. Train and Develop them to get their skills and attitude better to support business. Recognize them based on performance! Enforce same rules (not benefits) for all employees so that they will stand firm behind Management to support the Company. Must have capable HR department to address the concerns of Employees if any.

2017-09-17, Digital Marketing Manager,,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","You learn a lot, yet no real career path and with little pay.","Great colleagues, really great non-toxic environment, no cut-throat competition, brilliant school-like orientation and also there is a great emphasis on learning internal tools, products and endless trainings (as much as you want), great chance to work on cool projects with different Sony offices, ability to take great responsibility as juniors, chance to travel extensively and network between different offices. Great fresh out of college experience, but no need to stay more than a couple of years
","Management is not fair when it comes to promotions.
You might be punished by managing a team although you have great projects on the side.
Salary is way below industry standards/competitors.
It is a global company on paper, but no chance for global mobility (applying for other offices and rotation is extremely difficult).
The more years you spend at Sony (8-10 years) the more respected you are, if you are less experienced in an internal meeting , your opinion never matters.
Insane turnover, the year I left 15 people left within the same year from a department of 50 people.
They let all their ""go getters"" leave, as they cannot manage or motivate or let the person grow.
Management is scared by being replaced for new comers to take their jobs.
You might come across with 50 people across different Sony offices globally who are doing exactly the same thing with you. (Talk about why there is little pay!)
There is no visible structure, team setup or division/department mentality in different offices. You can never find its equivalent in a different office.
Too much bureaucracy, and at the end of the day Tokyo HQ calls the shots, no regional flexibility.
They spend incredible amounts of money to do things exactly the same it was before, just call it a different name, impossible to understand their decision making, super inefficient programs in marketing.
Advice to Management
What is killing Sony - and partly responsible of its status in the industry - is the so-called ""brand equity"" only Sony employees (with 20+ experience at Sony and never worked for another company) thinks or believes in. That brand equity you think Sony has, was in 90s where buying Sony was considered a status symbol, and that game changed so much and a while ago.

Try to keep your employees who love your company, who took tons of responsibility to grow, multitask working with projects which are not even their core responsibility. 

Stop counting the days of employees and compare, when it comes to deliver promotions, measure results, not years.

Do not kill one employees career by giving them a team responsibility, and just limit their success by motivating the team. Just hire a manager. You cant have a principal specialist and manager at the same time. Similarly not everyone wants to manage a team to move up.

Give your employees a chance to rotate between different teams and offices, they will never bypass you, let them grow. When they grow, you will look better. Not the other way around.

Stop thinking working for the same company for 10+ years is a good thing, we are in 2000s now, people with more management experience can bring you some fresh air and shake things up.

With doing exactly the same things, you cannot expect a different result, unfortunately Sony will never recover, and will be able to compete on par with its real competitors.

2017-06-26, Sales Representative,"Stockton-on-Tees, England, England",Former Employee,Will rip the happiness right out of you,"- Good pay for what is ultimately glorified retail
- The initial and new product training in Weighbridge is top notch
- Set shift patterns
- Other promoters are great and will offer support whenever asked
","- WhatsApp used for Managers to ""chat"" to promoters becomes a way for managers to harass their employees outside of work about targets and issues in store. 
- Managers unable to listen to legitimate criticism or concerns of the people in store and would rather paint them as negative feelings. 
- Comparisons to other stores happen on a week to week basis even if the store in question has less hurdles for the promoters to work with. 
- Full documents of work given to be done outside of work for no pay. (I am aware training documents are required but a quick pocket guide test is one thing, a near 4000 word, 18 page document is another) 
- Managers will often come to store to check if certain products have been sold and how they have been sold, rather than ask the in-store promoters who work there
- Encourages practices that break the stores code of conduct in regards to aggressive sales techniques. 
- Demand the in-store promoters get log on information for the store to access sales information to report back to management.
Advice to Management
Take a look at how your area and regional managers actually manage. The WhatsApp chats are a horrendous idea and perpetuate a mentality of being unable to escape work even after your shift is finished due to management wanting to know every piece of information about the day and being unable to listen to any criticism or legitimate points because of *Insert Sony is the best statement here*. 
Shake up your lower management and take a look at how they operate and talk to their staff... And start paying for the Sales Information rather than forcing your staff into gathering the data off of the in-store systems themselves.

","The silos are a real problem. The company does not function as a unit. More like a group of fiefdoms, sometimes resulting in a mess. Lost market leadership in numerous industries. Also, Tokyo has a lot of control since they usually pay the budget. Local people feel they are not really valued.
Advice to Management
Do more to break down the silos. And do something to save the mobile division, which is falling further and further behind the industry leaders (currently Apple and Samsung).

","I think i will not be alone in this- culture is very very. Bad. People will 'defend' their pals, some 'childish/school like' graduates that go around the office flirting with each other!? Others speaking in Japanese constantly (in a UK based office where the spoken language is English). This occurs even during meetings! People are ridiculed openly and infront of others... laughing, eye rolling and all the non sense you may see in a comedy show goes on in this company! I have never seen anything like it! Speechless... good luck to all! Once i raised some views openly i was labelled as completely 'incompetent' / irrespective of 4 interviews that by the same people who made the accusations! If they don't like you they also have a method of pushing you out the door (head first!)
