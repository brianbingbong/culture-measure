These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and may involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may affect the Company’s actual results, performance, achievements or financial position, making them materially different from the actual future results, performance, achievements or financial position expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.  
New standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not effective for the annual period beginning on January 1, 2017, and not early adopted by the Company, are as follows: Korean IFRIC 2122, Foreign Currency Transaction and Advance Consideration  According to these enactments, the date of the transaction for the purpose of determining the exchange rate to use on initial recognition of the related asset, expense or income (or part of it) is the date on which an entity initially recognizes the non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability arising from the payment or receipt of advance consideration. If there are multiple payments or receipts in advance, the entity shall determine a date of the transaction for each payment or receipt of advance consideration. These enactments will be effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the enactments to have a significant impact on the financial statements.  Korean IFRS 1109, Financial Instruments  The new standard for financial instruments issued on September 25, 2015 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018 with early application permitted. This standard will replace Korean IFRS 1039 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. The Company will apply the standard for the annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018.   The standard requires retrospective application with some exceptions. For example, the entity is not required to restate prior periods 
amounting to ₩3,199 million was recycled from equity to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment for the year ended December 31, 2017.  The Company plans to designate long-term equity instruments held for long-term investment purposes, which account for most of the available-for-sale equity instruments, as financial instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. Therefore, the Company expects the application of Korean IFRS 1109 on these financial assets will not have a material impact on the financial statements. However, the Company has identified that some available-for-sale equity instruments will have increased profit or loss variability, as they are classified as fair value through profit or loss.  According to Korean IFRS 1109, debt investments for which the contractual terms of cash flows are not solely representing payments of principal and interest, or which are held for trading, are classified as fair value through profit or loss. Equity investments not designated at fair value through comprehensive income are also measured at fair value through profit or loss. As at December 31, 2017, the Company did not have debt or equity investments classified as financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss. 
(d) Hedge Accounting  Hedge accounting mechanics (fair value hedges, cash flow hedges and hedges of net investments in foreign operations) required by Korean IFRS 1039 remains unchanged in Korean IFRS 1109, however, the new hedge accounting rules will align the accounting for hedging instruments more closely with the Company’s risk management practices. As a general rule, more hedge relationships may be eligible for hedge accounting, as the standard introduces a more principles-based approach. Korean IFRS 1109 allows more hedging instruments and hedged items to qualify for hedge accounting, and relaxes the hedge accounting requirement by removing two hedge effectiveness tests: the prospective test to ensure that the hedging relationship is expected to be highly effective and the quantitative retrospective test (within range of 80~125%) to ensure that the hedging relationship has been highly effective throughout the reporting period.  With the implementation of Korean IFRS 1109, volatility in profit or loss may be reduced as some items that were not eligible as hedged items or hedging instruments under Korean IFRS 1039 are now eligible under Korean IFRS 1109.  When the Company first applies Korean IFRS 1109, it may choose its accounting policy to continue to apply all of the hedge accounting requirements of Korean IFRS 1039 instead of the requirements of Korean IFRS 1109.  With the implementation of Korean IFRS 1109, the Company has aligned the application of hedge accounting requirements more closely with risk management practices. It is expected that the impact of adopting Korean IFRS 1109 will not be significant.   
As a result of analyzing the agreement terms, the Company considers the revenue from custom-order semiconductor supply contracts with no alternative use and an enforceable right to payment should be recognized over time. The adoption of Korean IFRS 1115 is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements.   (d) Variable consideration    According to Korean IFRS 1115, the Company shall recognize a refund liability if the entity receives consideration from a customer and expects to refund some or all of the consideration to the customer. The Company recognizes an asset (refund asset) for the Company’s right to recover the products from the customer when the refund liability is paid.   The Company considers that the refund asset should be classified and presented separately from the refund liability. The adoption of Korean IFRS 1115 is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements.  Enactment of Korean IFRS 1116, Leases   Korean IFRS 1116 Leases issued on May 22, 2017 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. This standard will replace Korean IFRS 1017 Leases, Interpretation 2104 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease, Interpretation 2015 Operating Leases-Incentives, and Interpretation 2027 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease.  At inception of a contract, the Company shall assess whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. Also, at the date of initial application, the Company shall assess whether the contract is, or contains, a lease in accordance with the standard. However, the Company will not need to reassess all contracts with applying the practical expedient because the Company elected to apply the practical expedient only to contracts entered before the date of initial application.  For a contract that is, or contains, a lease, the Company shall account for each lease component within the contract as a lease separately from non-lease components of the contract. A lessee is required to recognize a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying leased asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments. The lessee may elect not to apply the requirements to short-term leases (a lease term of 12 months or less at the commencement date) and low value assets (e.g. underlying assets below $5,000). In addition, as a practical expedient, the lessee may elect, by class of underlying asset, not to separate non-lease components from lease components, and instead account for each lease component and any associated non-lease components as a single lease component.  The accounting standard as a lessor did not change significantly from Korean IFRS 1017 Leases.  (a) Lessee accounting  A lessee shall apply this standard to its leases either: a) retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented applying Korean IFRS 1008 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors (Full retrospective application) or b) retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard recognized at the date of initial application. The Company has not yet elected an adoption method.  The Company is in the process of performing a preliminary assessment of potential financial impact of applying Korean IFRS 1116 to the 2017 financial statements.   (b) Lessor accounting  When applying Korean IFRS 1116, the Company does not expect the enactments to have a significant impact on the financial statements as the accounting standard as a lessor did not change significantly from IFRS 1017.

In 2019, the penetration rate of mobile phones will reach 80%, slightly increasing from 79% in 2018 (Strategy Analytics, April 2018).  The mobile phone industry started with first generation analogue phones in the early 1980s and evolved to second generation digital ones, using technology such as CDMA and GSM, where users could send voice and text messages. Third generation mobile communication standards such as WCDMA allowed users to send photos and videos. Today, fourth generation LTE mobile communication technology with ultra-high-speed data transmission is becoming commonplace and is used in 76% of phones sold in 2018 (Strategy Analytics, September 2018). Now, fifth generation mobile communication service, which will lead innovation alongside the fourth industrial revolution, is preparing to accelerate commercialization.   The smartphone industry has grown significantly since 2007. In 2019, the smartphone portion of total HHPs is expected to reach 78%. The feature phone portion of the total remained flat at 22% led by demand markets in developing nations (Strategy Analytics, December 2018).  Also, as the smartphone market shows high saturation, the importance of competitive software and services—such as applications, UX, mobile payments, AI, and AR—is rising alongside that of competitive hardware, which includes high- performance APs, AMOLED displays, multiple cameras, sensors, and waterproof & dustproof features.   Market Condition

In the DRAM market, inventory corrections in 2019, mainly by data centers, was behind weak demand from some customers, but a recovery is expected in 2020. Although external factors such as the US-China trade conflict tightened export regulations add to uncertainty, we plan to expand our market share by gaining an early edge in the market for high- density memory for new CPUs and by addressing expansion of the 5G smartphone market in a timely manner.   Overall NAND demand has been bolstered by rising demand for SSDs in the growing cloud services market and a trend toward high density in the PC market alongside demand linked with the expansion of 5G and upcoming launches of new game consoles. Declines in ASP due to a supply glut are expected to soften.  < Market share of the Semiconductor Business’ main product >
